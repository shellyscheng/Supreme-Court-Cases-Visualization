3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument first this morning in case 15-214, Murr v. 5 Wisconsin. 6 Mr. Groen. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. GROEN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. GROEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 The fundamental unfairness in this case is 12 illustrated by one fact: If anyone else in the world, 13 other than the Murr siblings, owned Lot E, that owner 14 could sell or develop it. But the Murrs cannot. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Groen, may I ask -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this 17 question. It's a hypothetical. It's not this case. 18 Suppose that three years from now lots such as these two 19 lots in the same ownership become immensely more 20 valuable than the two lots singly. Each lot singly 21 would be worth a hundred thousand, but these lots where 22 you can build a bigger home are worth $500,000. 23 The county wants a fire -- fire station and 24 it takes Lot E. What do they pay for it under your 25 theory?
Alderson Reporting Company

4 1 MR. GROEN: They should pay for -2 compensation for the taking of Lot E. Any taking -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is $100,000. So 4 under your hypothetical, property owners stand to lose 5 $300,000 under my hypothetical and your answer. 6 MR. GROEN: No, I don't think so. Under the 7 hypothetical -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The hypothetical is 9 together, they are worth 500,000; singly, they're worth 10 a hundred thousand each. 11 What is the amount that the -- the county 12 has to pay to take Lot E for the fire station? 13 MR. GROEN: The analysis must begin with 14 defining the relevant parcel that's the subject of the 15 case analysis. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in your view, that's 17 Lot E only. 18 MR. GROEN: That's right. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And they pay $100,000 20 only. That's it. 21 MR. GROEN: The land owner would have the 22 burden of proving that there are additional damages that 23 they should be compensated for. But the presumption -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You indicated there's no 25 severance damages. You're taking the entire parcel.

5 1 MR. GROEN: You're taking all of Lot E, and 2 they should be paid compensation for Lot E. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right. 4 MR. GROEN: Whether that compensation is -5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's $100,000 that go 6 under your theory, land owners in the hypothetical that 7 I put up would lose money and the State would be -8 would be getting the windfall. 9 MR. GROEN: If that hypothetical does not 10 include any integrated economic use between those two 11 parcels; that is correct. The compensation is 12 determined by the lot that is taken. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the integrated -- the 14 integrated use is determined by the market. Your -15 your theory completely ignores market factors. 16 MR. GROEN: And that is exactly what the 17 government would argue is that the compensation must be 18 limited to the parcel that is taken. And in eminent 19 domain law, which is the -- the hypothetical that you're 20 providing, in eminent domain law, the presumption is 21 exactly that: Compensation is limited to the parcel 22 taken, unless that presumption can be overcome by the 23 landowner proving that the two parcels are actually -24 yes, there's a unity of use between the two -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't the value --

1 then why isn't that true here? Then why doesn't that

6

2 defeat your theory here?

3 MR. GROEN: It supports the theory. It's

4 the exact same principle, only in reverse. Rather than

5 the government limiting compensation to just the parcel

6 taken, here the government is saying we want to combine

7 the values of the two in order to find there's no

8 taking. But in both scenarios, you have to begin with

9 the presumption of determining what is the relevant

10 parcel that is subject to that analysis. In both

11 scenarios, either eminent domain or inverse

12 condemnation, you have to begin --

13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Groen --

14 MR. GROEN: -- with a single parcel.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- can I ask just a

16 clarifying question about your argument? One of the

17 things that makes this case odd is that there are family

18 members all around. Both sellers are the same family

19 and the buyers are the -- but if I'm right, your

20 argument would extend in the exact same way to a

21 situation where you have two sellers who are completely

22 independent of each other. Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith have

23 nothing to do with each other. Another buyer comes in,

24 also has no relationship with Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith,

25 and that buyer would be able to make the exact same

1 argument that the Murr family is making in this case.

7

2 Am I right about your argument?

3 MR. GROEN: Well, I'm not sure which parcel

4 your -- your hypothetical is talking about.

5 JUSTICE KAGAN: You have --

6 MR. GROEN: But -- but -- but

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- two preexisting

8 substandard parcels. Somebody comes in, buys both, but

9 all the parties are independent of each other.

10 MR. GROEN: Each parcel. Right --

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: And now the person who has

12 bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to

13 build on them, and your argument would be the exact

14 same.

15 MR. GROEN: That -- that's right. They're

16 each independent, discrete, and separate parcels. And

17 the grandfather clause that is attached with this

18 land-use ordinance would protect the development and

19 sale rights of each parcel independently.

20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So where does

21 regulatory -- a State's regulatory power come in?

22 This -- Justice Kagan put in a hypothetical to --

23 to this one owner owns two parcels or two different

24 people own two parcels, and they sell it to your one

25 owner. And the one owner knows the regulation says if

1 you have two contiguous land pieces, you can only

8

2 develop on one, if they're both below an acre or

3 whatever the rule is. Your rule would just do away with

4 your expectations as a buyer.

5 MR. GROEN: Well, no. The -- in that

6 situation, the fact that someone might know that there

7 -- there are regulations on properties does not change

8 the time of the taking. The taking occurs in 1975 when

9 the regulations redefined the property rights, and that

10 redefinition of the property rights does not insulate --

11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the parents -- it

12 may have been a taking for the parents, but they never

13 charged it. The children when they took were subject to

14 the regulation, and they knew it.

15 MR. GROEN: And --

16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They could have said,

17 no, I don't want two contiguous ones, Dad and Mom. I'll

18 go buy the next-door lot from someone else.

19 MR. GROEN: And this Court in Palazzolo v.

20 Rhode Island ruled that the notice that the Murr

21 children may have had -- they actually didn't know, but

22 let's assume that they did know --

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They should have known.

24 MR. GROEN: Let's assume that. Let's assume

25 that beyond should have; they actually knew.

9 1 Palazzolo stands for the proposition that 2 the -- that the -- the subsequent heir or a buyer does 3 not lose a takings claim. The State is not -4 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's a very -5 MR. GROEN: -- absolved of liability. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's a very different 7 situation. In Palazzolo, all we said was that if the 8 seller has a takings claim, it's not extinguished just 9 because the property is transferred; that the buyer 10 could have the exact same takings claim. But the Murr 11 children are not asking for the -- for the -- they do 12 not have the same takings claim as the Murr parents did; 13 isn't that right? 14 MR. GROEN: No, I think that's not right. 15 They have the exact same takings claim because we're 16 talking about Parcel E. And the rights that the 17 parents could -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: The parents could develop on 19 Parcel E; the children can't. 20 MR. GROEN: The parents, if they had put it 21 in their own common ownership, which they did for a 22 period of time. Subsequent to 1975, there is a takings 23 claim there. It's the rights inherent in the property. 24 And in each of these -- in -- in all of these scenarios, 25 you have to go back to define --

10 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: The parents -- let me try 2 this again. 3 For the parents, the two properties were two 4 properties. It's only when the property becomes one 5 property that this takings claim arises. 6 MR. GROEN: The takings claim arises because 7 of the restrictions imposed by the government, not by 8 change in ownership or anything like that. The change 9 in ownership does not change the nature of the property 10 interest. That's the key part of Palazzolo, that if you 11 take away the -- the takings claim or redefine property 12 interests, you're actually changing or altering the 13 nature of property. And -- and that's where we come 14 back not to a takings analysis, but to defining the 15 relevant unit of property to apply the takings analysis. 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: The -- I'm sorry. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please, follow up. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: The -- the -- the regulation 21 here, the only thing that it affected for the Murr 22 parents and for the plumbing company was their ability 23 to sell to a buyer who wanted to combine these two lots. 24 That was the only thing that was affected; isn't that 25 right?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 MR. GROEN: Well, the parents didn't seek to 2 combine these two lots or to sell to someone who wanted 3 to combine the two lots. The parents owned both 4 parcels. They had one in the plumbing company name. 5 They eventually put that in their own names as well in 6 1982, after the 1975 restrictions were in place. That 7 didn't merge the parcels. There's -- there hasn't been 8 a merger here. Merger is simply a term that describes 9 what happened, and that is, that the use restrictions 10 preclude the independent sale or development of Lot E. 11 That is the gravamen of the takings complaint. 12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And we're told these 13 merger rules have a long history. Many States have 14 them. So why isn't that background State law that 15 would -- would apply? 16 MR. GROEN: There -- there are lots of -- of 17 land-use regulations of all types, including merger 18 provisions. We do not have a background provision here, 19 a background principle because you can't have a 20 background principle that applies to one person, but not 21 to another. If someone else owned Lot E, they can 22 develop it. So it's not a background principle to say 23 that -- that this only applies to the Murrs. 24 Same thing in the neighborhood. This is the 25 St. Croix Cove subdivision. There's over 40 developed

There's nothing about building a 2 home on this property that rises to the level of a 3 nuisance or something that takes the right to use the 4 property out of the title that -- that is that 5 property -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer to Justice 7 Ginsburg is that all of those other State regulations 8 are also invalid. 9 MR. GROEN: No. Those regulations are fine, 10 whatever they may be, and they come in all -- all types 11 of forms. The question here is what unit of property do 12 we utilize for determining the takings analysis? 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I -14 MR. GROEN: Once you determine that, then 15 you determine, okay, under that merger law or whatever 16 land-use ordinance, does it reach a level of magnitude 17 of interference that there is a taking? And those would 18 have to be -- be analyzed on the merits of their own 19 situation. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 21 argument was that under State law, the properties were 22 not formally merged, that the merger was only, I think 23 as the Court put it, an effective merger. 24 MR. GROEN: That's exactly right. There -25 there has been no formal merger. These remain separate

13 1 legal lots today. This -- this term "merger" has been 2 used very loosely, and all it really means is that the 3 Murrs' right to independently use and develop Lot E has 4 been destroyed. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Do we know -- do we know 6 exactly -7 MR. GROEN: They could actually still give 8 it away. 9 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. 10 Do we know exactly how Wisconsin and the 11 county define "common ownership"? For example, if one 12 lot is owned by an individual in that person's own name, 13 and then the adjacent lot is owned by a wholly-owned 14 corporation or LLC, is that considered to be common 15 ownership? Or if one lot is owned by, let's say, four 16 siblings and the other one is owned by only three of the 17 siblings, would that be common ownership? 18 MR. GROEN: Under the way Wisconsin has 19 applied common ownership, as long as they are not 20 informally the same name -- so here William and Dorothy 21 Murr, they fully owned their plumbing company, and so 22 they were technically in -- in different ownership and 23 that was enough to be in separate -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be enough if -25 MR.

GROEN: -- and bring in the incentives. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I've not got beyond 10 Holmes. Holmes says that a regulatory taking violates 11 the Constitution unless it's compensated when it goes 12 too far. 13 MR. GROEN: Correct. 14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what you 15 want us to do is to put some pretty clear lines in that 16 word "too far." 17 MR. GROEN: Well -18 JUSTICE BREYER: My problem is, I can't 19 think of just what those lines should be, that -- that, 20 perhaps, there are many different circumstances in many 21 different factors. 22 For example, in your case, I imagined that 23 what the State was concerned about is they want to 24 preserve a lake. At the same time, people own some 25 property around that lake and they used to be able to

15 1 build houses. So here's what they say. You can build 2 one. One. And it doesn't matter if you have six lap 3 parcels not together or -- one. One is what you can 4 build because, after all, this Constitution is concerned 5 about, to paraphrase Justice Warren, protecting people, 6 not rocks. 7 And so we look at the people and say, how 8 does this affect them. And in this case, you have a 9 case, but there's some factors against you, and the -10 the Federal Circuit and other opinions of ours have 11 avoided drawing clear lines. 12 And you see where I'm going. And I just 13 want your general response. 14 MR. GROEN: Yes. This case does not address 15 the merits of whether there's a taking. This case first 16 has to deal with the threshold question of what is the 17 relevant unit of property -18 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what I'm 19 objecting to. 20 MR. GROEN: -- and is it one parcel -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, see that's -- now 22 you're not getting my question. 23 Because my question is: Why look for that? 24 Is it relevant? Yes. Is it determinative?

They're 7 written about in the briefs. 8 MR. GROEN: Well -9 JUSTICE BREYER: I want your general 10 reaction. 11 MR. GROEN: Well, the general reaction is 12 you must begin with the approved legal lots of record 13 that have actually been approved and that have 14 attained -- because they are legal lots of record, they 15 have rights that's in dispute. 16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Groen, one of 17 the -18 MR. GROEN: That's what Roth is all about. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: One of the oddities of your 20 position is that you seem to be taking half of State 21 law. In other words, you're saying well, there are 22 these -- there are these lot lines, and everything has 23 to depend on the lot lines because they've been legally 24 approved. But there have been other things in this case 25 that have been legally approved too, and one of them is
Alderson Reporting Company

1 this merger provision. And you seem to be saying:

17

2 Well, we look to State law for the lot lines, but then

3 we ignore State law for the question of when lots are

4 merged.

5 And why should we do that? If we're looking

6 to State law, let's look to State law, the whole ball of

7 wax. In other words, saying: Well, when I buy those

8 two lots, they're really not two lots anymore.

9 According to State law, they are one lot.

10 MR. GROEN: In defining property interests,

11 Roth and this Court in Lucas note 7 both recognized that

12 you look to the State law, not to the whole body of

13 State law, you look to the State law that governs the

14 creation that's the legal recognition of lots and the

15 protection of the property interest.

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I -- I think that

17 you're right, Mr. Groen. It's like the legal

18 recognition of property. But the legal recognition of

19 property has something to do with lot lines, and it also

20 has something to do with when lots are merged, when two

21 lots are merged into one. And why would we ignore that

22 question of merger?

23 MR. GROEN: There's two reasons. One, they

24 have not been merged. That -- and that's the point we

25 were discussing earlier. They have not been formally

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 merged.

18

2 And, two --

3 JUSTICE KAGAN: And what would it take to be

4 formally merged?

5 MR. GROEN: Elimination of lot lines.

6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why?

7 MR. GROEN: And that has not happened.

8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because if the Court --

9 MR. GROEN: Because if -- if they remain --

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: If the State can say we

11 don't have to eliminate lot lines. All we have to do is

12 to say the -- the lot lines don't have legal effect for

13 some purposes.

14 MR. GROEN: And it's only for the limited

15 purposes of precluding sale or development.

16 But more than that, your question comes

17 right back. It circles right back to Palazzolo, where

18 you really have to define property interests by the

19 rights that are already in place that secure benefits.

20 That's what Roth stands for. That's what Lucas footnote

21 7 stands for. And Palazzolo points out the principle

22 that you cannot then go forward and say: Oh, well, the

23 State has redefined this --

24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, again, I think --

25 MR. GROEN: -- so now you --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- Palazzolo depends on the 2 buyers having the exact same takings claim as the 3 sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this 4 case. 5 But let me ask you a different -- a 6 different way around the question, which is, whether you 7 think reasonable expectations matter at all in your 8 framework? 9 MR. GROEN: The reasonable expectations that 10 were addressed in Lucas footnote 7 are the expectations 11 that grow out of the traditional understandings of 12 property law. People understand when they buy a lot in 13 a subdivision that they are buying a -- a -- a lot that 14 has a right of use, that -- that has a deed, that has 15 geographic boundaries, and that's -16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. 17 MR. GROEN: -- what they are relying upon. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: But here, if I'm buying 19 property in this area, I also know that there are these 20 rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and 21 how it is that contiguous lots are understood for 22 purposes of that development potential. So why aren't I 23 buying subject to those preexisting regulations? In 24 other words, this is not a regulation that just happened 25 to me when I was an owner. I'm buying subject to -- and
Alderson Reporting Company

2 first year of law school. And I'm buying, you know,

3 certain metes and bounds, but I'm also buying into a

4 certain set of things about what I can and can't do on

5 the property. So why isn't that perfectly consistent

6 with my reasonable expectations? I'm supposed to know

7 the zoning regulations, and when I buy a house, when I

8 buy a piece of land, I'm buying subject to the

9 preexisting zoning regulations.

10 MR. GROEN: I understand the use of

11 reasonable expectations under the Penn Central for

12 determining whether there is a taking. But here,

13 we're -- we have to first determine what unit of

14 property is it. Is it Lot E, or is it Lot E and F

15 combined? And in that situation you have to look at the

16 creation of the property. Property is property. And it

17 doesn't change --

18 JUSTICE BREYER: But what about -- I -- of

19 course, property is property. But we are still dealing

20 with a provision of the Constitution that, in the

21 regulatory area, is designed to prevent takings that

22 hurt somebody unreasonably. It goes too far.

23 So why isn't what you want to look at one

24 more thing to look at? But we might look at others too.

25 We might look, for example, at whether the individual

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 who bought that property at the time he bought it knew 2 about this restriction. We might look at how, overall, 3 he has hurt in any related way. We might look, for 4 example, at the kind of need that was there, and we 5 might see two big questions. 6 I mean, one big question is -- though it's 7 awfully general -- is, is he being treated unfairly 8 either because we're forcing on him the whole cost or a 9 lot of the cost of something that benefits many, many 10 others, or because we are interfering with 11 investment-backed expectations. 12 I mean, as you read the cases it seems to me 13 there are a set of factors like that. And my problem 14 with your argument is it wants to take one and then 15 apply a kind of mechanical test. 16 MR. GROEN: No. It keeps coming back to 17 you -- the -- the task is to first define the unit of 18 property. The Murrs -- the Murr parents have two 19 separate distinct lots. Each is -- is a -- is a lawful 20 legal building site, and if owned by anyone else, it 21 remains a lawful legal building site. 22 Under the restriction enacted in 1975, it 23 went from two building sites to one building site. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: May I -25 MR. GROEN: That is what has been lost.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But --

22

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: May I ask a question? I

3 do think, as I'm reading all of the briefs in this case,

4 that the issue is how much weight should we be giving to

5 the State boundary lines, the State property lines.

6 You say as a denominator on the takings

7 claim, there -- it's fixed. You used the word

8 "presumption" in your brief, but you haven't explained

9 to me what overcomes the State boundary line -- property

10 lines, so I don't think the word "presumption" has any

11 meaning in your brief.

12 Others, like St. Croix and -- and the

13 government, and embedded in Justice Breyer's question,

14 thinks the denominator should be a more nuanced

15 calculation, although St. Croix, Wisconsin, and the

16 Solicitor General seem to have a different weight to

17 that.

18 So let's start with, is yours a fixed

19 presumption? Does anything ever overcome it?

20 MR. GROEN: Yes.

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or is it, under every

22 circumstance, the denominator?

23 MR. GROEN: In -- in -- you must begin with

24 the presumption of identifying the single parcel. And

25 nobody, as you point out --

GROEN: -- presumption is overcome if 7 you have facts that are sufficient to show in fairness 8 and justice that the individual should bear the burden. 9 And an example, we can draw straight out of eminent 10 domain law. If you have a hotel owned by a person and 11 they own the parking lot next door, there are two 12 separate parcels, and the government is going to condemn 13 the parking lot. The parking lot is used with the hotel 14 as an integrated economic unit. The presumption in 15 eminent domain law is the same principle here. 16 Government is taking only the parking lot, and they will 17 argue we will only pay for the parking lot. 18 The burden then shifts to the property owner 19 to prove that the parking lot is an integrated part of 20 the operation of the hotel. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the difference 22 between that and the factors that the other parties are 23 using that says look at how the property's been used 24 over time. 25 Here, the family has a house on one parcel,

1 a volleyball court and a barbecue storage area on

24

2 another. They use the other parcel -- house on one

3 side, the other parcel has access to the beach. The

4 house has not had an economic value to the children. It

5 was there. They're using it.

6 MR. GROEN: Right.

7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the

8 difference --

9 MR. GROEN: I think you have a --

10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in terms of --

11 MR. GROEN: -- an inaccurate visual

12 understanding of what the parcel is. Lot E, and this

13 went up on summary judgment, is a vacant parcel.

14 There's nothing on Lot E. It is its own independent

15 parcel. The Murrs will sometimes walk across it or

16 maybe play volleyball on it, but it is not an integrated

17 economic unit as in the hotel parking lot and the hotel.

18 In that situation, you can overcome the

19 presumption, and that landowner in that situation will

20 argue that they should be paid compensation --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So why isn't an integrated

22 unit because they had a barbecue? In other words, your

23 hypothetical --

24 MR. GROEN: They don't have a barbecue.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your -- well,

Alderson Reporting Company

1 whatever they have.

25

2 (Laughter.)

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Volley -- volleyball.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Volleyball court.

5 Under your hypothetical, if the hotel was on

6 Lot F and the parking lot was Lot E, what would be the

7 fair value if the State took Lot E for a firehouse?

8 MR. GROEN: The --

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Figure out the fair value?

10 Don't you figure out the value of that on the market to

11 a buyer, not the loss to the seller because he's next

12 door? That has to be.

13 MR. GROEN: The -- the rule begins with

14 paying for the parking lot, and the burden is on the

15 landowner to show that they -- that person should get

16 additional compensation for the impact to the hotel.

17 That's where that comes from.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just can't be if

19 they're separate lots. That's not the law in any State

20 that I know.

21 MR. GROEN: That's the unity of -- of use

22 rule. That is in condemnation all the time. And --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- that's when

24 there's a single parcel.

25 MR. GROEN: No. That's when they're two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 separate parcels. It's the hotel and parking lot

26

2 example.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, under your

4 view, the landowner wins either way.

5 MR. GROEN: It depends on --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the value is great, he

7 gets the double value. If the value is smaller, then he

8 can sell the lot.

9 MR. GROEN: There has to be in --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your example --

11 MR. GROEN: In that -- -- unity of use.

12 So, for example, if -- if the parking lot in

13 the hotel, they were just different parcels, and the --

14 the parking lot was serving some other property and the

15 government took that parking lot, there's no damages to

16 the -- to the parcel with the hotel. There -- and the

17 landowner would not be entitled to anything.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we won't --

19 MR. GROEN: It's the same principle here.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're the one who's

21 insisting on divisible -- on -- on the lots being

22 treated separately, not --

23 MR. GROEN: I'm insisting on --

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not in my question.

25 MR. GROEN: -- the same presumption that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
27 1 begin the analysis by identifying the relevant parcel. 2 Here, that has to be Lot E. It was purchased 3 separately. It's a separate deed. It was purchased for 4 separate purposes, and it is the lot that is regulated. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say you would begin 6 the analysis. What more is there if you're saying we 7 isolate E and E now is of no value. It can't be sold; 8 it can't be built on. What is the consequence of saying 9 we isolate -- we identify Parcel E. Is it the same as 10 if the government physically took Parcel E? 11 MR. GROEN: It's -- it's not a physical 12 taking, but it may have the same practical effect. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a -14 MR. GROEN: -- because the -- the value of 15 Lot E is diminished from $410,000 to $40,000. There's a 16 90 percent decrease in value. And -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is some use 18 that can be made of this other -19 MR. GROEN: Lot E cannot be developed on its 20 own. That ability has been taken away. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but is it -- if 22 you -- the combined properties are sold -23 MR. GROEN: But -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it's going to be a 25 much bigger price tag --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 MR. GROEN: But the --

28

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- than if just F was

3 sold.

4 MR. GROEN: But the question is, the -- the

5 Murrs began with two building sites on separate

6 properties. That was taken away. The value that you're

7 talking about is the value that comes from being able to

8 build. Well, the Murrs already have a house on Lot F.

9 So when you say what is there -- the value afterwards,

10 the better methodology is how much would the Murrs or

11 someone who owned Lot F, with an existing house on

12 Lot F, pay to add land to it? How much would they pay

13 to add Lot E to their existing building site?

14 Now, what the --

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me give you -- let me

16 give you an example which might help me. Let's go back

17 to Holmes case. There's a hundred acres. There are 50

18 columns of coal to hold up the -- to hold up the

19 ceiling. That he says is okay. No compensation. But

20 wait. Suppose instead of one people -- one person

21 owning all 50 acres, suppose 50 people each own one

22 acre. And in some cases, the column runs through the

23 acre and some it doesn't. Does that make any

24 difference?

25 MR. GROEN: That hypothetical is not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 analogous to this situation.

29

2 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't care if it's

3 analogous or not analogous. I'm trying to get my

4 thinking clearer, and oddly enough --

5 MR. GROEN: Same --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- different things make my

7 thinking clearer, and --

8 MR. GROEN: You have --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- this may be one of them.

10 (Laughter.)

11 MR. GROEN: The analysis has to begin by

12 defining the parcel of property that is regulated.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: You opinion -- in your

14 opinion, if, in the Holmes case, instead of one person

15 owning the whole 50 acres as one lot, there would have

16 been 50 people who each owned an acre. Now, it looks

17 the same, you know, the columns are in the same place,

18 et cetera, and you're saying that does make a

19 difference.

20 MR. GROEN: If someone --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?

22 MR. GROEN: It does make a difference. And

23 the key is to look at the parcel of property that is

24 owned by an individual and is that property being taken

25 away.

30 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: So the usual way -2 MR. GROEN: There's two questions here. 3 JUSTICE KAGAN: The usual way, Mr. Groen, or 4 at least a frequent way in which this comes up is a 5 developer buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is 6 split up into 100 one-acre parcels. And let's say 15, 7 one-five, percent of them are on wetlands and can't be 8 built on. It makes an enormous difference whether we're 9 going to say that those 15 percent are independent lots, 10 because if they are, then the developer comes in and 11 says you have to pay me for all of that. But if they're 12 not, the developer is out of luck because it's only 15 13 percent of the whole. Isn't that right? 14 MR. GROEN: The beginning part of your 15 analysis says the developer subdivided. The developer 16 cannot subdivide without government approval. And when 17 there's a subdivision that is created under the laws of 18 that State, then rights attach. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Well, the subdivision 20 has occurred with government approval, and the merger 21 provision has occurred with government approval, saying 22 that this shouldn't be understood in the case of 23 substandard lots as independent. 24 MR. GROEN: The merger provision is like the 25 wetlands provision: Both restrict use. And then the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 question, then, once you've identified the relevant

31

2 parcel in your hypothetical, the -- the -- the question

3 is, is there a taking of that 15 percent.

4 The burden would be on the government to

5 show that that 15 percent of the lots is actually part

6 of an integrated economic unit as a whole, and then you

7 proceed under a takings analysis. But in both

8 situations, you must first define the relevant parcel.

9 Unless there are further questions, I'd like

10 to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

12 Mr. Tseytlin.

13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISHA TSEYTLIN

14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT WISCONSIN

15 MR. TSEYTLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

16 please the Court:

17 I would like to begin, Mr. Chief Justice, by

18 answering your question, or the point that you made.

19 The lots here have merged for all relevant

20 purposes under State law. It is true that the lot line

21 between Lot E and Lot F still exists, but that has

22 absolutely no continuing legal relevance under State

23 law.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your point

25 is -- raises my exact concern. You said "for all

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 relevant purposes." The -- the question is what

32

2 purposes are relevant? And it seems to me that what

3 purposes are relevant is analysis under the Takings

4 Clause.

5 And we all know the -- the issue, I think,

6 that Justice Breyer brought up. Let's say you have

7 three -- three acres of wetlands and you own a hundred

8 acres. You say, well, my property is these three acres

9 and you've taken it all. The law is you don't get --

10 Mr. Groen doesn't get to define property interests that

11 way because it's gaming the system by saying this is

12 what it is.

13 Now, another one of my colleagues pointed

14 out, there are two halves of the State law here: Half

15 of it is the lot line, half of it is the merger. And

16 you want to say, well, for takings purposes, all we look

17 at is -- is the merger. And it seems to me that that's

18 just the flip side of what the landowner can't do. You

19 can't sort of preempt the takings analysis by saying

20 we're only going to look at this aspect under which, of

21 course, we win. Just like the property owner says we're

22 only going to look at these three -- three acres under

23 which, of course, we win.

24 MR. TSEYTLIN: No, Your Honor. I want to be

25 even more specific. What I meant by "all relevant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 purposes," I mean for all purposes under State law.

33

2 If tomorrow someone went to the county

3 register and deeds and deleted the lot line between

4 Lot E and F, there is not a single right that the Murrs

5 have under State law that they would lose, and there's

6 not a single right they would gain.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the --

8 MR. TSEYTLIN: The key point is --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the key point is

10 they didn't do that. Nobody did that. And I'm looking

11 at page G -- 3 of the appendix to the County's brief,

12 and that's the basis on which the analysis was done.

13 And it says they did not decide whether lots have been

14 formally merged. And it's language that is used

15 throughout. These were effectively merged.

16 Well, I mean, on the other side of it, they

17 can argue, well, we effectively drew lines around these

18 three acres. And it seems to me that -- that there's a

19 confusion between the definition of "property" and the

20 question of whether or not there's a takings. And if

21 you start analyzing with the takings factors and the way

22 there's property, that muddles the whole analysis.

23 MR. TSEYTLIN: Well, Your Honor, let me

24 explain the State's methodology. And I think in doing

25 that, I think I'll be able to answer your question more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 clearly.

34

2 The test to identify the relevant parcel in

3 the State's submission should be one straightforward

4 question: Is the land lot at issue completely separate

5 from any other land under State law? And there, you

6 look at all of State law. And where the State law --

7 lot line has no meaning for anyone, it has -- it does

8 not give any rights, which is the case here.

9 JUSTICE ALITO: So if lots are contiguous,

10 that's the end of the question for you; right?

11 MR. TSEYTLIN: Not at all, Your Honor. Our

12 test is if two lots have a link, a legal link under

13 State law, then they are one parcel. If they have no

14 legal link under State law, then they are completely

15 separate.

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you -- you're

17 talking just about State law. It seems to me that your

18 position is as wooden and as vulnerable a criticism

19 as -- as the Petitioner's. You say, whatever State

20 law -- basically you're saying, whatever State law does,

21 that defines the property. But you have to look at the

22 reasonable investment-backed expectations of the owner.

23 MR. TSEYTLIN: Right, Your Honor. And I

24 want to clarify that what we're talking about here is

25 just the threshold question. And after the threshold

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 question is determined, the reasonable expectations

35

2 will, in the vast majority of cases, be analyzed as part

3 of the Penn Central analysis. The approach urged by the

4 Federal government, the county, and in the rebuttal --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the reasonable

6 investment-backed expectation was based on the fact that

7 you had a lot-line rule which you've now changed. So

8 you say that the State law can change reasonable

9 investment-backed expectations.

10 MR. TSEYTLIN: Your Honor, I want to be

11 clear. When you're doing the second step, the hard work

12 of the takings analysis, the existence -- the

13 preexistence of the lot lines, what the

14 investment-backed expectations were can all be taken

15 into account. The problem with the approach urged by

16 the county, the Federal government, and my friends in

17 saying it's a reasonable presumption is you basically

18 have Penn Central squared. I --

19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you this

20 example. A -- it's not that far from this case. A

21 plumber and his wife buy a small lot, but it's a lot on

22 which you can build houses at that time, and they build

23 a modest house.

24 MR. TSEYTLIN: Uh-huh.

25 JUSTICE ALITO: And they say, you know,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 we're going to -- there's a lot next door, let's buy

36

2 that; we can use it as a yard for our children when

3 they're growing up. And then after they're grown, we

4 can sell it, and we'll have some money for retirement.

5 And that's a buildable lot at that time.

6 And then this new regulation is adopted and

7 now the side lot can't be sold at all. And they say:

8 Well, look, you've taken away this valuable asset we

9 were going to use for our retirement.

10 And the answer is: Well, no, because you

11 could -- you could sell your whole property, and

12 somebody who wants to build a big house could build on

13 that property.

14 And they say: Well, that's fine, but we

15 like our little house. We'd like to stay in our little

16 house.

17 Now, what is fair about that situation?

18 MR. TSEYTLIN: Your Honor, I want to

19 clarify. I believe that in your hypothetical, when you

20 had two lots that were preexisting and owned by the same

21 person and then they were involuntarily merged by

22 government action, the analysis would, in fact, be on

23 each lot separately. It is completely different --

24 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you mean by they

25 were "involuntarily merged by government action"?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 MR. TSEYTLIN: That is, there was a -- they 2 had two lots. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: Right. 4 MR. TSEYTLIN: Same person had two lots. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: Right. 6 MR. TSEYTLIN: They were each completely 7 independent under State law. A new State law comes in 8 and says those are merged. That is a completely 9 different analysis, and I would agree with Your Honor's 10 premise that -11 JUSTICE ALITO: That wouldn't fall under 12 your regulation? 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yeah. Well, isn't that 14 this case? 15 MR. TSEYTLIN: No, Your Honor. The -- the 16 fundamental difference in this case is that the merger 17 happened by voluntary action of the plaintiffs. And 18 what the plaintiffs did when they acquired two 19 contiguous substandard lots is -20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's by voluntary 21 action as defined by State law. The State law takes 22 that voluntary action. And it's the State law that 23 makes the consequence, and that's the consequence we're 24 talking about. 25 MR. TSEYTLIN: Well, Your Honor, I think the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 questions that Justice Kagan was asking clarified this 2 point. That is to say, if you want to, in this case, 3 talk about what this regulation did in 1976, is it put a 4 conditional stair restriction on the parents who owned 5 Lot E. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: And that's a very fine 7 argument, except for the fact that it's completely 8 contrary to the reasoning in Palazzolo. Justice 9 Kennedy's opinion in Palazzolo rejects that. And the 10 debate between Justice O'Connor in concurrence and 11 Justice Scalia in concurrence is about exactly that. 12 And you don't even cite Palazzolo in your brief, do you? 13 MR. TSEYTLIN: That is not correct. At 14 pages 41 through 43, we discuss why this is not a 15 Palazzolo-type claim. A Palazzolo-type claim, as 16 Justice Kagan's questions indicated, would be that 17 something happened in 1976 that was unreasonable. And 18 by "unreasonable," I mean that it took property without 19 just compensation. So there would have to be a look 20 back to 1976 to see if the relevant takings test fails. 21 And it wouldn't fail here, because what 22 happened in 1976? The parents owned Lot E only. The -23 and their interest to Lot E was protected by the 24 grandfather clause. The only additional restriction 25 upon the parents that was placed in 1976 by the State
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 was a conditional sale restriction. That is, you can do 2 anything with the lot you want. You can sell to whoever 3 you want. The only thing you can't do practically is 4 sell it to someone who only wants to buy it if they also 5 own a lot next door and also is substandard. That is a 6 conditional sale restriction, a very minor restriction. 7 And as we pointed out in pages 41 through 43 of our 8 brief, they have not brought that kind of claim, which 9 takes them out of the world of Palazzolo. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, which -11 MR. TSEYTLIN: Go ahead. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: If -- if one lot is owned by 13 a wholly owned corporation or an LLC and the other is 14 owned by the owner in the owner's own name, are they 15 considered to be under common ownership under Wisconsin 16 law? 17 MR. TSEYTLIN: No, Your Honor. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: No. 19 MR. TSEYTLIN: Unless you can pierce the 20 corporate veil, which is obviously a very high standard. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: What -- what about -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the same with 23 husband -- husband owns one lot, wife owns the other; 24 they're different? 25 MR. TSEYTLIN: The State hasn't taken a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 final position on that. My understanding is the county, 2 which is the first-line enforcer of this, would 3 interpret it that way. 4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would interpret it what 5 way? 6 MR. TSEYTLIN: Interpret it that if they're 7 not literally the same person, even if it's husband and 8 wife, even if it's two people and one of them owns one 9 and one of them owns the other, and it's not the same 10 two people and they were -11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I correct you -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I didn't 13 hear the end of your sentence. 14 MR. TSEYTLIN: That is my understanding of 15 the county's interpretation. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is? That 17 it -- that it's still treated separately? 18 MR. TSEYTLIN: That if two owns the exact -19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that makes it 20 seem we're talking about it in justice and fairness. 21 That seems to make it seem a little quirky that these 22 owners are not entitled to treat them separately, while 23 if they -- they just happen to record them in -- in 24 separate names that they would be a entirely different 25 situation.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 MR. TSEYTLIN: Well, let me explain what the 2 State is trying to achieve in this law. It wants to 3 ultimately phase out substandard lots in the long term. 4 It does not want to interfere with any current 5 investment-backed expectations. So what it says is 6 we're going to have a slow phaseout and it's going to be 7 only triggered by the situation where people end up 8 taking the lots in common ownership. And that will 9 happen in the long term. 10 Most people in this area bring lots into 11 common ownership on purpose. And why would they do 12 that? Because if -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they won't 14 after today, I mean -- or if you win. 15 (Laughter.) 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You'll be -- you'll 17 be smart enough to say: Okay. Husband, you own F; I 18 will own E. And by the way, you're my successor in 19 interest under E, and I'm your successor in interest 20 under F. And -- and then we'll be fine. 21 MR. TSEYTLIN: Well -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it really -23 does the whole takings issue really turn on that? 24 MR. TSEYTLIN: Yes, Your Honor. Let me tell 25 you why we do think it'll be effective. Because most
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 people bring these lots under common ownership

42

2 purposefully. And the reason they do that is they want

3 to build a single house up on a bluff, a bigger house.

4 So the reason -- and we think that that will happen over

5 time. It's already happened with eight property owners

6 in this area. So while it is a slow phaseout of lots,

7 it is a perfectly sensible regime. It balances, on one

8 hand, the desire to protect investment settle -- back --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would

10 suppose that in my hypothetical, the husband owner on

11 one side and the wife owner on the other side, they can

12 build a common house on the two lots, can't they?

13 MR. TSEYTLIN: The -- the merger of the two

14 lots are bringing into common ownership makes it easier

15 to apply -- comply with other regulatory restrictions on

16 the area about minimum lot size and things of that sort.

17 If you don't bring them into common ownership, then

18 you're -- you're left with the nonconforming structure

19 that's on your nonconforming lot.

20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: May -- may I have one

21 question? It's a background question.

22 Suppose these people had Lots E and F

23 merged. Then they bought G and H. Can they still build

24 one house, just one?

25 MR. TSEYTLIN: It would depend on the size

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 of G and H, how much net project area. Right now,

43

2 there's --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose

4 they're just like these lots.

5 MR. TSEYTLIN: Well, Your Honor, so right

6 now, it's about .9 --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they have E and F, then

8 they buy G and H, can they build only one house, or two?

9 MR. TSEYTLIN: Right, Your Honor, just --

10 just let me have two seconds. I think I can answer the

11 question.

12 Right now, it's .98 net project area. If

13 Lot G is more than .2 net project area, they can build

14 one house. And then the new lot gets the new net

15 project area. So, basically, in order to have two

16 buildable lots, you have to add up to more than two

17 acres of net project area.

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: General --

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It makes no

20 difference under your approach that the two lots were

21 taxed separately, does it?

22 MR. TSEYTLIN: No, Your Honor. I --

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that doesn't make

24 it. It makes no difference under your approach that

25 there were lot lines separating the two lots; right?

44 1 MR. TSEYTLIN: That's right, Your Honor. 2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there other 3 aspects in which the two lots are treated separately 4 that make no difference under your approach? 5 MR. TSEYTLIN: So with regard to the tax 6 assessor, that was an -- that was an error that the tax 7 assessor made. In fact, that fact milked it strongly in 8 favor of the -- the rule that we urge. Because in our 9 rule, you look at only State law and you look at whether 10 the lots are actually separate under State law. 11 Under the all things considered approach -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are these lots 13 actually separate under State law? 14 MR. TSEYTLIN: There is no legal situation 15 in which the lot line between Lot E and Lot F makes any 16 difference right now, none. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so that's not 18 quite an answer. Are they legally separate under State 19 law? They're still shown on the plat as separate lots, 20 correct? 21 MR. TSEYTLIN: That -- that's correct, Your 22 Honor. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So to what extent is 24 it wrong for me to understand that the only -- the only 25 sense in which the merger doctrine that you're talking
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 about applies is with respect to a takings claim?

45

2 MR. TSEYTLIN: No, Your Honor. They -- it's

3 with regard to every possible use or sale of these lots.

4 Any development, any sale, anything else a person in the

5 real world would want to do, there would be no

6 difference. There's not a single action that someone

7 could take that they couldn't take if the lot line was

8 deleted. It makes no difference. The -- the lot line

9 between Lot E and Lot F as it currently stands --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then so there's

11 no reason -- under State law, there is a procedure to

12 eliminate the lot lines, and you're saying that that

13 procedure is irrelevant in this case?

14 MR. TSEYTLIN: Given the specific facts of

15 this case it would be completely irrelevant. No one

16 would go through that process because it would not add

17 or subtract any single right to the Murrs if they --

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: General --

19 MR. TSEYTLIN: -- deleted that lot line.

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: May I ask a question. The

21 difference between you and the other folks on that side

22 of the room is that they want to look at reasonable

23 expectations, and State law, in part, defines those

24 reasonable expectations, but they're allowing for the

25 idea that other things might come in as well, and you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 saying it's all and only State law.

46

2 Now, I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea that

3 preexisting State law really does influence quite a bit

4 your expectations about what property you own and what

5 you can do with it. But still, what's the harm of doing

6 what the government and the county want rather than what

7 you want in terms of saying the analysis should be a

8 little bit more fluent, fluid, sure, State law matters,

9 but maybe other the things matter too in a particular

10 situation.

11 MR. TSEYTLIN: Because what you get with any

12 of their approaches is Penn Central squared. That is to

13 say, you have a complex multifactor analysis, basically

14 an all-things-considered analysis at step one, just to

15 figure out the parcel. And then, in the vast majority

16 of cases, you then do a complex multifactor analysis and

17 you -- which is going to look at a lot of the same

18 factors.

19 I think one area of agreement among the

20 parties and amicus briefs in this case is this is --

21 area of law is incredibly complicated. It's difficult

22 to make your way through the weeds. It --

23 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it matter to you if it

24 were not possible to build a house that bridged the two

25 lots? Suppose one was at the bottom -- one lot is at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
47 1 the bottom of a cliff and the other is at the top of a 2 cliff. Would that matter to you? 3 MR. TSEYTLIN: In defining what the relevant 4 parcel is it would not. It would matter quite a bit in 5 doing the hard work of doing the Penn Central analysis, 6 and that's one of the key points I'd like to 7 reemphasize. 8 We believe -- may I finish my sentence? 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 10 MR. TSEYTLIN: We believe that most of the 11 work under takings law should be done at that second 12 step, usually Penn Central. 13 We believe the first step, the parcel 14 question, should be determined in a straightforward way 15 so the Court can move on to doing the hard work of Penn 16 Central. 17 Thank you, Your Honors. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 Mr. Lazarus. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS 21 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT ST. CROIX COUNTY 22 MR. LAZARUS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 23 please the Court: 24 Just like cities and counties in at least 33 25 States have done for decades, for more than 40 years,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 St. Croix County has excluded from its grandfather

48

2 clause for preexisting lots commonly owned substandard

3 adjacent lots. During all those decades, no court at

4 any time in any jurisdiction in the United States has

5 held that exclusion amounts to a taking and for good

6 reason: It's fair and it's just. And the same

7 reason --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's -- and

9 it gets to the questions I was asking early, fairness

10 and justness.

11 But the -- and if -- actually the -- the

12 point is -- last made by -- by your friend, there are

13 two different questions. What is property and whether

14 there's been a taking. And I thought the question of

15 fairness and justice is justice is applied to the second

16 question. I didn't think it was applied to defining

17 what the property was because then you really do get, as

18 he said, Penn Central squared.

19 You're looking at fairness and justice. How

20 should we define this property? Well, fairness and

21 justice for what purpose? Well, for the Takings Clause.

22 And then once you define it, then you say well, it's

23 fairness and justice for whether there's been a taking.

24 It seems to me that you're just kind of

25 teeing up the definition of property to give you the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 right answer under the Takings Clause.

49

2 MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, in -- in this

3 case, in Valley, there is some circularity here, but let

4 me tell you why there is some circularity here.

5 And that is because they're making and

6 taking the challenge to a very odd -- a very odd topic,

7 and that is the absence of an exclusion. And -- and the

8 reason why there's no exclusion for these kinds of

9 substandard commonly adjacent lots is precisely because

10 government has determined over decades that, in this

11 situation, the economic impact isn't so great. There

12 isn't so hardship.

13 So the premise of the -- of these ordinances

14 is the absence of hardship. And since the purpose of

15 the Penn Central analysis or the Lucas analysis for

16 economic impact is to identify when the hardship really

17 is so great to justify the payment of just compensation,

18 it's not surprising that the very teachings of these

19 ordinances is directly relevant to how you evaluate the

20 property.

21 JUSTICE ALITO: How can you say that the

22 impact is not -- is categorically not great? If some --

23 somebody buys a lot next to that person's house with the

24 expectation of selling it at some point in the future to

25 meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
50 1 regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can't 2 sell it, that there's no hardship there? 3 MR. LAZARUS: The -- the hardship -- the 4 question though is how do you define the extent of the 5 hardship. And what you want -- what you need to look at 6 under the Penn Central analysis is what the economic 7 impact is, and to define the parcel part of that is 8 to -- to identify what the impact is. 9 In -- for instance, in this case, the 10 economic impact on the Murrs, right, has to take into 11 account the shared value of the two because the fact is, 12 if you look to what -- there is no general issue of 13 material fact with the lower courts on this question. 14 The value of the two parcels together for one house is 15 $698,000. The value of two houses separate, with a 16 house on each, is $771,000. 17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's fine except 18 that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put 19 together, they would have to move away. 20 MR. LAZARUS: Right. But -- and -- and 21 the -- and they -22 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, they think that's 23 irrelevant. 24 MR. LAZARUS: The takings inquiry is what 25 the economic impact is on them. It shouldn't be a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 different test depending upon their particular

51

2 subjective preferences, then someone else's subjective

3 preferences. The -- the fact is --

4 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought the -- I thought

5 that what you're saying is we have to look at what's

6 fair and just, and now you say, well, we disregard the

7 situation of -- of the particular people who are

8 involved.

9 MR. LAZARUS: Well, no. You're looking

10 at -- it's several things. You're looking at first what

11 the economic impact is. Define the parcel in a way

12 which actually evaluates the real impact. Not a

13 fictional impact, but the real impact. The real impact

14 here is very little.

15 You're also taking account the -- the State

16 law. You're looking at the law at the time to figure

17 out what the reasonable expectations are of people.

18 You're taking that into account as well.

19 The other thing you're taking into account,

20 Your Honor, is the point you mentioned before.

21 Contiguousness by itself wouldn't be enough. We aren't

22 arguing that. One thing you look at is the State law

23 for expectations.

24 You also look at the physical and geographic

25 characteristics of the property; in other words, to find

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
52 1 out whether there was any real potential here for unity 2 of use and integrative use. For instance, in this case, 3 if Lot E and F were different and you had one up above 4 and one down below, that might well be a harder case to 5 suggest that there was that kind of unity of use, 6 integrated. 7 And you look at those three things, because 8 what you're trying to look for to evaluate the parcel is 9 you're trying to see what the real burden is that people 10 are suffering in the case. 11 You know, it's a remarkable finding that 12 there's such a little difference in value between one 13 house on two and two houses each on one. And the -- and 14 the reason for that, there's actually a formal term in 15 economics for it. It's called the complementarity 16 principle. You don't need to know that term. It's just 17 common sense. 18 There's some kinds of property, land is one 19 of them, that can create value joined that doesn't exist 20 when separate. The most extreme example are shoes. No 21 one would pay very much for just a right shoe or a left 22 shoe, but they pay a fair amount for the two shoes 23 together. Land is not an extreme example like shoes, 24 but the same phenomenon exists -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
53 1 you're -- you're trying to figure out then what the land 2 interest is. And usually there's a regular way to do 3 that, which is you go down to the county office and you 4 look at what the -- the lines are between your property 5 and somebody else's or your lot and a different lot. 6 You don't look to whether one is below and one is above, 7 or that, and it seems to me that gets into a very 8 complicated situation when for Federal takings purposes 9 you're redefining what State law says property is. 10 MR. LAZARUS: What -- what you're doing -11 what you're doing, Your Honor, is you're trying to 12 determine the economic impact. There's no question 13 State law defines what you own, but the question of 14 whether it's a taking -- it's a question of Federal 15 constitutional law, and the economic impact inquiry has 16 to see to what extent there really is this incredibly 17 disproportionate burden they're facing or not. 18 In -- in the Penn -- in the Penn -- oh 19 sorry. In the Penn Central case, in the Keystone 20 Bituminous case, every one of those cases State law 21 defined as separate property interests, things can be 22 bought and sold, the air rights can be bought and sold, 23 the support estate can be bought and sold, real estate 24 can be bought and sold under State law. There are 25 distinct property rights under State law, and the Court
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
54 1 nonetheless, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, 2 joined them together because the Court wanted to find 3 out whether, in fact, there was that kind of economic 4 burden. And they even did it in cases involving lot 5 lines. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about adding 7 here when I look to see the reasonableness of the 8 regulation. I mean, suppose in Holmes' case, the 9 regulation had said you have to leave columns of a 10 thousand feet of coal. But every expert said, or 11 everyone who knew about it, said you don't need more 12 than 50 feet. 13 MR. LAZARUS: Well, certainly it's true, the 14 ultimate analysis, you pay attention to reasonableness. 15 You -- you pay attention to whether the government -16 you don't get to accept the government saying it doesn't 17 automatically qualify -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Does that fit in your 19 three? 20 MR. LAZARUS: Absolutely, Your Honor. It 21 fits under Penn Central. And in this case -- in this 22 case, this is really the easy case. It's almost a sui 23 generis case because the -- the State law at issue was 24 one which -- which is premised on the notion that under 25 this circumstance you actually don't face such a great
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 hardship. That's exactly why they don't get the

55

2 exemption.

3 This isn't -- they are not challenging

4 restriction. They're actually challenging not getting

5 exemption which someone else is getting. And the reason

6 they're not getting that exemption is they don't have

7 the same hardship that other people have.

8 The -- the owner of the isolated lot,

9 substandard lot, asks for some kind of exemption. They

10 face the prospect of a complete economic wipeout. But

11 the owner of two substandard adjacent lots, they don't.

12 That person, like the Murrs, they have development

13 options.

14 In addition, they have the opportunity, as I

15 said before, to created value, value that doesn't exist

16 separate. And in this case, the value of joining the

17 property together, the reason why this property -- which

18 is beautiful property, stunningly beautiful, St. Croix

19 River, at the bend of the river. The reason why it's so

20 valuable is two things: River frontage and privacy.

21 That's the touchstone of value here.

22 Lot F is only 58 feet wide at the bottom,

23 the distance between the two columns in this room, and

24 right next to a public area. Lot E has a hundred feet,

25 twice that, of river frontage. And off to the west,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
56 1 more privacy. When you add those two lots together, the 2 value of this luxury lot at the bend of the river is so 3 great, it actually almost overcomes the loss of value of 4 not having the second home on the lot. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I've had a 6 problem with the appraisal figures, and it may be a step 7 I'm missing. 8 Why would anybody pay $400,000 for a lot 9 they can't build on? 10 MR. LAZARUS: Because -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The two values -- your 12 example said the two lots put together are less 13 valuable, or more valuable? 14 MR. LAZARUS: Just a little less valuable. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yeah. I know there's 16 only a ten percent difference. But as I understood the 17 appraisal figures, and are now using estimates, each lot 18 was worth about 350 and 400,000 separately, for a value 19 of 750. Together they were valued at 680. So they 20 weren't -- you didn't double the price -21 MR. LAZARUS: No. But what you do -- if -22 you didn't lose very much. By not being able to build a 23 second home, the value doesn't sort of halve. Instead, 24 the value goes only by -- down by nine percent. And the 25 reason is that the combined lot is this luxury lot.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 This is a high-end area --

57

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand why the

3 combination, but why would anybody buy the lot you can't

4 develop on?

5 MR. LAZARUS: Well, the question is not

6 the -- what the value of Lot E as a unit that you can't

7 develop or -- or build on. The question is what the

8 value of Lot E is to the Murrs, who also own Lot F,

9 because that's how you define what the burden is to

10 them. And the burden to them -- if -- if someone only

11 owned Lot E, then the hardship exemption would apply and

12 they could build. That's exactly the distinction that

13 the ordinance draws between the two.

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? Just say

15 yes or no, and if it's wrong, I'll figure it out later.

16 (Laughter.)

17 JUSTICE BREYER: Are you saying -- look, of

18 course you look at the lines that the State draws, but

19 that isn't determinative because you want to know the

20 total impact on the person, which may get you to look at

21 nearby property or other things. You want to know how

22 reasonable this regulation that affects it is; you want

23 to know whether he knew when he bought it, and perhaps

24 there are others.

25 Is that basically what you're saying?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
58 1 You're not denying that you look at the State's lines. 2 It's just that they are not determinative? 3 MR. LAZARUS: Mr. Chief Justice, may I 4 answer the question? 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He wanted one word. 6 MR. LAZARUS: Yes. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. LAZARUS: Yes. Yes. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 10 Ms. Prelogar. 11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR 12 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 13 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 14 MS. PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 15 please the Court: 16 I'd like to begin with your question, 17 Mr. Chief Justice, about why it wouldn't be sensible to 18 just look at lot lines here as the starting point for 19 defining the parcel as a whole. 20 And as Justice Breyer just noted, we think 21 the lot lines are certainly relevant, especially insofar 22 as they might shape reasonable expectations about how 23 property owners expect to use their property and what 24 they expect to remain separate and distinct. But we 25 urge this Court not to adopt a presumption or a bright
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
59 1 line rule that focuses on lot lines in isolation. And 2 we really see two principal problems with that, one of 3 which is practical, and the other is legal. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry. 5 Go ahead. 6 MS. PRELOGAR: Turning to the practical 7 point first, especially when you're looking at 8 contiguous commonly-owned property, which is the 9 situation the Court is confronting here. We think that 10 lot lines will frequently not be an accurate indicator 11 of how that claimant is being burdened by the particular 12 regulation, and that's because when you have those 13 contiguous commonly-owned lots, there's a physical unity 14 that frequently opens up the potential for linked use, 15 linked development, a direct reciprocity of advantage, 16 and shared value. 17 And so when thinking about how to address 18 the parcel as a whole issue, where the whole purpose, 19 the whole point is to get a feel for how the regulation 20 is actually impacting this claimant, focusing on lot 21 lines would exclude relevant considerations about the 22 on-the-ground economic realities. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's -- I just 24 don't know how that works with -- with property. Not 25 asking whether there's a takings, but asking whether
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 there's property.

60

2 You say it -- it depends on spacial,

3 functional, and what's the third thing?

4 MS. PRELOGAR: Temporal.

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Temporal

6 considerations.

7 Now, you usually don't say that when you're

8 asking about property. You say, I owned Lot E or I own

9 Lot F, and here it is on the map; that's what I own.

10 You don't sit down and say: Well, but with spacial

11 considerations I own this much of it, and when temporal

12 considerations, add this, and functional that.

13 It seems to me that those concerns are

14 pertinent at considering whether there's a taking of the

15 property. But when it comes to what the property is,

16 that's a whole different question, and you don't get

17 into spacial, you get into what the plat looks like in

18 the county office.

19 MS. PRELOGAR: I think it's absolutely the

20 case that for terms -- in terms of defining what's a

21 protected property interest, at the outset you look to

22 State law, you look to lot lines, and no one's

23 contesting here that there's a protected property

24 interest. But we think that this relevant parcel

25 determination does come into the second part of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 inquiry in terms of whether there's been a taking.

61

2 It's about how do you get a feel for the --

3 the relevant unit of property that's at issue to

4 determine how this regulation is actually affecting this

5 claimant, and so we would put those considerations on

6 the taking side of the line.

7 This Court has always shown a preference in

8 deciding, as Justice Breyer said, and -- and Justice

9 Holmes' famous formulation whether a regulation goes too

10 far, the Court's always shown a preference for being

11 able to engage in that kind of contextual analysis that

12 focuses on all of the relevant facts and circumstances.

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem I have with

14 your test, which has the -- the three components, is I

15 don't actually see anywhere in there any weight given to

16 the State property lines.

17 MS. PRELOGAR: Well --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't explicitly

19 list it among those three items. You don't tell us how

20 you're weighing it or not weighing it, what presumptions

21 you're giving it or not. So where does it fit in to

22 your -- your -- your three factors?

23 MS. PRELOGAR: We think that it frequently

24 goes to the functional considerations because it shapes

25 expectations about how land can properly be used,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
62 1 whether it's an entirely separate and distinct issue. 2 So we do think that there's a role for State law to 3 play. And here we think, actually, that's one of the -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we think there should 5 be more of a role, where would you put it? St. Croix 6 puts it on the second prong. Where would you end up 7 putting it, and why do you disagree with how they use 8 it? 9 MS. PRELOGAR: I think it's very important 10 not to adopt any kind of presumption or bright line rule 11 for the relevant parcel. And so I also would put it on 12 the second prong of conducting the Penn Central 13 analysis. 14 But the reason for that is because the 15 relevant parcel that the threshold definitional question 16 is going to provide the touchstone that contextualizes 17 the whole rest of the takings inquiry. And if the Court 18 were to artificially narrow it and look only at lot 19 lines, or to presumptive weight to those lot lines, then 20 that's going to be the focal point for measuring 21 economic impact for looking at investment-backed 22 expectations. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose you have lots that 24 are not contiguous but they're very close to each other. 25 Now, under your flexible approach with all these
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 different dimensions, are they ruled out as a single

63

2 parcel?

3 MS. PRELOGAR: I think it would be very

4 difficult to say that those kinds of noncontiguous

5 properties function as an integrated economic unit. So

6 I think it would be the rare case where it would be

7 appropriate to aggregate those property interests. But

8 I think that it is important to keep in mind that there

9 are so many different ways that property interests

10 arise, that it is important to have a flexible, nuanced

11 approach here.

12 And Justice Alito, I would just point to the

13 example we raised about the large developer who acquires

14 a large tract, maybe a thousand acres of property, and

15 subdivides it into hundreds --

16 JUSTICE ALITO: That can easily be taken

17 care of by making the rule look to the -- the lots as

18 defined at the time of the acquisition rather than

19 something that was done prior to -- prior to the time

20 when -- when a rule would be -- would be applied. But,

21 you know, it's fine to say that there are all these

22 dimensions and they should be nuanced and who can be

23 opposed to something that's nuanced. But what are we

24 looking for? What are we looking for? We're looking at

25 all these dimensions to determine what? Could you just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
64 1 say as precisely as you can what we would -- we should 2 be looking for in defining what is the property that is 3 taken using all of the different dimensions that are 4 relevant in your view? 5 MS. PRELOGAR: I think the clearest 6 articulation I have is to say that you should be looking 7 for what in the interest of fairness and justice is an 8 accurate way to measure economic impact. And that's the 9 point of the relevant parcel determination. It's 10 focused specifically on the economic impact prong of the 11 equation. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: And is it the economic 13 impact on these particular owners or on some category of 14 hypothetical owners? 15 MS. PRELOGAR: It's always been an 16 individualized inquiry focused on these particular 17 owners. And I think that the facts of this case well 18 illustrate the point that when you're conducting that 19 kind of evaluation, it's often the case, as -- as 20 Mr. Lazarus said, that you're going to have a shared 21 value, a reciprocal value that -22 JUSTICE ALITO: But what if a lot -- but 23 what if a lot was -- was preserved? What if it was 24 bought for the purpose of selling it at some point in 25 the future and/or it was preserved for that purpose so
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
65 1 that nothing was built on it so that it could readily be 2 sold? 3 MS. PRELOGAR: I think that those kinds of 4 reasonable investment-backed expectations have a role to 5 play, but I don't think that they can be dispositive. 6 Because, again, the point of the relevant parcel 7 determination is to accurately gauge economic impact. 8 But I do think that it's important -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why wouldn't they be 10 determinative? I thought you said it was we look to 11 legitimate expectations. There, their expectations are 12 completely frustrated. 13 MS. PRELOGAR: It's certainly the case that 14 anytime anyone's alleging a regulatory taking, the 15 premise of the claim is that they're being prevented 16 from doing something with their property that they 17 wanted to do with it. We think that that's not 18 sufficient to alone define the relevant parcel because 19 it might be the case, as it is here, that there's 20 actually not much of an economic impact at all. 21 And if that's the case, then this isn't the 22 kind of regulation that is requiring someone to shoulder 23 a burden that in the interest of fairness and justice 24 should be -25 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that comes back to

66 1 my -- but -- but you're saying that they have to move. 2 They can't afford to build a big house here, which is 3 what everybody wants. They don't want these little 4 modest houses anymore. They want McMansions. They -5 they have to move. That's what you're saying. 6 MS. PRELOGAR: But to the extent that a 7 court were to conclude that that is an undue 8 interference with their investment-backed expectations 9 or that the character of that government action is 10 actually unjust and anomalus, then I think that this 11 Court's precedent already builds in sufficient 12 protection for those kinds of interest without trying to 13 rely solely on expectations to identify the relevant 14 parcel. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- but I thought 16 reasonable investment-backed expectations were 17 objective. You're now making them subjective. 18 MS. PRELOGAR: Oh, no. To be clear, Justice 19 Kennedy, we do think that it has to be an objective 20 inquiry. And I understood Justice Alito to be focusing 21 on a fact pattern where the property was acquired before 22 the relevant regulatory restriction was enacted and 23 thereby frustrated the expectations. 24 Here, we think it's actually a critical fact 25 that Petitioners voluntarily brought this land under

67 1 common ownership and so triggered the application of the 2 merger provision decades after the relevant regulatory 3 restriction was in place. And that does weaken the idea 4 that there were any objectively reasonable 5 expectations -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I actually think 7 they did it -- the parents did it after the ordinance's, 8 from my timeline, creation. The ordinance was passed in 9 1976. And in 1982, the parents took the property under 10 common ownership from the Atlantic Plumbing Company. 11 MS. PRELOGAR: That's correct. So that 12 there -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So neither the parents 14 or the children, if they had been paying attention to 15 the regulatory scheme, had a reasonable expectation that 16 the ordinance wouldn't affect them. 17 MS. PRELOGAR: That's exactly correct. We 18 think that the timing here of the relevant transfers of 19 property reinforces the idea that it's proper to view 20 these two parcels together as an integrated whole. 21 And the other facts that I would add to that 22 are the spatial ones, the fact that these are contiguous 23 commonly owned tracts with possibilities for linked 24 development and linked uses that creates that direct 25 shared value that is borne out by the valuation evidence

68 1 in this case. Because it is significant here that if 2 you view these lots together as an effectively merged 3 parcel, as they are under State law, then the value is 4 only 10 percent less than the value of two separate lots 5 with two separate building sites. And -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But by saying 7 "effectively merged," you mean not really merged? 8 MS. PRELOGAR: Absolutely. We're not 9 suggesting that the lot lines have been erased here. 10 And so we do think that those lot lines continue to have 11 a role to play. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except with respect 13 to takings. 14 MS. PRELOGAR: No. We think that they do 15 have a role to play with respect to takings, but that 16 it's also important to conduct the same kind of 17 contextual analysis that's been the hallmark of this 18 Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 Mr. Groen, you have four minutes remaining. 21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. GROEN 22 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 23 MR. GROEN: Thank you. 24 Beginning with the multifactor nuanced 25 approach, the reason why that kind of approach to

Official - Subject to Final Review
69 1 defining the property interest -- remember, the first 2 issue, you have to define the property interest that is 3 the subject of the takings -- of the takings claim. The 4 reason is because the whole real estate industry, from 5 mortgage lenders to property owners to title insurance 6 companies, all rely upon the geographic boundaries. And 7 it's exactly as was suggested -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: With the regulations 9 that affect those boundaries. 10 MR. GROEN: I'm sorry? 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: With the regulations 12 that affect those boundaries. Whether it's a title 13 company or anyone else -14 MR. GROEN: But we -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- they look at what the 16 paper talks about as a property line and what 17 regulations do with respect to that line. 18 MR. GROEN: And when the regulations 19 redefine and impose a new definition, the reliance that 20 previously existed is undermined. And that is the 21 gravamen of the takings claim. It is not a redefinition 22 that absolves liability. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do we do -24 MR. GROEN: It's a redefinition -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with the fact as I see
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
70 1 it that these properties were bought separately, one by 2 the parents, the other by their company, and that post 3 regulations, knowing exactly what they were doing -- and 4 you say they didn't, but that has to do with their 5 choice, because you buy everything subject to 6 regulation. You may not choose to look at it, but 7 you -- you should. Ignorance of the law is not a 8 defense anywhere. I don't know why it should be in the 9 regulatory context. 10 But putting that aside, they took the title 11 to the property in their own names post regulation. 12 MR. GROEN: Yes, they did. This is a normal 13 American family who understands when you buy property 14 and you have a deed and it's zoned for residential use 15 in a subdivision, you get to use it. And you get to 16 pass it on to your kids. 17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you get to use 18 everything you own with -- subject to regulatory 19 requirements. 20 MR. GROEN: That's right. 21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I buy a piece of 22 property 10 years ago or 20 years ago, and I didn't know 23 I had to put a sprinkler system in. Today, if you want 24 to do any kind of renovation, you got to put one in. 25 MR. GROEN: But --

71 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's lots of 2 regulations that you didn't buy expecting -3 MR. GROEN: That's right. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but they do affect 5 you. 6 MR. GROEN: But the Murrs bought two 7 separate parcels that comprised two separate building 8 lots, and that has now -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They -10 MR. GROEN: -- been taken -11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They -12 MR. GROEN: -- away from them. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They didn't buy them. 14 MR. GROEN: That -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They got them in 1982 16 subject to knowing that they could only develop on one. 17 MR. GROEN: Well, that circles right back to 18 the Palazzolo argument that we discussed earlier. 19 The other issue I'd like to address is this 20 reliance that -- that I -- that we're just talking about 21 with subdivisions and deeds, that is a system that all 22 of this country relies upon. And if we're going to 23 undermine that, that is a serious step in taking away 24 rights and property that people traditionally understand 25 and use in their daily lives. That's the protection

1 that's talked about in Roth v. Board of Regents.

2 The second thing is this valuation question.

3 And couple of points on that. All the discussion about,

4 well, the property is valuable because it's waterfront,

5 all of that discussion goes to the merits of the takings

6 claim; in other words, how much economic impact is

7 there? The first step is to define the relevant unit of

8 property for analysis. And that step is looking at the

9 deeds and the -- the geographic boundaries of Lot E.

10 That is the presumption.

11 When you turn to the valuation question, the

12 notion that Lot -- the combined Lot E-F has value

13 because it's waterfront, that is ignoring the

14 fundamental aspects that the valuation in a residential

15 lot is because you can build on it. And that is what

16 has been taken from the Murrs. They previously had two

17 building sites; now they have one.

18 The valuation that the county discusses, the

19 value is not attributed to Lot E, because Lot F has the

20 building site. So, really, the county is getting a

21 windfall by suggesting that, oh, well, you can have this

22 bigger, better lot, and that will enable you to -- to

23 recover from the compensation. That goes to -- to the

24 question on -- we have of how do you -- how do you

25 determine the amount of damages?
