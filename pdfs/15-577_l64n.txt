3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:12 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case 15-577, Trinity Lutheran 5 Church v. Comer. 6 Mr. Cortman. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. CORTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 10 and may it please the Court: 11 The State of Missouri has excluded The 12 Learning Center from a recycling program that provides a 13 safer playground for children solely because the 14 preschool is operated by a church rather than a secular 15 not-for-profit. 16 The State has made several important 17 concessions in this case. Number one, that the policy 18 in this case is not facially neutral, and number two, 19 that based on their religious character, churches are 20 not eligible for the benefit here. 21 This admitted discrimination against 22 religion violates this Court's Free Exercise Principles. 23 First, as stated in McDaniel and Smith, the Free 24 Exercise Clause prevents the government from imposing 25 special disabilities on the basis of religious views or

1 religious status, and forcing a choice between the

4

2 exercise of religion and receiving either a government

3 benefit, right, or privilege.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming that there's no

5 serious risk of an establishment violation, that's off

6 the table, are there ever instances in which status --

7 religious status can be used to deny religions or

8 religious believers benefits from the State? Or are you

9 saying that it's -- that absent in Establishment Clause

10 problem, that status can never be the base -- religious

11 status can never be the basis for a governmental action

12 or governmental ordinance, governmental statute?

13 MR. CORTMAN: I -- I'm not sure if it can

14 be. I can't think of a specific example. And the

15 reason I say that is, the question is, is why would

16 someone's religious status matter in the first place to

17 receiving a government benefit? And that's another --

18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On that -- on that

19 question, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson

20 case back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms

21 what the Framers didn't want was tax money imposed to

22 pay for building or maintaining churches or church

23 property. And doesn't that fit this case? And if so,

24 is Everson passé?

25 MR. CORTMAN: I don't think it does.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Everson also said that we have to be careful in not

5

2 establishing a church not to deprive religious people or

3 organizations of general government benefits. And so I

4 think that's the key here. I think there's a difference

5 between funding of religious activities and funding

6 secular activities of religious organization. And I --

7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is the building

8 separate from the religious exercise therein? I believe

9 that this playground is part of the ministry of this

10 church. And, in fact, I look at its bylaws, I look at

11 its advertisements, and it includes play and conducted

12 in a religiously valuable way. I think that's the

13 materials that you're -- that the church is advertising.

14 How do you separate out its secular function

15 from its religious function?

16 MR. CORTMAN: I think the way the Court

17 always has. And the answer to that is, for example,

18 even though the motivation behind operating this

19 preschool is a religious motivation, doesn't mean that

20 every single activity that occurs there happens to be

21 religious.

22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how about if the

23 school does a prayer before the children start playing?

24 MR. CORTMAN: I don't think --

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or how about if it

6 1 chooses on a sunny day to do its religious instruction 2 outside. How does the State know or how can it control 3 without then controlling on the -- on the basis of 4 belief and viewpoint? How could they control against 5 that involvement? 6 MR. CORTMAN: Sure. It's the same way it 7 has in all the case law. And that is, is we have to 8 look at where's the money going to? What's it going to 9 fund? 10 And in this particular instance, for 11 example, if you look at the -- this Court's case law 12 going back from Everson and all the way forward, it 13 always said is the money going to a religious activity 14 or is it going to a secular activity? 15 This Court has approved funding to -16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But -17 MR. CORTMAN: -- religious schools, just not 18 for religious activities. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: So do you think, 20 Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a -21 from a -- a church that used its playground for 22 religious activities. Had prayer services there, for 23 example. Could the State, in your view, deny the money 24 on that ground, or at least would you think that that 25 was a significantly different case?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 MR. CORTMAN: I -- I think it would be a 2 different case. I would say the answer to the question 3 would be I don't think they should, and here's why: I 4 think there would be a -5 JUSTICE KAGAN: That they -- I'm sorry. 6 They don't think they should -7 MR. CORTMAN: They should be able to deny it 8 on that ground. And the reason I say that is, is all 9 we're talking about is a -- is a surface, a safer 10 surface on the playground for when -- when kids play. 11 As was mentioned in one of the amicus briefs, I believe 12 it was the World Vision brief, the surfacing being 13 softer doesn't enable religious activities, it doesn't 14 allow it, it doesn't prohibit it. It's really 15 completely separate and apart from it. 16 And I think a good example would be 17 something like this -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: How would you -- for 19 example, one of the things that the Court has -- has 20 thought about in the past is like computers for 21 education. So I guess somebody could make the same 22 argument about computers. Well, it doesn't really -23 it's separate from the religious instruction that might 24 be carried out over those computers. 25 Do you think that that's the same, or is it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 different?

8

2 MR. CORTMAN: I -- I think it's actually

3 easier than computers because you don't have to get into

4 diversion and all the -- the concept this Court has

5 talked about over the -- over the years in the Mitchell

6 case and the other types of cases.

7 And here the reason is, is that what we're

8 talking about is just a surface. It's not even the

9 entire playground. It's just the surface that doesn't

10 enable any religious activity.

11 So, for example, if there was a program from

12 a State that said we have a lot of old buildings in

13 town, and we're going to -- we're going to reimburse for

14 fire extinguishers for all of the old buildings,

15 including the religious schools and all the schools.

16 And they said, but if -- if you have a religious school

17 and you use this fire extinguisher reimbursement, could

18 they then be able to say now that you received that --

19 that public benefit, that safety benefit, you can no

20 longer include any religion in those classrooms or in

21 the schools?

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But don't you --

23 MR. CORTMAN: And all my point --

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Finish

25 your sentence.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
9 1 MR. CORTMAN: All my point is I think that 2 would be going too far because it's not advancing or 3 furthering the religious activity. It's separate and 4 apart from it. 5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I 6 understand your answer to the playground being used for 7 a more religious activity. Let's suppose that the 8 public school sometimes uses its playground for things 9 other than children playing, whatever they're going to 10 have, a -- you know, an auction or anything else. 11 Isn't it the consequence of your argument 12 that the church can use the playground for more 13 religious activities if the public school can use the 14 playground for other non-playground activities? 15 MR. CORTMAN: I think it can. And -- and I 16 think that the key here is, is that -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You 18 think it can what? 19 MR. CORTMAN: I think they should be able 20 to -- I think both the public schools should be able to 21 use it for other activities, and I think that the 22 religious schools should be able to also. 23 And -- and as I mentioned, I think the 24 reason for that is it would be a penalty on the benefit 25 to say because we're putting up a safer surface for when

2 here, if for some reason someone prays one day there or

3 they decide to go outside for -- for one event, that

4 doesn't -- it's not the government there who's advancing

5 religion. It's an incidental advancement that's --

6 that's done by the private party.

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Would you say --

8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are all of these questions

9 really ones that verge onto the Establishment Clause;

10 fire extinguishers, bible lessons on a sunny day, and so

11 forth? Because we could go on and on. Suppose you have

12 an earthquake safety program for schools or -- or for --

13 for public -- or for buildings with large numbers of

14 people. And you have an earthquake -- in California,

15 40 percent of the cost of structure is earthquake-proof.

16 Suppose they have earthquake reinforcement for a -- a

17 church and have to spend extra money because there --

18 there's a window in the shape of a cross.

19 That's all -- these are all establishment

20 problems?

21 MR. CORTMAN: They -- they are. And

22 interestingly in this case, the State concedes, and as

23 did the lower court, there is no Federal Establishment

24 Clause.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- see, but that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 what makes the case a -- just a little bit -- in --

11

2 in -- in my last hypothetical about earthquake safety,

3 any problem there with giving the money to a church and

4 spending extra money for the cross in the window? It's

5 all -- it's for public safety.

6 MR. CORTMAN: I think it would be an issue

7 on the -- on the Establishment Clause, the question of

8 the Establishment Clause. But once you get to the fact

9 that there is no Establishment Clause problem, which is

10 what we have here, the question then is can you single

11 out religious people or religious organizations for a

12 penalty from this benefit? Or, as this Court said in

13 McDaniel and Sherbert, is that you're forcing them to

14 choose between exercising their religious faith and

15 receiving the -- a public benefit.

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm sorry --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to my first

18 question, that means what your position is, if there is

19 no Establishment violation, there can never be a

20 distinction based on religion.

21 MR. CORTMAN: I wouldn't say never. We --

22 we --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Give me an example.

24 MR. CORTMAN: Well, play in -- what comes to

25 mind is Locke v. Davey and play in the joints. And the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
12 1 reason that's an important one there is because that was 2 a narrow distinction that was based on, what this Court 3 said, a unique historical interest. And the Court also 4 said that the program there went a long way to include 5 religion. Here, it closes religion right out at the 6 door. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry -8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We -- we did -9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but it does -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We did say in this 11 case -- well, I think you stipulated that this school 12 has a nondiscriminatory admissions policy. But suppose 13 it didn't. Suppose its policy was we prefer Lutheran 14 children, and then if we have any space left over after 15 that, we'll take other Christians. And then after that, 16 maybe Jews, and then everyone else. Everything else is 17 the same. They want the paving of their playground. 18 Could -- could this -- could they demand as 19 a matter of Federal constitutional right that that 20 playground be funded, even though they have an -- an 21 admissions policy that favors members of their church? 22 MR. CORTMAN: I -- I think they can, because 23 they have a -- they have a free exercise right to 24 religious autonomy to decide who their members are. In 25 fact, most private organizations and religious

13

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So this church could say,

3 we will take only Lutheran children.

4 MR. CORTMAN: I believe it can.

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and still get the

6 public money.

7 MR. CORTMAN: I believe so, because we're

8 still at the premise of -- of why are we making the

9 church choose between exercising its religion, the same

10 facts in McDaniel v. Paty, and saying he can't both be a

11 minister and also be a constitutional delegate.

12 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Cortman, do we know what

13 Missouri -- how Missouri interprets the term "church" in

14 its constitution? It speaks about church. Does it have

15 to be -- is this a matter of the form of the ownership

16 of a facility? Is this playground considered to be --

17 by the State to be part of the church because of its

18 proximity to the church? What if it was a -- what if we

19 had a -- a religiously affiliated school that was not

20 adjacent to a church and it had a playground. Would

21 they consider that to be part of -- would they consider

22 that to fall within the prohibition?

23 MR. CORTMAN: I think it would depending on

24 how religious it is. And so what Missouri Supreme Court

25 case law has -- says, number one, any -- any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 organization that's owned or controlled by a church. So 2 that answers the church part. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: So if it's controlled. 4 MR. CORTMAN: That's right. 5 And also, any religious organizations that 6 are sectarian or denominational. And so it's not only 7 the church, it's other religious organizations. 8 And Missouri Supreme Court case law says the 9 way we decide those questions is -- is -- is how much 10 religious influence is there in a church? In other 11 words, are they serious about their faith? Do they -12 is it voluntary for the students there? And so there's 13 a question about how religious you may be in order to 14 receive the benefit or not. But it's clear it applies 15 to -- to religious organizations, and that's what their 16 briefing has conceded, and to churches. 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cortman, my questions 18 about religious uses, I think, was to get at a -- a 19 broader point, a broader distinction, and asked -- ask 20 what you think of it. And as it seems that you are on 21 strongest ground when you say, look, the State has 22 decided to fund some activity, and it's denying that -23 that funding to a particular party based solely on that 24 party's religious status. 25 MR. CORTMAN: Yes.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
15 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's the way you 2 briefed the case. 3 I hear you making a different argument, or a 4 broader argument now, that extends into a State's 5 decision to deny some uses -- to deny funding to some 6 uses at the same time as it gives funding to other uses, 7 and a State's decision to say, look, we really just 8 don't want to fund religious exercise. They can do 9 religious exercise. We don't want to fund religious 10 exercise. And I understand that you might think that's 11 out of bounds, too. But what I'm trying to figure out 12 is, is there a distinction between these two things. 13 MR. CORTMAN: I don't think it's a broader 14 argument that we're making. What I'm -- what I'm trying 15 to communicate is, is that when you look at what you're 16 funding -- so this program says that you can't use this 17 money for any religious activities and it has to go 18 toward the playground resurfacing. So it's actually a 19 reimbursement grant whereas the church already lays out 20 the finances. Once it proves that it's put down the 21 surfacing, then it puts its information in and gets 22 reimbursed for it. So the money has to be used for 23 that. 24 My only point is, is can the State then say, 25 for example, in Everson and Allen, now that we've given
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
16 1 you this bus transportation or these books, you can't 2 engage in any religious activity once we've given you 3 that separate benefit. Not that you can't use the money 4 for religious activity, which you cannot, and we 5 don't -- we don't disagree with that. The question 6 is -7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So you don't disagree 8 with that. 9 MR. CORTMAN: That's right. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the State is entitled to 11 say you can't use this money for religious activity, and 12 maybe I'll bring you a little bit further, we're 13 entitled to take certain prophylactic measures to make 14 sure that you don't use the money for religious 15 activity. 16 MR. CORTMAN: Yes. But -- I absolutely 17 agree. But once you take that benefit, I think it goes 18 too far to say, like in Allen, for example, we're 19 providing you with these textbooks, so you have to stop 20 all religion in your school. And that's all my point 21 of -- that I was trying to -22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then how about the -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does the record 24 show about non-daycare or playground activities on this 25 surface?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
17 1 MR. CORTMAN: There's -- there's nothing in 2 the record that occurs except for children playing on 3 the playground. 4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, but you were 5 talking about Locke -6 MR. CORTMAN: Yeah. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and how this is 8 dissimilar from Locke. 9 MR. CORTMAN: Yes. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there is a 11 tradition. There are 39 States with constitutional 12 amendments like the one Missouri has. That's a history 13 that's even longer than the Locke history. And the 14 essence of that history is, basically, we don't want to, 15 as a country -- well, the vast majority of States, to 16 fund houses of worship. One would think that if there's 17 play in the joints, that that would include the concept 18 that States are free to say we don't want to spend money 19 from the public FIs on houses of worship. 20 Now, you say this affects free exercise. We 21 seem to be confusing money with religious practice. I 22 don't think the two are tied. This church is not going 23 to close its religious practices or its doors because 24 its playground doesn't have these tires. So I'm not 25 sure how this is a free-exercise question, because there
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 is no effect on the religious beliefs. No one is asking 2 the church to change its beliefs. In fact, no one is 3 asking the church as a condition of saying don't use 4 what we give you for religious purposes; they're not 5 even doing that. They're just saying we don't want to 6 be involved with the church. 7 MR. CORTMAN: Sure. But there's -- there's 8 government coercion when you say there's a public 9 benefit, and the only way you could receive that public 10 benefit is if you do not exercise your religion. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why is that coercion 12 with respect to your beliefs? 13 MR. CORTMAN: Because it's -- it's a choice, 14 just like with McDaniel v. Paty. He could not do both 15 things simultaneously. He could not -- Mr. McDaniel 16 could not both be a minister and be a constitutional 17 delegate, and what the court said forcing that choice -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you can have a 19 playground here. 20 MR. CORTMAN: But you can't be -- you can't 21 be a religious organization and have a playground. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have a playground. 23 No one is taking the playground away from you. 24 MR. CORTMAN: No. But you're -- you're 25 being penalized by not receiving the public benefit --
Alderson Reporting Company

19 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. The priest was 2 being penalized. The priest was being told you can't be 3 a priest or a congressman. So you can't do one or the 4 other. 5 MR. CORTMAN: Right. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Here, there's nothing 7 being taken away from. 8 MR. CORTMAN: Sure. It's the same public 9 benefit. You can't be both, run this -- operate this 10 daycare as a religious organization and receive the 11 public benefit. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with 13 discrimination for religion under your theory? Because 14 the way you're going in your theory is an expansion of 15 McDaniel; but putting aside that it's an expansion of 16 McDaniel, what are we going to end up with when secular 17 people say religious people are being discriminated in 18 favor of and against us? If status should not be an 19 effect on free exercise, what are we going to do with 20 tax benefits? 21 MR. CORTMAN: I think -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What are we going to do 23 with all the exemptions that churches receive? 24 MR. CORTMAN: Sure. 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are benefits.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
20 1 MR. CORTMAN: Sure. And I would say that 2 the -- the clauses take care of that. So, for example, 3 if it goes too far and the government benefit is solely 4 favoring religion, it's likely a violation of the 5 Establishment Clause. But we also have a -6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's plenty of 7 people who would think tax exemption goes too far. 8 MR. CORTMAN: Right. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I don't. I'm just 10 saying there are people who make that claim. 11 MR. CORTMAN: Sure. And the Court's already 12 ruled on that. And so on one side you have the 13 Establishment Clause. If you're going too far to favor 14 religion, there's an Establishment Clause problem; but 15 if you go the other side on the Free Exercise Clause, 16 this Court has said for decades, sometimes we may and 17 even must accommodate religion, and I think is the 18 favorable treatment that Your Honor is talking about. 19 But I think all the clauses work together in that route. 20 If you take it too far, you do have an Establishment 21 Clause problem. 22 In this -- this case, it's considered there 23 is no Establishment Clause problem, and -- and there is 24 a point where you can accommodate religion, this other 25 benefit, under the Free Exercise Clause, but I think

21 1 they all balance out each other. And in this particular 2 case, it's not only McDaniel v. Paty, but McCauley 3 specifically said that if you target religion on its -4 on its face, which this policy does, then it's -- it's 5 unconstitutional. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: And Mr. Cortman, I don't 7 know whether we -- excuse me. I don't know whether we 8 need to get into the history of this particular 9 amendment here. I tend to think we don't need to, but 10 at the beginning of the line of questioning that Justice 11 Sotomayor just finished, she began with the suggestion 12 that perhaps this amendment reflects an admirable 13 historical tradition that should be respected. 14 Do you think that that is the proper way to 15 analyze this question? 16 MR. CORTMAN: I don't. And -- and this -17 this particular provision that we're discussing, they 18 are -- and this has been briefed by several amicus 19 briefs and -- and briefly by us, is a product of what we 20 would consider to be one of the Blaine Amendments that 21 was not found in Locke v. Davey. And the reason for 22 that is, is it has that same language in the Blaine 23 Amendment. It was adopted the same exact year, and 24 there is much history showing about the anti-Catholic 25 bigotry that's behind this specific provision, and

5 debate about that, isn't there?

6 MR. CORTMAN: There is. And that's why our

7 argument is, is we believe it is one, but it -- it

8 doesn't matter to the deciding of this case.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: Has the -- has the -- the

11 the State from giving grants or from spending money on

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Have they ever said that it

15 prevents the State from, say, having a -- a border

24 we have a governor. He said he's going to give you the

24 1 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I see that. 2 What case would you cite? 3 MR. CORTMAN: I -- I -- excuse me. I think 4 the best two cases are Friends of the Earth and the Knox 5 case. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 7 MR. CORTMAN: In fact, I think those cases 8 are more difficult cases than -9 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay. Fine. 10 MR. CORTMAN: -- this case, because of the 11 voluntary cessation proposition. But I think that's -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's two -- there's 13 two questions, isn't there? One is we're talking about 14 is the case moot, and I think, technically, it's not 15 moot. But if we think -- suppose Missouri had a policy 16 that it has today, very recently, and we were asked to 17 grant cert in this case. That would be a factor in our 18 decision whether we thought this was an appropriate case 19 to review, wouldn't it? 20 MR. CORTMAN: This case would have to be 21 here, I guess, in a different posture, maybe coming from 22 the other side, if that was already the policy. I think 23 one of the problems is, is that the original policy was 24 based on the Missouri Supreme Court's interpretation. 25 So what's interesting here is there's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
25 1 already talk that the new policy is immediately going to 2 be go challenged, and likely struck down by the Missouri 3 Supreme Court. So absent a ruling here, the -- the old 4 policy will be back in place. And that's why it's 5 important for the Court to rule because it's not -- this 6 isn't a permanent change by any means. It's a temporary 7 change. In fact, the government is -- is actually 8 defending both the old policy and the new policy, which 9 I think shows why this Court needs to issue a ruling. 10 And -- but I think what's likely to happen 11 under the Voluntary Cessation Doctrine, especially as 12 this Court has said, we look at this with a -- a 13 critical eye because of the 11th hour change, is the 14 State free to return to its old ways? It clearly is, 15 not only in this administration, but in the new lawsuit 16 being brought to challenge the new policy, because it 17 violates why we're here in the first place, is the 18 Missouri State constitutional provision. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: May I take you back to the 20 substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's 21 talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I 22 would like to know. You know, usually when we see these 23 funding cases, it comes in a different context. It 24 comes where the State wants to give money and somebody 25 is objecting. And this case comes in the converse way,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 where a State says we just don't want to fund --

26

2 MR. CORTMAN: Right.

3 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- this institution. And

4 these -- these church/States divide, it's a -- it's a

5 fraught issue. It's a hard issue. It's a -- it's an

6 issue in which States have their own very longstanding

7 law. It's an issue on which I -- I guess I'm going to

8 say nobody is completely sure that they have it right.

9 And -- and so I guess there's something attractive about

10 having some play in the joints where States can go their

11 own way and make their own choices. And why shouldn't

12 this be one of those cases?

13 MR. CORTMAN: Because I don't think this is

14 one of the difficult cases. In fact, I would say, with

15 all the Court's jurisprudence under Free Exercise and

16 Establishment Clause, this is actually one of the easier

17 cases. And the reason for that is if you look at the

18 play in joints, the first conclusion was there was no

19 Free Exercise violation there. Here, there clearly is.

20 If you look at the Court's case law under Sherbert and

21 McDaniel and McCauley and Smith, this is clearly

22 singling out a religious organization with no

23 justification to do so. So just having a Free Exercise

24 violation takes it out of the play in the joints where

25 there wasn't one there.

Alderson Reporting Company

27 1 I think the other thing is, if you're 2 looking at the -3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's, of course, 4 true, that if there's a -- a constitutional right at 5 stake, that trumps. But the question is, how are we 6 going to interpret the constitutional right? What are 7 we -- so -- so I guess what I'm asking is, do you see 8 value in the other side in having some flexibility here 9 for States to make these sorts of choices? 10 MR. CORTMAN: I think States have tremendous 11 leeway in the way they set up and decide these types of 12 programs. And here's what I would say, which I think is 13 an easy solution. Number one, the State doesn't have to 14 set up the program in the first place. Number two, it 15 could set it up in a way that said, we're only going to 16 do government schools' playgrounds and not any private 17 schools. 18 But once it sets up the program to include 19 all not-for-profits and all not-for-profit preschools, 20 it sets out 16 different criteria, neutral criteria, 21 that everyone has to comply with. Then the question is, 22 is -- when you have a -- a religious organization that 23 meets those criteria; in fact, does better on them than 24 almost everybody else, and then you look at the 25 application and say, well, we just found out you're
Alderson Reporting Company

1 operated by a religious organization, we're going to

28

2 take you back out of that, even though you meet the

3 State's criteria and further our interest better than

4 almost everybody else, that seems to be not a

5 difficult --

6 JUSTICE KAGAN: But one last -- I know your

7 white light is on. But might the State think that

8 here's the problem. The problem is this church has come

9 in with a very competitive application. We want to give

10 money to this church. Let's say, you know, a Protestant

11 church. There's a Catholic church across the street.

12 Catholic church applies, doesn't get money, this happens

13 five years running. And people start thinking, well,

14 why is the Protestant church keeping on getting the

15 money and the Catholic church never gets the money? And

16 the State says, we just won't -- don't want to sow that

17 kind of division, that kind of mistrust, that kind of --

18 well, that --

19 MR. CORTMAN: Sure. It sounds like a -- a

20 reasonable observer question, but put that aside for a

21 second. If you know the history and context of the

22 program, you would know that this is a competitive

23 grant, and they actually should be religion blind.

24 So if you're not looking at who is applying,

25 you can grade this just like this application was graded

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 highly, based on secular and neutral criteria. So

29

2 anyone knows that the program is purely religion blind,

3 not looking at who's applying, they'll know that it's

4 not favoring any religious organization or secular.

5 But what you do when you favor -- when you

6 remove the religious organizations, even though you've

7 scored them high under your own competition, you're

8 actually singling out for -- for a benefit they should

9 otherwise get under Free Exercise.

10 If I might save the rest of my time.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

12 Mr. Layton.

13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON

14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15 MR. LAYTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

16 please the Court:

17 Justice Alito asked the question as to

18 whether this is an admirable tradition that should be

19 respected, this 39-State tradition of have -- keeping

20 hands off of religion, and the answer from the States'

21 view is yes.

22 In 1820, Missouri's first constitutional

23 convention adopted from Jefferson's Virginia Statute for

24 Religious Freedom the language that, "No man can be

25 compelled to erect, support, or attend any place of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 worship."

30

2 We modified that, made it more specific in

3 the 1865 and 1875 constitutions. And in 1945, it was

4 reenacted in our latest constitution with reference back

5 to the founding era.

6 The -- the question, then, is whether that

7 fits within this Court's jurisprudence under the First

8 Amendment. And there we look at both the Establishment

9 Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, and the play

10 between the joints that this Court confirmed or

11 recognized in Locke v. Davey.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't want

13 us -- you say we don't have to look at the Establishment

14 Clause. In your brief, you said there's no

15 Establishment Clause problem here.

16 MR. LAYTON: No. I -- we say that there is

17 not an Establishment Clause violation. Some of the

18 amici on our site -- side say that there is, but no,

19 that in the State's view, there is not an Establishment

20 Clause violation. And so Governor Greitens' decision to

21 proceed differently does not violate the Establishment

22 Clause.

23 The question is whether that's the limit.

24 There are Establishment Clause concerns here, even if

25 there's not a violation. And those concerns arise both

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 with regard to endorsement and with regard to

31

2 entanglement.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is it your argument

4 that this statute is valid to keep us away from close

5 Establishment Clause questions?

6 MR. LAYTON: Yes. Yes. We don't want to be

7 in a position, for example, in this case, where we are

8 selecting among churches. We don't want to be in a

9 position where we are making a visible, physical

10 improvement on church property.

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but this -- this is

12 quite different than Locke, because this is a

13 status-based statute.

14 MR. LAYTON: Well, in -- in that respect, it

15 is different. In other respects it's different as well.

16 For example, in that case, we have independent

17 decisionmaking, which has been key to many of this

18 Court's decisions. In this Court, the decisionmaking is

19 not by some third party, it is by the State.

20 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Layton, you said

21 you don't want to -- you don't want to have a program

22 that makes physical improvements to -- to churches. And

23 I just wanted to ask you about some Federal laws that

24 are highlighted in the amicus brief filed by the Union

25 of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, and get your reaction

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 whether a program like that would be permissible under 2 the Missouri constitution. 3 So one of them is a Federal nonprofit 4 security grant program providing grants through the 5 Department of Homeland Security to harden -- harden 6 nonprofit organization facilities that are deemed to be 7 at high risk for terrorist attacks. So if you have a -8 a synagogue that is at high risk for an attack by an 9 anti-Semitic group or a mosque that is considered to be 10 at high risk for attack by an anti-Muslim group, would 11 the Missouri constitution permit the erection of 12 bollards like we have around the court here? 13 MR. LAYTON: The answer traditionally -- and 14 I'm not sure that I can speak for the current 15 governor -- of course, I was brought back to argue this 16 case and instructed I could defend the prior position, 17 but the answer traditionally would be no. State money 18 could not be used to actually erect or -- or operate or 19 provide that kind of physical addition to a -- to a 20 church or synagogue. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Here's another one. 22 I have two more, if you'll indulge me. 23 This is a Federal program that provided 24 grants for the repair of buildings near the Federal 25 building in Oklahoma City that were damaged by the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 bombing there. Would that be permitted?

33

2 MR. LAYTON: Under the traditional view of

3 -- in the State of Missouri, it would not be permitted,

4 provided that those were actually church buildings.

5 Worship buildings.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Last one. This is a

7 New York City program that provides security -- money

8 for security enhancements at schools where there's fear

9 of shooting or other school violence.

10 MR. LAYTON: Again, under the traditional

11 view in Missouri, if -- if this was actually a cash

12 grant, money leaving the public treasury to go to a

13 church, it would not be permissible.

14 Now, that doesn't mean that a

15 religious-affiliated school could not qualify. The

16 St. Louis University case by the Missouri Supreme Court

17 shows that the Missouri courts have been willing to draw

18 the definition of churches and religious institutions

19 pretty narrowly.

20 JUSTICE ALITO: So what is the definition of

21 a church? So a religiously-affiliated school is not a

22 church under the -- under the Missouri constitution?

23 MR. LAYTON: The decision with regard to

24 St. Louis University was that even though it is a Jesuit

25 institution that is founded by Jesuits, had a Jesuit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 president and Jesuits on its board, since it had a

34

2 self-perpetuating board, even though it declared a -- a

3 Jesuit philosophy, it was determined to be eligible to

4 receive -- in that instance not direct payment from the

5 State, but eligible to receive State funds.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: But why --

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Layton --

8 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would that be so?

9 MR. LAYTON: I suspect because the Missouri

10 courts are trying to provide as much assistance as they

11 can within the realm that they feel that the Missouri

12 constitution permits.

13 JUSTICE ALITO: Oh. So suppose you -- we

14 have the -- a school that's run by the Trinity Lutheran

15 Church of Columbia. And then next to it we have a -- a

16 Jesuit elementary and secondary school. One would be

17 eligible, one would not be eligible?

18 MR. LAYTON: It would depend on the nature

19 of the two. In fact, if the Trinity Lutheran went back

20 to the position it was in in 1985 where the preschool

21 was an independent, although somewhat affiliated, entity

22 using the church's facilities, presumably under some

23 kind of a lease arrangement, the State likely would have

24 said yes, because that would be consistent --

25 JUSTICE ALITO: But even though they're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 equally controlled by a religious organizations?

35

2 MR. LAYTON: No. I don't think -- I -- it

3 would be a fine line in terms of the control. But no,

4 if the organization itself, the church itself rather

5 than the self-perpetuating board, such as with St. Louis

6 University, controlled the -- the preschool, that --

7 that is what has made the difference in Missouri in the

8 past, although understand, we have very few cases in

9 Missouri that have addressed these questions.

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Layton, could we go back

11 to where Justice Alito started --

12 MR. LAYTON: Yes.

13 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and -- and you said no

14 money to churches. Why can the State provide police

15 protection or fire protection?

16 MR. LAYTON: Well, the -- the -- the State

17 does, and I think for a couple of reasons. One is that

18 we are not actually taking money from the State treasury

19 and giving it to the church. And this Court has seldom,

20 if ever, actually said it's okay to write a check from

21 the public treasury to a church. So this -- we're

22 providing a service. And the service there is not being

23 provided solely for the benefit of the church. The

24 service is being provided for police and fire for the

25 benefit of the public safety --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
36 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but the whole -2 that's easy to change. I mean, we imagine a State, 3 State X. And State X says, we're not going to provide 4 police protection. We will for everybody, but not a 5 church. And by the way, that costs us extra money. We 6 have to hire extra policemen -- revoke. 7 Okay? That's all. Why not? 8 MR. LAYTON: That -9 JUSTICE BREYER: We don't want -- we 10 don't -- we don't want to because they're a church. 11 That's why not. 12 Same with fire protection. Same with 13 vaccination programs. Same with public health. Same 14 with helping children who get sick at school. Okay? 15 You know, the hypotheticals are obvious. Nothing to do 16 with Missouri. But as soon as you answer that, I'll be 17 able to know that ask you a question and how does this 18 differ. Okay? 19 MR. LAYTON: Well, this -- this differs -20 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not asking that 21 yet. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. LAYTON: So what -- what are you asking 24 first? 25 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 (Laughter.)

37

2 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking, does the

3 Constitution of the United States permit a State or a

4 city to say, we give everybody in this city police

5 protection, but not churches? We give everybody fire

6 protection, but let the church burn down. We give

7 everybody public health protection, but not a church.

8 That's -- that's the law in my imaginary State.

9 And I'm saying, does the Constitution, which

10 guarantees free exercise of religion, permit such laws?

11 MR. LAYTON: I -- I am not going to take the

12 position that it permits those laws --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now you say no,

14 it does not permit those laws. Very well.

15 If it does not permit a law that pays money

16 out of the treasury for the health of the children in

17 the church, school, or even going to church, how does it

18 permit Missouri to deny money to the same place for

19 helping children not fall in the playground, cut their

20 knees, get tetanus, break a leg, et cetera? What's the

21 difference?

22 MR. LAYTON: The difference is that the

23 establishment concerns that motivate Missouri's policy

24 do not apply in the police and fire context, but they

25 apply here.

Alderson Reporting Company

38 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Why in health context? So 2 if there's -3 MR. LAYTON: No. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- an epidemic? 5 MR. LAYTON: No, I don't know that they 6 apply in health context. Because the kind of examples 7 Your Honor is giving are examples where the -- the 8 benefits are universal. They are not selective, which 9 they are here; they are universal. 10 So we start on the endorsement side. In 11 those instances, the State is not endorsing a particular 12 church by choosing to provide that church with those 13 benefits and not another church, which is -14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Layton, I understand 15 that -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Establishment 17 Clause -- the -- the entire basis for your rule is that 18 you're afraid of violating the Establishment Clause, 19 even though you're sure there's no violation of the 20 Establishment Clause? 21 MR. LAYTON: No. I -- it -- it is that we 22 do not want to come to the edge of violating the 23 Establishment Clause. I mean, we are not taking the 24 position that we would by doing this, but the 25 question --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you take the 2 position that it is not, that this is not a violation -3 MR. LAYTON: It is not a violation. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Establishment 5 Clause violation. 6 MR. LAYTON: The question is, do we have to 7 come all the way to the edge of a violation, which is 8 what I think Petitioners are arguing. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, I -10 MR. LAYTON: But it -- that it -- that as 11 long as we aren't violating, there is no room between. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Layton, let's say 13 I -- I accept that the State might have an interest in 14 saying we just don't want to be seen as giving money to 15 one church and not another in these selective programs. 16 MR. LAYTON: And that's the endorsement 17 side. There's also entanglement. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. I -19 JUSTICE KAGAN: I -- I think that that's 20 legitimate. 21 But here's the thing. There's a 22 constitutional principle. It's as strong as any 23 constitutional principle that there is, that when we 24 have a program of funding -- and here we're funding 25 playground surfaces -- that everybody is entitled to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 that funding, to -- to that particular funding, whether 2 or not they exercise a constitutional right; in other 3 words, here, whether or not they are a religious 4 institution doing religious things. As long as you're 5 using the money for playground services, you're not 6 disentitled from that program because you're a religious 7 institution doing religious things. 8 And I would have thought that that's a 9 pretty strong principle in our constitutional law. And 10 how is that the State says that that's not violated 11 here? 12 MR. LAYTON: Well, let me react to the way 13 that you set that out. If we're only going to look at 14 the rubber, then what Your Honor asks does make sense. 15 But the rubber doesn't have any meaning until it's 16 placed there and is available for use. And under this 17 theory, we not only have to put rubber on playgrounds, 18 but don't we have to put new paint on the sanctuary if 19 the old one had lead paint? Don't we have to put -20 pay -- reimburse for pews to be upholstered? I mean, 21 what -- what is the -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not -- maybe not -23 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- not under -- not 25 under Locke, right? Locke drew a distinction between
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 assistance for devotional, theological education and

41

2 scholarship and others.

3 MR. LAYTON: It did.

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So perhaps -- I

5 mean, maybe you'd have a good argument. Or on the other

6 hand, maybe if you painted the interior of all sorts of

7 other buildings but singled out religious, I don't know.

8 But it seems to me that that's -- raises much more

9 serious problems than this case.

10 MR. LAYTON: I don't think that Locke

11 raise -- I think that this case raises more serious

12 problems than Locke in a number of respects. It is a

13 direct payment to a church. It's not an indirect

14 payment chosen by someone else. It is not available to

15 everyone. It's only available to those who are selected

16 that --

17 JUSTICE KAGAN: But here's the deal. You're

18 right that this is a selective program. It's not a

19 general program in which everybody gets money. But

20 still the question is whether some people can be

21 disentitled from applying to that program and from

22 receiving that money if they are qualified based on

23 other completely nonreligious attributes, and they're

24 disqualified solely because they are a religious

25 institution doing religious things. Even though they're

Alderson Reporting Company

42 1 not -- they could -- they could promise you, we're not 2 going to do religious things on this playground surface, 3 and you're still saying, well, no, you -- you can't get 4 the money. 5 MR. LAYTON: Well, they -- they could, but 6 that still doesn't get us out of the entanglement issues 7 here. We have a church that, in order to participate, 8 has to agree to curriculum requirements in their 9 preschool. The idea that the government is going to 10 dictate what is taught at a church, even if they're 11 willing to accept it, which they are here, is anathema 12 to the Establishment Clause considerations that have 13 highlighted many of these questions -14 JUSTICE BREYER: You suggested two lines. 15 I'm back to my question -16 MR. LAYTON: Yes. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which is really quite 18 similar to what Justice Kagan is asking. You -- once 19 you accepted the first part of what I asked, you agree 20 there has to be a line. 21 MR. LAYTON: Yes. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, one line you've 23 suggested is the question that you're selecting rather 24 than giving to any -- everyone. 25 MR. LAYTON: Universal versus select.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
43 1 JUSTICE BREYER: But would you say the same 2 case, were you to give the money to all schools instead 3 of just some by selection, then would be 4 unconstitutional barring churches? I don't think you 5 would. But wait. Say the other line. 6 The other line, which I want you to 7 contrast, is that where there is a grant given to all 8 schools, private and public, and the purpose -- and that 9 grant has nothing to do with religious practice, but it 10 does -- has to do with health or safety. Then you have 11 to do it. What about that? 12 MR. LAYTON: Well, that's -13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's -- because 14 you win -- you lose -- or you win on the first; you lose 15 on the second. 16 MR. LAYTON: That -- that is -17 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, they are two competing 18 lines that I'm at least seeing. Maybe there's some 19 others. 20 MR. LAYTON: If the sole benefit to the 21 church and its members was health and safety and we 22 could draw that line, that may make some sense. But, of 23 course, that's not true here. It's -- it's more than 24 that here. What we are being asked to give to this 25 church is actually a visible improvement in their
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
44 1 physical plant. And understand that this is a church 2 that declares in their petition that they use this 3 preschool to bring the gospel message to nonmembers. 4 This is -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's -- it's 6 not -- now your line is the benefit, if the benefit is 7 physical, that's okay; but if it's not, it's not? 8 MR. LAYTON: No. I'm saying -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is your 10 issue? Your -- your answer said the -- the issue here 11 is that it's the physical area near the church. 12 MR. LAYTON: No. I'm saying that -- that 13 even physical changes, even if they have a safety 14 element, may still have an entanglement problem. 15 Because we are saying to the church, you -- you have 16 this now incentive to rearrange your property, your 17 church site, in order to maximize the amount you get 18 from the State rather than maximizing the spiritual 19 development of the children. 20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you had a 21 program at the -- the State capital? You had tours for 22 school groups, and you had someone who, you know, 23 coordinated, tied it into the social studies program; 24 school groups can come in, but no religious schools. 25 Is that okay?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
45 1 MR. LAYTON: I don't know that it would be. 2 We don't know who -- we -- we -- frankly, we have tours 3 like that, and we -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to have a 5 position. And -- and it seems to me that if you can't 6 answer the question whether or not you could prohibit 7 tours for religious schools while allowing tours for 8 other schools, I don't understand the basis of your 9 program -- your position. 10 MR. LAYTON: The -- the tours, at least in 11 our experience, are also universal. Everyone who comes 12 to the capital gets a tour. And so -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -14 MR. LAYTON: -- we would be -- in terms of 15 universal versus selective, we would be in that same 16 range. But also with regard to entanglement, the tours 17 do not require the State to be entangled in any way with 18 the church and its ministry. And the playground 19 improvement here does require that, not just as to 20 curriculum, but as to the manner in which this is done, 21 and the way in which it is portrayed to the community. 22 That's the kind of entanglement that -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what do you 24 mean, "the way it is portrayed to the community"? 25 MR. LAYTON: Well, among other things, in --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
46 1 in this particular program, the church gets points for 2 telling people in the community that the State paid for 3 this improvement to their church. And so the -- in 4 essence, it -- it exacerbates the endorsement problem by 5 telling them what they have to say publicly about this 6 particular improvement. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you could say the 8 same thing, that -- that the church is delighted that it 9 has fire protection. 10 MR. LAYTON: Well, I -- I suppose if we 11 said -12 (Laughter.) 13 MR. LAYTON: -- we're only going to provide 14 fire protection to churches that will declare publicly 15 that they appreciate the States providing that, maybe; 16 but, again, that's not selective. And so that -- that 17 statement by the church has no meaning. It -- it can't 18 be perceived as an endorsement. But when I drive past 19 this church and this church has this beautiful new 20 playground surface that the State paid for, I am 21 receiving a message with regard to the State in this 22 particular regard. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: And -- and so long as the 24 money is granted based on neutral criteria that are 25 faithfully applied, I don't know how you can draw a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
47 1 distinction between a program that's open to everybody 2 and a selective program. 3 I mean, suppose Missouri offered 50 full 4 college scholarships every year to students who achieved 5 certain academic criteria -- who satisfied certain 6 academic criteria, and this was open to public school 7 students and private school students. But, you know, 8 after a few years, the school saw -- the State saw that 9 a disproportionate number of these were going -- among 10 those given to the religiously affiliate, to the private 11 schools, a disproportionate were -- a number of the 12 scholarships were going to students at schools that are 13 affiliated with a particular faith. 14 Would it be, then, justified to say, well, 15 we better not -- we better disqualify every student who 16 went to a religiously affiliated school so there aren't 17 any hard feelings? 18 MR. LAYTON: Well, I think that may be an 19 Equal Protection problem, because I don't know what 20 the -- the basis for that would be. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: So what's the difference 22 between that situation and this situation -23 MR. LAYTON: Well, here, it's -24 JUSTICE ALITO: -- as far as the difference 25 between selective and nonselective?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
48 1 MR. LAYTON: If we're going to deal with the 2 Equal Protection approach to this, then the question 3 becomes whether our endorsement and entanglement 4 concerns are a rational basis. 5 JUSTICE ALITO: No. I'm not talking about 6 equal protection. You -- you said there's -- that it 7 matters that this is selective as opposed to not 8 selective. 9 MR. LAYTON: Yes. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: And what is the basis for 11 drawing that distinction? I thought that -- I thought 12 your asserted basis was it prevents the perception of 13 favoritism. 14 MR. LAYTON: Yes, it -- it does. Because 15 this is a very selective program, very few institutions 16 get it. And unlike the scholarship example or, frankly, 17 the example in Locke v. Davey, it is a publicly visible 18 manifest demonstration of State endorsement. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I don't understand -20 I -- I think I understand how the States' interests 21 might differ some, but essentially this is a program 22 open to everyone. Happens to be a competitive program, 23 but everyone is open to compete on various neutral 24 terms, and you're depriving one set of actors from being 25 able to compete in the same way everybody else can

1 compete because of their religious identification.

49

2 MR. LAYTON: And that is what we are doing,

3 because we are concerned about the endorsement and

4 entanglement issues that arise in connection with this

5 type of a program.

6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. And those are

7 interests. I don't mean to say that those are not valid

8 interests. But it does seem as though this is a clear

9 burden -- looked at that way, this is a clear burden on

10 a constitutional right. And then your interests have to

11 rise to an extremely high level.

12 MR. LAYTON: Well, I don't know that I --

13 I --

14 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's a burden on

15 constitutional right, in other words, because people of

16 a certain religious status are being prevented from

17 competing in the same way everybody else is for a

18 neutral benefit.

19 MR. LAYTON: Well, this -- this is -- it's

20 not like McDaniel where someone is being barred from

21 participating in -- in the life of the -- the community.

22 This is a -- kind of the opposite of that. It is not

23 like the -- what we have in Locke, in the sense that --

24 that here we have -- we -- we really have a -- a direct

25 payment to a church.

50 1 I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I'm answering 2 your question, Your Honor. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Cortman -- I'm 4 sorry. 5 Mr. Layton, I'm -- I'm -- I know the Court 6 is very grateful that you took up the request of the 7 Missouri Attorney General to defend the old position, 8 but I -- I am worried about the, if not the mootness, 9 the adversity in this case. If the Attorney General is 10 in favor of the position that your adversary is taking, 11 isn't his appointment of you creating adversity that 12 doesn't exist? 13 MR. LAYTON: Well, I don't know the answer 14 to that -- that, but let me -- let me give some of the 15 factual background here. 16 The Attorney General himself is recused 17 because he actually appears on one of the briefs on the 18 other side. The first assistant in this instance is the 19 Acting Attorney General, and the Acting Attorney 20 General, at a time before governor -- the governor gave 21 his new instruction, asked me to defend the position, 22 because at that point, it was still the position of the 23 State, and was not being disavowed. 24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's the 25 question. It doesn't appear to be the position of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 State right now. Reading through the lines of the

51

2 Acting Attorney General to us, it doesn't appear that he

3 believes that you're taking the right position.

4 MR. LAYTON: So -- so let me talk about what

5 has happened and what -- what happens next.

6 After the governor did -- made his

7 announcement, the director, who is my client here, in

8 fact, put up on her website the 2017 application and

9 2017 instructions, in which she largely tracked the 2016

10 and prior ones, including 2012 that the Court has, but

11 eliminated all reference to churches, religious

12 instruction; all of those were eliminated.

13 That's all I know about what she intends to

14 do, because I don't represent her with regard to that

15 decision.

16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm asking a simple

17 question. If she -- if the State and she as the

18 representative of the State are not willing to fight

19 this case, are they manufacturing adversity by

20 appointing you?

21 MR. LAYTON: So -- well --

22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we have no adversity,

23 hasn't this case become mooted?

24 MR. LAYTON: So let me -- let me tell you

25 what happens next if the director actually grants --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 issues a grant to a church.

52

2 If she does, then under Missouri's liberal

3 taxpayer standing rules, someone can then sue and say

4 you are violating the State constitution. And if there

5 is a determination that -- that she was filing in the

6 State constitution, then the question before the -- the

7 Court today would have to be answered.

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- do you agree

10 that this -- this Court's voluntary cessation policies

11 apply to the mootness question?

12 MR. LAYTON: I agree that they can apply to

13 this. It's not a perfect fit compared to some of the

14 precedents, but -- but certainly there is no assurance

15 that four years from now, with a change of

16 administration, or at some point in the interim through

17 a taxpayer standing suit, that there wouldn't be a -- a

18 change back to the prior practice.

19 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Mr. Layton, I'm struggling

20 still to understand Justice Kagan's question, the answer

21 to it.

22 How is it that discrimination on the basis

23 of religious exercise is better in selective government

24 programs than general programs, first?

25 And second, how do we tell the difference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
53 1 between the two, if that's the line we're going to draw? 2 The tours, isn't it selective based on who 3 can show up at the Capitol and afford to do that? 4 Public benefit programs, aren't they often selective if 5 you meet criteria? Copyright laws? You have to have an 6 original work, things like that. What do we do about 7 those problems? 8 MR. LAYTON: Well, I -- I still maintain my 9 position that when we have a -- a -- a case where it is 10 a selective program that is publicly announced, publicly 11 visible, that that is different from these other kind of 12 programs. 13 JUSTICE GORSUCH: But how do we draw the 14 line between selective and general? One -- one could 15 seem to play with that line forever. 16 MR. LAYTON: Well, one could, just like the 17 rest of the lines in this case. We don't get a -- a 18 fine line -19 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Well, discrimination on 20 the basis of status of religion, there's no -- no 21 line-drawing problem there. We know that's happened in 22 this case, right? 23 MR. LAYTON: We do know that the decision 24 here was made because it was a church. And assuming 25 that's what "status" means, then I -- I suppose we -- we
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 know that. I mean, that's true.

54

2 JUSTICE BREYER: If you -- if you make that

3 the line, selective versus universal, if you like, you

4 can reproduce the same problems. Volunteer fire

5 departments, most places that the State give grants to

6 upgrade -- upgrade. We don't have enough money, so we

7 have a selection.

8 Same with police. You have crossing guards.

9 You know, you have dangerous intersections. There are

10 crossing guards. We have grants to help the schools pay

11 for the children.

12 Do the same thing with health of children.

13 You know, I can do that. That's what I see as a

14 difficulty, we choose your line there, and we

15 proliferate litigation forever.

16 MR. LAYTON: I -- let me make --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: In areas that are critical,

18 like police, fire, health.

19 MR. LAYTON: Police, fire, and health, when

20 they are universal. But you gave the crossing guard

21 example --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, I --

23 MR. LAYTON: -- and in Missouri, that's

24 not -- that's not universal.

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course. That's my

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 problem. I can reproduce programs in the State that

55

2 seem absolutely necessary for police protection, fire

3 protection, health of children. And it seems like an

4 irrelevant factor, whether they're just open to

5 everybody to apply and you automatically get it, or

6 whether you have criteria and are selected because you

7 have a limited amount of money. And you want to make

8 that line the --

9 MR. LAYTON: Well --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- constitutional line on

11 Free Exercise? I'm afraid of that one. Now, I put that

12 out, so you can reply.

13 MR. LAYTON: Well, the -- and -- and the

14 answer would be that the line is some combination. And

15 I -- I can't give you a bright line, because you're

16 rejecting the bright line that we have. Some kind of

17 combination of the endorsement problems with

18 selectivity, and the entanglement problems that come

19 when we're dealing with grant programs that actually

20 affect the physical plant of a church and how that plant

21 is used in a preschool or otherwise.

22 There is no way for the State to comply with

23 the -- its determination, maybe the requirement, that we

24 police the use of the funds and what the funds here put

25 on there without becoming involved with the church.

Alderson Reporting Company

56 1 There's a statement in the -- the 2 Appellant's brief that says that the church is told that 3 it can't participate in the life of the community, but 4 what Trinity wants is to have the community participate 5 in the life of the church. And that is anathema to the 6 kind of basic doctrines that we get out of the founding 7 era that provided for a division -8 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Imagine, why would it be 9 on the basis of a physical plant, as opposed to, say, 10 personnel or nonphysical grant money? 11 MR. LAYTON: Why -- why wouldn't what be? 12 JUSTICE GORSUCH: Now the line is moving. 13 Now it's apparently on the basis of whether we're 14 granting the money to physical plant or to some other 15 purpose. What is that -16 MR. LAYTON: Well, no, I -- I'm saying that 17 the physical plant is our case, because the physical 18 plant is a -- a -- an improvement to the church property 19 that the church will use and may use for actually 20 proselytizing and not just use it for religious 21 activities. 22 And wherever the line is, that ought to be 23 on the other side of the line, just like wherever the 24 line is, writing a check that says payable to Trinity 25 Lutheran Church ought to be on the other side of the

2 Thank you.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

4 Mr. Layton.

5 Mr. Cortman, you have three minutes

6 remaining.

7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN

8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9 MR. CORTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10 Just three points in rebuttal.

11 First of all, as to the endorsement problem,

12 I think the neutral government criteria here take care

13 of the endorsement problem. So when you have this

14 competitive grant that you have to fill out this -- this

15 pretty complicated application, 16 neutral criteria,

16 there is no endorsement of religion. I think the free

17 speech cases give a good analogue to that.

18 Number 2, as far as the selective or

19 universal government benefit program, I don't think that

20 is really the test here. And the reason, as Your Honors

21 mention, if this was open to all schools, and it was

22 universal, they still would be prohibited from giving a

23 grant to a religious organization. So whether it's a

24 narrow class of all non-for-profits, or a broader class

25 of all schools, they would still not be able to fund

1 based on their constitution.

58

2 And lastly, as we talk about entanglement,

3 this is not an entanglement issue. Entanglement

4 generally is an ongoing, intrusive surveillance. It's

5 not a one-time grant where you have to show a receipt

6 for the expense to receive the reimbursement.

7 If there are no other questions, I yield my

8 time.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

10 The case is submitted.
