3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 this morning in Case 15-1251, National Labor Relations 5 Board v. Southwest General, Incorporated. 6 Mr. Acting Assistant Attorney General. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and 10 may it please the Court: 11 The Vacancy Reform Act's limitation on an 12 individual serving as both the nominee and as the acting 13 official for a single office applies only to someone who 14 is currently the first assistant in that office and is 15 acting pursuant to the automatic service rule set forth 16 in Subsection 3345(a)(1). 17 Both the GAO and OLC adopted that 18 interpretation of the Act shortly after its passage. 19 And in the nearly two decades from passage of the Act 20 until the D.C. Circuit decision here, Presidents of both 21 parties have made scores of nominations and designations 22 based on that interpretation of the text without 23 recorded objection from even a single Senator or staff 24 member. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: General Gershengorn, can I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 ask: As you read this statute, suppose you just took

4

2 out these words "notwithstanding Section" -- "Subsection

3 (a)(1)." What would then the effect of the statute be?

4 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I

5 think that our textual argument would be much more

6 difficult, and the effect of the statute would be

7 effectively to override (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).

8 The "notwithstanding" clause really is the

9 anchor of our textual interpretation. But its strength,

10 I think, comes not only from its text, but also how it

11 fits so well with both the history, structure,

12 contemporaneous interpretation, and practice.

13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But just focusing on text

14 for a minute.

15 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Sure.

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: If that's true, if the

17 entire textual argument really does rest on the

18 "notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)" -- I mean, typically

19 when you have a "notwithstanding" clause, it means, you

20 know, take away Subsection (a)(1), not, you know, close

21 your eyes to Subsection (a)(1). But it doesn't do

22 anything more than that.

23 So why do you think it should be taken to do

24 something more than that in this case?

25 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, we think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
5 1 that because it's a routine application of the expressio 2 unius canon in the context of the "notwithstanding" 3 clause. And so we think it has power for at least three 4 reasons. 5 First -- and we're on pages 82A and 82 -6 83A of the government's brief -- the -- the expressio 7 unius implication is very strong here, because if you 8 read the statute on page 82A, (a)(1) sets out the first 9 assistant rule, (a)(2) sets out the -- the PAS rule for 10 a Senate-confirmed official, and (a)(3) then sets out 11 the act -- the career official or the agency with -12 agency official with substantial service. 13 The very next words in the statute are 14 "notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)." So after (a)(1), 15 (a)(2), and (a)(3), Congress said, "Notwithstanding only 16 (a)(1)." 17 We think the expressio unius counter is 18 particularly powerfully, because Congress could have 19 said, if we're -- we wanted to do a respondens se, 20 notwithstanding subsection (a), but it did not do that. 21 And it's particularly powerful as well, because the 22 "notwithstanding" clause, as Your Honor suggests, is one 23 that Congress uses all the time. Congress will say, 24 notwithstanding any other provision in the code, 25 notwithstanding any other section of the --
Alderson Reporting Company

6 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But can I give you a hypo? 2 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Sure. 3 JUSTICE KAGAN: So the hypo is, I'm at a 4 restaurant, and I -- I'm talking to my waiter, and I 5 place three orders. I say, number 1, I'll have the 6 house salad. Number two, I'll have the steak. Number 7 three, I'll have the fruit cup. And then I tell the 8 waiter, notwithstanding order number three, I can't eat 9 anything with strawberries. 10 So on your theory, the waiter could bring me 11 a house salad with strawberries in it, and that seems to 12 me a quite odd interpretation of what's a pretty clear 13 instruction: No strawberries. 14 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I 15 think this really is fundamentally different for a 16 number of reasons. 17 First of all, we have before us, in contrast 18 to your -- your waiter hypothetical, we have before us 19 the very history of this clause which suggests an 20 interpretation very much in line with the government's 21 interpretation. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: So I -- I take it, you know, 23 you have some arguments, some strong arguments on -- on 24 history and on practice, but, you know, again, I'm just 25 sort of -- isn't that just a peculiar way to understand
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the, you know, notwithstanding order number three, no

7

2 strawberries?

3 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So I don't think it

4 is, Your Honor, and I -- I -- in a footnote, the -- if,

5 for example, you had been a routine -- a regular member

6 of that restaurant -- regular diner at that restaurant

7 and had always understood that you couldn't have

8 strawberries with only one of those things, then the

9 waiter would be justified in interpreting it

10 differently, and we have that contemporaneous practice

11 here.

12 But given Your Honor's textural point only

13 for the moment, I do think that's exactly what this

14 Court held in Preseault, in -- in -- where there was a

15 "notwithstanding" clause, that said, notwithstanding the

16 provisions of the Act, funds -- that you have to rely on

17 advance appropriations, and this Court said, no, that

18 doesn't override the existence of the Tucker Act.

19 I point the Court as well to the case cited

20 in our brief, SEC v. Mount Vernon Memorial Park, which

21 is a situation extremely similar to this, if I could

22 just take a sec on that because I think it will help.

23 That was an interpretation of the Investment Company

24 Act, and it said, "An investment company is an issuer

25 who meets one of the following: (a)(1), (a)(2), and

Alderson Reporting Company

1 (a)(3)."

Official - Subject to Final Review

8

2 And for (a)(3), there was something called a

3 (b)(1) limitation, and it said "Notwithstanding (a)(3),

4 an issuer is" -- "you're not an issuer unless you're in

5 the business of issuing securities." And what the Court

6 said was that the issuer who fell within that

7 limitation, the same (b)(1) limitation, nonetheless was

8 an investment company under (a)(2) precisely because the

9 introductory limitation was limited to notwithstanding

10 (a)(3), and that case is cited in our brief. I think

11 Shomberg is the same.

12 Our point, Your Honor, is not that it is

13 inevitably that way. The expressio unius canon is

14 never -- is -- is a canon. It's an aid to

15 interpretation, and it may be that, for example, in your

16 restaurant hypo, that would be a -- it would be clear

17 from context. But here we really do think that all of

18 the other aids to statutory --

19 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there another

20 explanation for why the "notwithstanding" clause of

21 (b)(1) refers only to (a)(1)? If it -- without that,

22 there would be a direct conflict between (b)(1) and

23 (a)(1) because (a)(1) says "shall," the first assistant

24 shall perform. Whereas (a)(2) and (a)(3) say that the

25 President may do certain things. So there isn't the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 same kind of direct conflict between the remainder of

9

2 (b)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) as there is with respect to

3 (a)(1).

4 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, that

5 is the argument that respondents make, and we simply

6 disagree with that. We think there is a direct conflict

7 between (a)(2), which says the President may appoint

8 this person as an acting, and (b)(1), which says the

9 President may not appoint -- appoint a person as an

10 acting when that person is also the nominee.

11 That (b)(2) is a very -- is a designation

12 and delegation of power to the President to make a

13 designation, and it is every bit as broad as the -- as

14 the (a)(1) example.

15 JUSTICE ALITO: But it's not quite the same

16 kind of conflict. To -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's

17 restaurant scenario and modifying it a bit, if she -- if

18 she were to say, or if I were to say to the waiter, "You

19 may bring me the soup of the day, but you may not bring

20 me soup that contains shellfish because I'm allergic to

21 it," there wouldn't be a conflict of the same sort,

22 would there, between those two statements?

23 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I do

24 think that there -- I do think there would be, and I

25 think in particular, even apart from the restaurant hypo

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 itself, the whole purpose of (a)(2) is to give the

10

2 President the power to make a designation when he

3 believes there's a superior official serving elsewhere

4 in the government. That grant of power is every much

5 restricted by (b)(1) as (a)(1) absent the introductory

6 clause. The -- the (b)(1) says the President may do

7 this. (b)(2) says in some circumstances he may not do

8 this, and that is precisely the kind of conflict that

9 Congress was getting at.

10 But even if you thought the text had some

11 ambiguity here, I really do think that the other aids to

12 statutory construction which this Court's have looked

13 to -- this Court has looked to -- over and over, really

14 do work in our favor and really not at all in

15 Respondent's favor here.

16 The -- principally, if one looks at the

17 contemporaneous interpretation and consistent practice,

18 what one sees is the sponsor of the legislation

19 identified precisely the government's interpretation.

20 Both GAO and OLC adopted that interpretation.

21 President --

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You went into detail

23 without any elaboration. It's just a question, and

24 here's the answer, and there's no reason for the answer

25 from OLC. As far as GAO is concerned, they didn't say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 precisely what happens with category two and three.

11

2 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I

3 think -- so, two points -- a number of points, but two

4 responding directly to both of those.

5 With respect to OLC, our point is not that

6 this Court should defer to it or defer to the reasoning

7 in it. Our point -- our point is, from the very

8 beginning, from the moment the statute was passed,

9 Congress was aware of the interpretation the Executive

10 Branch was putting on it and raised no objection.

11 And with respect to GAO, the GAO letter I

12 think is quite significant because GAO recall under

13 Section 3349 is the Congressionally-designated watchdog

14 for the Vacancies Act, and when GAO issued its letter,

15 which I -- I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, I think

16 the GAO letter is quite clear.

17 If you look at it, what it says is there are

18 four ways to make an acting appointment, and for

19 number 1, (a)(1), it says "And you can't be the

20 nominee."

21 For the other three, it does not have that,

22 and the whole point of that letter was to give guidance

23 to Congress. So that letter was circulated not just to

24 the Senate majority and minority committees, but to the

25 Office of Presidential Personnel, to the White House

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 counsel's office, to OPM and OMB.

12

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you're

3 putting a significant burden on Congress to sort of

4 speak up. There's sort of an estoppel against Congress.

5 If they don't speak up in every instance where they

6 think some prerogative or interpretation is -- is being

7 misapplied or prerogative taken away from them, then

8 there can -- deemed to have acquiesced in it. And this

9 is a context in which that might be particularly

10 inappropriate, because maybe the particular appointment

11 contravenes your -- your theory.

12 But a significant number of people in

13 Congress want to see that vacancy filled, you know,

14 under -- even though it contravenes these more general

15 provisions, and that might not be a particular battle

16 they want to fight at that time. I -- I think it's a

17 very serious burden to impose on the Legislative Branch.

18 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, if --

19 we're not imposing a burden on the Branch, but we are

20 asking you not to turn a blind eye to what really

21 happened in this context.

22 What lead up to the Vacancy Reform Act

23 was -- was decades of Congress raising exactly the kind

24 of objections that one would expect. There were

25 oversight hearings. There were GAO letters. There were

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
13 1 congressional research reports. There were letters back 2 and forth to the Attorney General complaining about the 3 way the Justice Department and the Executive Branch was 4 handling the vacancies, and -- and ignoring the 5 Vacancies Act. 6 Then what we have is an interpretation -7 then what we have is the Vacancies Reform Act and an 8 interpretation set out by the author of the very 9 provision we're talking about, Senator Thompson, and 10 opened discussion by GAO, the watchdog of the Vacancies 11 Act, designated by Congress and by OLC, and then 12 silence. So we're not putting a burden -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have on the other 14 side -- was it Senator Thompson, you have Senator Byrd 15 who seemed to be putting on it the construction that 16 Respondents do. 17 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I 18 think that actually Senator Byrd is quite -- is quite 19 vague about that and omits the "notwithstanding" 20 language. 21 But even if you thought that was sort of a 22 draw, I would note that Senator Byrd, who again was not 23 shy and had weighed in on these Vacancies Act issues, 24 never raised an objection when the -- when Presidents 25 across three administrations continued it into --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sorry. I think it 2 should be noted that, you know, it's one thing to 3 consult legislative history to understand the -- the 4 whole context in which the -- the Congress was acting, 5 but it's quite another thing to rely on an isolated 6 statement and later contradicted by -- by another 7 Senator, and even for those who at times find 8 legislative history helpful, I think this is where it's 9 at its weakest and most unpersuasive. 10 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I 11 disagree -- I don't -- I don't disagree with Your Honor. 12 It is merely one, though, of a consistent stream given 13 the OLC and GAO opinion. 14 So I really would like to get back to the 15 Chief Justice's point, if I could. It is not at all an 16 estoppel by Congress. It is -- the reason why this 17 Court has put -- should put particular weight on this 18 silence here is because it reflects a contemporaneous 19 and uniform interpretation of Congress' understanding of 20 how its own powers are being -- are or are not being 21 infringed. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that -- I'm 23 sorry. 24 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: And given the past 25 history --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
15 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that not -2 how is that not an estoppel? 3 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: It's not an estoppel, 4 Your Honor. What it is, is further evidence that the 5 interpretation of the plain language that we're putting 6 forward is correct. The language supports it. The -7 everybody understood and has acted for 20 years on that 8 assumption. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sounds like the 10 point I was trying to make, is: You are putting weight 11 on the fact that they didn't do anything. And you say 12 you've got other arguments, too, and I appreciate that, 13 but what did they do, then? 14 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Absolutely, Your 15 Honor. No, I am putting weight on what they didn't do. 16 To me, it is very much the dog that didn't bark. 17 Congress had been barking quite loudly and vociferously 18 for decades on this very issue. And then it adopted a 19 statute that was interpreted by its own watchdog in a 20 certain way, and then the barking stopped. And it seems 21 to me this Court is really ignoring reality to not -- to 22 not see that that has important weight. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would be the 24 consequences if we affirm? Your brief didn't list a 25 great parade of horribles. It seems to me that our
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 system is quite capable of accommodating the

16

2 Respondent's argument. And on that point, eight judges

3 have looked at this, and every one of them has come to

4 the conclusion that the Respondent's reached.

5 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I

6 believe there are important consequences.

7 So, first, Congress understood that there

8 are often important positions that don't have first

9 assistants to take over. To cite one at page 11A of the

10 chart, there's an appointment of Linton Brooks, who was

11 a -- who was named as the director in the National

12 Nuclear Security Administration. They're the folks that

13 oversee nuclear counterterrorism.

14 When the Senate-confirmed director of that

15 agency left, there was no first assistant, and the

16 President, President Bush, put in Linton Brooks both as

17 nominee and to act to take over.

18 So Congress was well aware that there often

19 weren't first assistants around.

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you about the

21 consequences going backward?

22 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Yes.

23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Your brief did not talk

24 about this, but do you think that if we find against

25 you, that that subjects to some uncertainty actions that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 these 100-plus officials took?

17

2 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Yes, Your Honor.

3 JUSTICE KAGAN: If so, what actions?

4 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, it

5 does -- and that's the second point to Justice Kennedy's

6 question.

7 It does subject the past officials to

8 substantial uncertainty. In truth, we don't know

9 exactly the extent of it, because we don't know when

10 we'll have defenses of waiver. We don't know when we

11 might, for some things, be able to ratify. But there's

12 no doubt that there are significant reliance interests

13 that the Executive Branch --

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did Judge Henderson

15 say about that? This is not going to be a floodgate

16 situation, because you would have to raise it. Here, it

17 was raised before the ALJ. And for these other cases

18 where the vacancy was long filled, there would be no

19 possibility of making, very late in the day, an argument

20 that you didn't make before.

21 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I'm in

22 a tough position, because I don't want to argue too hard

23 against defenses that we're going to want to assert

24 later. But I do think what Judge Henderson was talking

25 about in particular was the NLRB situation, which is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 different situation, because there are particular

18

2 hearings and the NLRB has an ability to ratify that

3 other agencies don't.

4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose you didn't have

5 those defenses, because, you know, I'm not sure why you

6 would necessarily, given that the statute says they're

7 void ab initio if people take it as against these

8 procedures. So if you didn't have those defenses, as

9 you look down the list of these officials, what kinds of

10 actions are you most worried about being unsettled?

11 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, we

12 have, for example, Adam Szubin, who was the

13 Undersecretary For Terrorism and Financial Crimes. He

14 does the terror-sponsored designations in the Treasury

15 Department. We have the deputy attorney general. We

16 have the head of OPM. These are people who issue -- may

17 issue regulations, who make designations, who make

18 important decisions in the Executive Branch.

19 It is, I think -- the reliance interests of

20 the Executive Branch are quite strong here. This is a

21 situation -- and we have put very senior officials in

22 place at the -- with the understanding that what they

23 were doing based on -- that what they were doing was

24 lawful at the time based on the -- based on the language

25 of the statute and the interpretation provided on it.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I just press you a 2 little bit? 3 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Sure. 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, those are all very 5 important positions that you named, but it's not 6 absolutely clear to me that those -- that there are 7 categories of decisions that those people take that we 8 should be worried about. And if there are, I would like 9 to know about those categories of decisions. 10 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I 11 can't list them chapter and verse. But I do think the 12 kinds of things we're worried about are rulemakings by 13 the heads of agencies, the -- particular designations 14 by -- by the senior officials, and decisions on 15 litigation and other things that may be subject to 16 challenge. 17 We have not gone back and catalogued all of 18 the potential ramifications, but we do think that with 19 over 100 officials over the course of 20 years, the 20 effects of this are really quite significant. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that 100 include or 22 exclude military officers? Do you know? 23 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: It is not including 24 military officers, Your Honor. These are -- these are 25 the acting officials in the Executive Branch, but I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 don't think they're military officials.

20

2 The interpretation that the -- that the

3 Court is putting forward -- if I could make a couple of

4 points on the structure and why we really don't think

5 that this is -- that this is the right way to reason and

6 why our way makes sense -- we think what's reflected in

7 the Vacancies Act is a judgment by Congress that before

8 an individual serves as both the acting and the nominee,

9 that there be one of two protections: that the

10 individual either have been Senate-confirmed before, or

11 that they meet a length-of-service requirement.

12 So in (a)(2), what one sees is that that's

13 in a prior Senate confirmation. In (a)(3), it's a

14 length of service. And if one looks at (c)(1), which

15 addresses Senate-confirmed officials whose terms have

16 expired, again, it's Senate confirmation.

17 The entire purpose of (b)(1) is to extend

18 those protections to first assistants. So what (b)(1)

19 does is, for first assistants, it puts on a

20 length-of-service requirement. And then in (b)(2), it

21 exempts from that length-of-service requirement what --

22 the very individuals who have received prior Senate

23 confirmation. The package works as a seamless whole.

24 Congress was not putting on a

25 first-assistant requirement on a PAS appointee from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 elsewhere in the government, and it was not putting on a 2 first-assistant requirement on a career agency official 3 moved into an acting position. What it was doing was 4 making sure that first assistants who were both nominees 5 and the acting had -- had one of the two protections. 6 It's also consistent with the way the 7 legislative history is, and the drafting history, with 8 respect -- I think this is very important -- to the PAS 9 positions. It had been the President's prerogative 10 expressly under the Vacancies Act, back to 1968, to take 11 a PAS officer and put him into an acting position and 12 then still be able to nominate him. The first draft of 13 the bill preserved that. 14 So after all of the rancor, after all of the 15 unhappiness of the Vacancies Act, the first draft of the 16 bill allowed an acting officer to come in automatically 17 under (a)(1), whereas a PAS under (a)(2), and the (b)(1) 18 restriction, only applied to (a)(1). There's no 19 dispute. 20 And so then what happened? Then there was 21 an objection that the bill didn't give enough authority 22 to the President, and so changes were made to give the 23 President more authority. And what Respondents would 24 have you believe is that Congress overturned sub 25 silentio, without a single complaint, 130 years of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 Executive Branch practice.

22

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why do you -- why and

3 how do you think that that change was made, then?

4 Because the change clearly was made. In the initial

5 draft, it obviously applied only to first assistants;

6 and then in the final draft, not so obvious at all.

7 And, you know, I agree with you there's no explanation,

8 but there is a change.

9 Are you suggesting it was, you know, just a

10 mistake that somehow happened?

11 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Absolutely not, Your

12 Honor. And if you'll bear with me, I can explain that.

13 The initial draft of (a)(1) required a --

14 provided that the person be a first assistant to the

15 officer. And (b)(1) read as it does.

16 When Congress -- Congress changed that to

17 allow the appointment of officers who were not -- who

18 were -- after the officer dies, and so they changed it

19 to first assistant to the office. The significance of

20 that is that somebody could be appointed first assistant

21 even after the vacancy arose. That was a very big

22 change. If Your Honor looks at page 19A of the -- of

23 the Appendix to the petition where the bill is set out,

24 the original bill, the way the bill read, it -- it put

25 the restriction only on the person who was serving at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
23 1 the time of the vacancy. So if the -- if Congress had 2 left (b)(1) the way it was, it would have created a very 3 odd situation where at the current serving first 4 assistant would be subject to (b)(1), and the after put 5 in, that someone put in later, was not subject to 6 (b)(1). 7 So what did Congress do? Congress changed 8 it so that the limitation applied to all first 9 assistants. But then it added "notwithstanding" (a)(1), 10 and that is the critical thing. So in other words, 11 Congress did it, made this change to (b)(1), precisely 12 to deal with the after-appointed first assistants, and 13 then it added the "notwithstanding" clause to say 14 notwithstanding only (a)(1). And so it does seem to me, 15 Your Honor, that it was a very important change. 16 And I think if Your Honor chases -- chases 17 through the legislative history and looks at 19A and way 18 the provision works, you will see that that was the 19 reason -- that that was the reason for the change. 20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you -- if your -- if 21 your interpretation is the correct one, what is your 22 answer to the horrible that appears in the -- in the 23 Respondent's brief at 33 to 34? They say if you read 24 the statute the way the government does, then you could 25 have somebody in there who has never been read --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 approved by Congress, by the Senate. You could have

24

2 someone there upwards of, they calculate, 630 days.

3 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, the

4 response to that is there's no doubt that someone can

5 serve for that length of time, and that Congress

6 understood that. That's the consequence of the time

7 limits in the Vacancies Act.

8 What Respondents are arguing is that should

9 only be true for first assistants but should not be true

10 for -- for individuals that the President appoints

11 under -- designates under (a)(2) and (a)(3). And it's

12 that irrationality that we think the statute -- it's

13 that difference that we think the statute just doesn't

14 justify.

15 So just to be clear: It is -- it is crystal

16 clear under both Respondent's view and our view that an

17 individual can serve for a very long period of time.

18 That's the consequence of the -- of the 210-day --

19 210-day period and the various ways you can extend it.

20 The question before you, though, is whether

21 it makes sense that Congress decided only the first

22 assistants could do that. But there are real reasons to

23 doubt that. (A)(2) and (a)(3) were put in precisely to

24 give the President himself -- and it could only be the

25 President; it's not delegable -- the chance to choose a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 superior -- a superior officer, a better -- a better

25

2 placed, the more talented officer than the first

3 assistant. It seems very odd in that situation to say

4 that the 1100-day scale, or however many days, could

5 only served by the first assistant but not by someone

6 chosen by the President for that very reason under

7 (a)(2) and (a)(3).

8 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,

10 Mr. Gershengorn.

11 Mr. Dvoretzky.

12 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

13 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14 MR. DVORETZKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

15 it please the Court:

16 Four features of the FVRA's text and

17 drafting history compel our interpretation.

18 First, Congress used the broad terms "a

19 person" and "this section."

20 Second, "notwithstanding" is a term of

21 expansion. It does not contract the broad meaning of

22 "person" and "section."

23 Third, the government's interpretation makes

24 Subsection (b)(2) superfluous in multiple ways.

25 And fourth, at the time that Congress added

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
26 1 (b)(2), it deleted language from the initial draft of 2 (b)(1) that expressly limited the provision to first 3 assistants. The revised language encompasses all acting 4 officers. 5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I agree that "person" 6 and "section" are very strong arguments for you. 7 Suppose what the statute said is "notwithstanding (a)(1) 8 and (a)(2)"? And what -- what would then be your 9 argument with respect to whether or not it affected 10 (a)(3)? 11 MR. DVORETZKY: I still think in that 12 circumstance that "person" and "section" would apply to 13 (a)(3). But the reason that that would be a different 14 case is that there is no meaningful distinction between 15 (a)(2) and (a)(3) and the role that they play in the 16 statute. 17 There is a meaningful distinction between 18 (a)(1) on the one hand and (a)(2) and (a)(3) on the 19 other hand. And it makes sense because of that 20 distinction that Congress would single out just (a)(1). 21 JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't get that, 22 Mr. Dvoretzky. And maybe this follows the government's 23 line of thought, but, you know, I've been -- the (a)(1) 24 says, "The first assistant shall be the acting officer." 25 And then (b)(1) says, no, she may not be. Right? And
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
27 1 (a)(2) and (a)(3) doesn't use the words "shall," but it 2 says, the President may appoint any of these people. 3 And then (b) comes along and says, no, the President 4 can't appoint some subset of them. 5 So the basic conflict seems to me to be the 6 same in both cases, which is that the second clause says 7 not so fast, not with respect to those people. 8 MR. DVORETZKY: Justice Kagan, the 9 difference is that (a)(1) is a self-executing provision. 10 It automatically places the first assistant into the 11 vacant office, and (b)(1) then takes the person out. 12 (A)(2) and (a)(3) are grants of discretion that has to 13 be understood side by side with -14 JUSTICE KAGAN: But those grants of 15 discretion are very broad, and then (b)(1) again takes 16 the person out, takes the person out of the grant of 17 discretion, just as it takes the person out of the 18 self-executing provision before them. 19 MR. DVORETZKY: They -- they are broad only 20 if read in isolation, but they can't be read in 21 isolation as a statutory matter. And oftentimes, the 22 President doesn't read them in isolation as a practical 23 matter. 24 In other words, there is no way to avoid the 25 conflict created between (a)(1) and (b)(1) because
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
28 1 (a)(1) puts the person in the job and (b)(1) takes them 2 out. 3 If the President, however, simply reads 4 (a)(2) and (a)(3) together with (b)(1), then he knows 5 what the limitations are on his discretion, and he can 6 avoid that ripping out. It's that ripping out of the 7 nominee from acting service that creates a particularly 8 stark conflict that Congress sought to address through 9 the "notwithstanding" (a)(1) clause. 10 JUSTICE KAGAN: I have to say, I find it a 11 little bit odd to think of this drafter thinking of the 12 kind of distinction you're making. Say, well, this is 13 self-executing and this is not self-executing. It's 14 only a broad grant of discretion. And then not 15 realizing that just by virtue of saying "notwithstanding 16 (a)(1)," the statute creates -- raises this question 17 about, well, you've said (a)(1) but not (a)(2) or 18 (a)(3). What does that mean? 19 I mean, that seems just like a very strange 20 drafter to me, somebody who is so in the weeds that they 21 can't figure out that pretty obvious objection to what 22 they're doing. 23 MR. DVORETZKY: Well, perhaps one way to 24 think of it, and this goes back to your first question 25 of the argument, what if you had a statute that didn't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 have any "notwithstanding" clause at all at the

29

2 beginning of (b)(1)? In that situation it would be

3 clear that "person" and "section" would make (b)(1)

4 applicable to (a)(2) and (a)(3).

5 There would be a question in that situation,

6 though, whether (b)(1) also applied to (a)(1), first of

7 all, because of the starkness of the conflict between

8 (a)(1) and (b)(1), and second of all, the government

9 argues that the general versus specific canon would

10 apply there, but it wouldn't necessarily because the

11 general versus specific canon is typically invoked in

12 order to avoid superfluity where you have one general

13 provision and a specific provision that would be

14 meaningless if not read as an exception to the general.

15 Here, however, in -- in the hypothetical

16 statute without the "notwithstanding" clause, you

17 wouldn't have superfluity concern because (b)(1) would

18 apply to (a)(2) and (a)(3). And so you'd be left with a

19 particular question, not about (2) and (3), but just

20 about (1). And so it makes sense that Congress singled

21 out (1) because of the particular role that it's playing

22 in the statute.

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what about (c)(1)?

24 Isn't, under your reading, it -- it will never be in

25 effect?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 MR. DVORETZKY: No. No, Your Honor. First 2 of all, the officials under (c)(1) are not acting 3 officials. They are receiving term extensions. The 4 language of (c)(1) talks about those individuals 5 continuing to serve in the office. 6 (a)(1) through (3) all talk about performing 7 the functions and duties of the office temporarily in an 8 acting capacity. The legislative history likewise talks 9 about three categories of acting officials, and it 10 consistently talks about (a)(1), (2), and (3). And so 11 (c)(1) is just functioning separately. That's just a 12 different thing. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why aren't (a)(2) and 14 (a)(3) functioning separately from (a)(1)? If -- if 15 (c)(1) can function separately, and that was the thought 16 of the drafters, why don't we carry it to its logical 17 conclusion? (a)(1) is separate from -- they are written 18 almost identically. "The Presidents may direct," "may 19 appoint," may -- they are all sort of exceptions to the 20 rule. 21 MR. DVORETZKY: The reason that (c)(1) 22 functions separately is that it describes the work that 23 the official is doing in a different way. It describes 24 continuing to serve in the office. (a)(1) through 25 (a)(3) all describe the work that the official is doing
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
31 1 in the same parallel way, performing the functions and 2 duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity. 3 That's why the three categories of acting officials are 4 (a)(1) to (a)(3), but (c), by its text, is just doing 5 something different. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why -- the thing -7 I'd like to go back to the Solicitor General's last 8 point, and that's where I'm having -- I have a puzzle. 9 I'd like to hear what you have to say. 10 I mean, for the purposes of this question, 11 I'm assuming all the text, which sounds to me, if a 12 person came from Mars, that's what he would expect a 13 legal argument to be like. 14 The -- the number's all over had the place, 15 and I will also assume that for every chef salad there 16 is a countervailing strawberry shortcake; all right? 17 So -- so everything balances out. Assume. 18 Now, it seems to me that this exception here 19 is saying this. We have the Secretary of the Treasury. 20 He has five assistants. Each is a presidential 21 appointee. One day, secretary -- Assistant Secretary of 22 the Treasury number two dies, and now the President can 23 fill that role with any one of three people on an acting 24 basis: His first assistant, some other assistant 25 secretary or deputy in the treasury department, or a

Official - Subject to Final Review

32

2 Have I got it right so far?

3 MR. DVORETZKY: Yes, Your Honor.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm using examples. All

5 right.

6 Now, what this statute as you read it would

7 seem to say, if you appoint whichever one you choose,

8 put any one of those three people in, go ahead, do it.

9 Now, if you nominate those, one of those three to a

10 presidential position roughly, they are out. All of

11 them are out. Oh, wait. There's one exception. The

12 first assistant is not out if he served for 90 days as

13 first assistant.

14 Have I got the statute right?

15 MR. DVORETZKY: Yes, Your Honor.

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I would just wonder,

17 were I from Mars, what's the point of such a statute?

18 (Laughter.)

19 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it you're perfectly

20 willing to have stay there and do the acting job the

21 first assistant, if he served 90 days before, but you're

22 not willing to have served the acting job this guy who

23 was a GS-18 in the same department, or the person who

24 was an assistant secretary of the Treasury, number two.

25 Why? I can't think of an answer given your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 interpretation.

33

2 I can think of an answer given their

3 interpretation. I say what they were worried about on

4 their interpretation were our friends number two and

5 number three, the GS-18 and the Assistant Secretary

6 number two. They can continue to serve, on their

7 interpretation.

8 Hey, why did they do this? The name of that

9 explanation is called Bill Lann Lee. Because that was

10 the problem that gave rise to the statute, and on their

11 interpretation they passed some words that solved that

12 problem. So there we are.

13 I get an explanation for his, assuming that

14 you like purposes more than you like numbers. I get an

15 explanation on his, and I don't get an explanation on

16 yours. So that's what I would like you to respond to.

17 MR. DVORETZKY: So I'd like to respond,

18 first of all, to why it makes sense to treat first

19 assistants differently, and second of all, to Bill Lann

20 Lee and how that is relevant to the statute.

21 The legislative history explains in multiple

22 places that first assistants are particularly

23 well-suited to be the acting official because they

24 represent continuity and regularity in the office.

25 We know from (b)(1) that Congress was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 concerned with at least some acting service by nominees. 2 And the reason that it created an exception for first 3 assistants, even as nominees, is that they are the least 4 likely to represent change in the agency. It's just the 5 deputy being pushed up one spot, and that's continuity 6 and regularity. 7 On the other hand, particularly when 8 Congress added for the first time in the FVRA this 9 category of GS-15s, potentially thousands of employees 10 within an agency, there's no accountability there to 11 Congress and there are potentially much greater concerns 12 about those individuals serving as acting officials 13 while the nominee. The facts of this case illustrate 14 that concern. 15 The President designated Mr. Solomon to 16 serve as the acting general counsel. Some months later 17 he nominated Mr. Solomon. Perhaps emboldened by the 18 nomination, Mr. Solomon then took some very 19 controversial actions that led the Senate promptly to 20 make clear to the President that this individual was not 21 going to be confirmed. 22 Rather than at that point finding a new 23 nominee, the President allowed Mr. Solomon to continue 24 serving even -- even after the nomination had been 25 returned by the Senate, waited four months before
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
35 1 renominating the same individual, and then only a few 2 months later after that, finally came up with a nominee 3 that the Senate approved. 4 In the meantime, Mr. Solomon served, even 5 though the Senate quite clearly did not consent to him, 6 served in the job for -- for over three years. 7 And so it is that kind of concern about 8 GS-15s that's fundamentally different from a first 9 assistant who represents continuity and regularity in 10 the office. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if Mr. Solomon had 12 been confirmed, you -- you say that that would be all 13 right, even -- even with the erroneous nomination of him 14 while he was acting. 15 But -- so he's confirmed for the permanent 16 office. Yet, under your reading, everything that he did 17 while he was acting is invalidated; is that right? 18 MR. DVORETZKY: Well, it's not necessarily 19 invalidated. It's subject to the defenses that the D.C. 20 Circuit identified at the end of its opinion, but under 21 our reading of the statute, when he was nominated, he 22 needed to step aside and he couldn't serve as the 23 permanent official until the Senate confirmed him. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So his confirmation would 25 be irrelevant to what happens to what was done prior to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 the confirmation?

36

2 MR. DVORETZKY: That's right. His

3 confirmation does not in effect ratify the actions that

4 he took when, in our view, he was improperly serving as

5 an acting official.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- there's one other

7 peculiarity of this. This is why I mentioned the

8 90 days, but a first assistant who is also what they

9 call a PAS, presidentially-appointed,

10 Senatorial-confirmed, such a first assistant without any

11 90 days can simultaneously be acting; and a nominee.

12 But why couldn't the people in category two, that is

13 people who are presidentially-appointed,

14 Senatorially-confirmed in other agencies, why wouldn't

15 the same -- why wouldn't they be treated the same way if

16 the stress is on having someone that the Senate wants

17 approved?

18 MR. DVORETZKY: Because Senate confirmation

19 for one position is not fungible with Senate

20 confirmation for another. When you're talking about a

21 Senate-confirmed first assistant, that again is a

22 combination of Senate confirmation and somebody who's in

23 a first assistant position representing continuity and

24 regularity in the position.

25 Somebody who is confirmed for a completely

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 unrelated Senate position is much more of an end-run

37

2 around the Senate's advice-and-consent role for the

3 vacant office, and the legislative history includes

4 examples -- includes discussion of Congress' concern

5 about PAS officials who are being moved around from one

6 position to the other.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you want to

8 respond to Justice Breyer's point about Mr. Lee?

9 MR. DVORETZKY: I do want to get back to the

10 point about Mr. Lee.

11 The concern about Mr. Lee was not just that

12 he was brought in from the outside at the last minute,

13 which is what the government emphasizes. If that were

14 the concern, Congress could have imposed a restriction

15 on short-serving first assistants as acting officials.

16 Instead, what Congress imposed was a

17 restriction on acting officials -- acting officials who

18 are also the nominee, and there's no reason to think

19 that Congress' concern about nominees serving as acting

20 officials was limited just to first assistants. The

21 text doesn't support that concern, and as the example of

22 Mr. Solomon's own service illustrates, in practice,

23 Congress can have very serious concerns about people

24 outside of the -- the first assistant category serving

25 as the acting official while also the nominees.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 And -- and that's a vivid illustration of 2 the example in our brief of somebody who can serve 3 almost an entire presidential -- presidential term as 4 the permanent -- as the acting official, even though 5 Congress has made clear that the individual is not 6 somebody that -- that the Senate will consent to as the 7 permanent nominee. 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask Mr. Dvoretzky 9 about the post-enactment history? Because, you know, 10 we're generally reluctant to demand that Congress 11 objects to things. 12 But on the other hand, the -- the history 13 here is so strong. All of these appointments, 100-plus 14 of them, in a time when Congress and the President -- I 15 mean, this is -- this has been a time where there's been 16 a lot of partisan bickering over appointments, and you 17 would think that in that context, if anybody had thought 18 that this statute could be read differently, we would 19 have heard about it, and yet we hear absolutely nothing. 20 So how do you explain that? 21 MR. DVORETZKY: Several points in response 22 to that. 23 First, just identifying these FVRA 24 violations is not an easy thing to do. It took the 25 government months of study to do it, and it's an arcane
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 technical issue.

39

2 Second of all, even if Congress had

3 identified the violations, what was it supposed to do

4 about them? If the nominee is somebody that the Senate

5 wants to approve, there's no point in rejecting them

6 based on their past improper service. That's not what

7 the FVRA requires. And doing so would only prolong the

8 vacancy with another acting official that Congress

9 hadn't approved.

10 If Congress doesn't approve of the nominee,

11 odds are it has a reason for doing so that is much more

12 of a headline issue than the FVRA. The FVRA does not

13 make the front page of the Washington Post. It's other

14 objections.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't know. Wouldn't you

16 say something like I don't like this nominee, and

17 anyway, it's illegal for the President to make this

18 nomination?

19 MR. DVORETZKY: You might add that, but it

20 would be a gratuitous addition to what is really the

21 fundamental concern with the nominee.

22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Seems like it gives it some

23 real extra oomph, right?

24 (Laughter.)

25 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not just -- it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 just a matter of my preferences versus the government's 2 preferences. Now the President's preference is illegal. 3 It's off the board. Congress has said he can't do it. 4 Who wouldn't say that in that circumstance? 5 MR. DVORETZKY: Somebody who then was going 6 to be pressed and had to explain the technicalities of 7 why the appointment was illegal. 8 (Laughter.) 9 JUSTICE BREYER: You -- you have been -- and 10 I understand -- you've been concerned about instances in 11 which there is controversy over appointment. But there 12 are thousands of jobs in the government where they have 13 to run departments where there's no controversy, you 14 know. 15 And people leave, or they die, or something 16 happens; there's a vacancy. And the main institutional 17 imperative is keep the job being done. Keep the office 18 working. So an obvious person is to say Mr. First 19 Assistant, you carry on. Okay? And maybe you bring in 20 somebody from next door. And maybe you look for a GS-18 21 in the department. You know, the guy next door has a 22 presidential appointment. So you put him in the job. 23 That's all. No problem. 24 And why all of a sudden Congress would, in 25 these thousands of instances where there's no problem,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 or hundreds anyway, Congress would say, if you decide to 2 appoint him permanently, you have to take him 3 immediately out of the acting position, and there's more 4 disruption in the department. Why would anyone want to 5 do that? 6 Now, I could see they might want to do it 7 with the first assistant where it's a runaround, and 8 they have an idea that it's a runaround when he hasn't 9 served as first assistant for more than 90 days. Then 10 you might say, well, why him? Maybe they were just 11 trying to get this controversial guy in. 12 In other words, as -- as an administrator in 13 noncontroversial matters, I can understand their 14 interpretation more easily. But you will tell me that 15 I'm wrong because? 16 MR. DVORETZKY: The -- the first assistant 17 restriction in (b)(1) reflects that Congress clearly was 18 concerned about some acting officials who are also the 19 permanent nominee. Congress saw that as a particular 20 affront to its advice and consent role, and that 21 exemplifies a lot of the problems that led to the 22 enactment of the FVRA in which the Presidents -23 Presidents of both parties were putting in their 24 ultimate choice for a position long term without Senate 25 confirmation.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
42 1 There's no reason to think that that concern 2 is limited only to first assistants coming in from the 3 outside. Those concerns are equally applicable to any 4 of the thousands of GS-15 employee within an agency. 5 And it's not surprising that, in the same set of 6 revisions when Congress added (a)(3), it made -- made 7 those GS-15s eligible to serve, that it also thought, 8 well, perhaps this has the potential for mischief. 9 Perhaps this has the potential to allow just as much of 10 an end -- of a runaround of our advice-and-consent role 11 as the first assistants. 12 Likewise, with respect to the PAS officials, 13 it's true that PAS officials had previously been able to 14 serve as both permanent nominees and acting officials, 15 but the FVRA rethought this entire area of vacancies. 16 And it's not surprising that, while -- while Congress 17 was also prohibiting GS-15s, this new category from 18 serving as acting officials while nominees, that it also 19 swept in the (a)(2)s as well. 20 There's also a practical point about how 21 this actually operates. Much of the time, over 22 30 percent of the time, the President nominates and 23 designates, either at the same time, or -- or the 24 President nominates first and designates second after 25 apparently becoming impatient with the confirmation

43

2 And so, Justice Breyer, your hypothetical --

3 your hypothetical was asking why does it make sense to

4 take the official out of the job once they are

5 nominated? Often that doesn't even happen. Often the

6 President is nominating the person and then making them

7 the acting official later. So you're not taking the

8 person out of the job.

9 Moreover, our interpretation of the statute

10 removes one person from the pool of acting officials.

11 There -- there is not -- this is not a situation where

12 we are taking out the thousands of GS-15s or PAS

13 officials. There are lots of people available to serve.

14 We're taking out the one person that reflects the

15 biggest affront to Congress' advice-and-consent role if

16 allowed to serve while also nominating.

17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And defeating the

18 efficient running of the department at the same time,

19 because if the person has been running the department,

20 now you're going to put it through a second dislocation

21 of having that person removed and somebody else step in.

22 MR. DVORETZKY: Again, in practice, over a

23 third of the time, that doesn't happen. It's also

24 something that the --

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It hasn't happened

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 because no one's read it the way you have and

44

2 invalidated that person's actions so far.

3 MR. DVORETZKY: Well, no. What I mean is if

4 you look at the government's chart, a third of the time,

5 even if you applied our interpretation, it would not

6 result in the nominee being taken out of acting service

7 because the nominee isn't even put into acting service

8 until later or at the same time as the nomination.

9 Moreover, the President --

10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Senate is taking a

11 long time to confirm, even when they're not objecting.

12 MR. DVORETZKY: So in -- in this particular

13 case, after Mr. Solomon had served for some

14 two-and-a-half years, when the President put up a

15 permanent nominee, the Senate confirmed him in a matter

16 of months. And so the Senate doesn't always take a long

17 time.

18 Moreover, the Senate has confirmed

19 approximately 85 percent of PAS officials during the

20 current President's administration. And so the Senate

21 is confirming these officials. What the FVRA requires

22 is that the official not do the job without Senate

23 confirmation because that would recreate the very

24 problems that the FVRA was intended to combat in the

25 first place.

45 1 There's a limited exception for long-serving 2 or Senate-confirmed first assistants, but that makes 3 policy sense because of the continuity and the 4 regularity that they bring to the job. 5 I'd like to address the -- the question that 6 was raised earlier about the consequences of ruling in 7 our favor retroactively in terms of past decisions. 8 No court has considered the "no force and 9 effect" language. But what I can tell you is that the 10 government has been shoring up a defense that would be 11 tied to the language in 3348 about the functions and 12 duties of a particular office. The only actions that 13 have no force and effect are those that are taken in the 14 performance of a function and duty of a vacant office. 15 In response to a Senate inquiry about a 16 deputy EPA administrator who had been serving for two 17 years, the EPA took the position that that individual 18 had not taken any actions whatsoever that were actually 19 tied to the functions or duties of the vacant office. 20 On the GAO website, there are approximately 21 two dozen reports of time violations over the years of 22 the FVRA. And the GAO reports that agencies had 23 reported to it that none of those two dozen individuals 24 who served in violation of the FVRA took any actions 25 that were tied to the functions and duties of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 office. And so the government is already shoring up

46

2 arguments for why the "no force and effect" language

3 would not undo actions taken by these improperly pointed

4 officials.

5 With respect to the GAO, the -- the Acting

6 Solicitor General referred to the GAO as a watchdog --

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: The way you described that,

8 you sound a bit skeptical of those defenses.

9 (Laughter.)

10 MR. DVORETZKY: Well, skeptical only in the

11 sense that they're not at issue in this case, and they

12 haven't been litigated. But if it were, if ruling in

13 our favor were going to lead the sky to fall, you would

14 expect the government to -- to tell you that. And not

15 only has the government not told you that, but the --

16 the surrounding context shows that the government thinks

17 it has pretty good arguments for why.

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you say that you can

19 bring those cases, too?

20 MR. DVORETZKY: I'm sorry?

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Telling us -- so that --

22 you can bring those cases, too, or for other people to

23 bring them? They're in a real catch-22 situation.

24 MR. DVORETZKY: The fact is, though, it's

25 their burden to show the consequences of their actions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
47 1 And the government's track record on this shows just the 2 opposite; shows that these officials supposedly are not 3 doing anything that would actually be invalidated. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So is Mr. Solomon's case 5 atypical, the general counsel to the NLRB? 6 MR. DVORETZKY: Well, it's atypical in the 7 sense that it is, under 3348(e), the "no force and 8 effect" language doesn't apply to the general counsel of 9 the NLRB. It's -- the -- his actions are only voidable 10 rather than void, and that's why the D.C. Circuit looked 11 to the harmless error doctrine and the de facto officer 12 doctrine as additional defenses. 13 But even in a case where the "no force and 14 effect" language did apply, again on the government's 15 theory, challengers would have to show that the actions 16 were -- that the actions that were taken were ones that 17 could only have been taken by an individual in the 18 vacant office. And the government doesn't believe that 19 that happens very much. 20 With respect to the cases that the 21 government cites for the first time in its reply brief, 22 none of those are on point. The Preseault case, the -23 the operative language there was "under this act." 24 That's what made clear that the particular provision 25 there applied only to the statute at issue and not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 separately to the Tucker Act.

48

2 The Mount Vernon case out of the Ninth

3 Circuit, interpreting the "notwithstanding" clause --

4 the -- the language in the "notwithstanding" clause

5 there to apply to all of (a) would have created

6 superfluity which is not the case here. To the

7 contrary, here the government's interpretation makes

8 (b)(2) superfluous.

9 Congress specifically added (b)(2) when it

10 expanded (b)(1) to apply to more than just first

11 assistants, and if (b) -- if (b)(1) did not apply to all

12 of (a) in the first place, there would be no need under

13 (b)(2) to create an exception for Senate-confirmed first

14 assistants. Those Senate-confirmed individuals could

15 serve under (a)(2), anyway. So the only reason that

16 Congress would have had to add that (b)(2) was because

17 (b)(1), pursuant to these -- the changes to the

18 statutory language otherwise applied to all of (a).

19 The government argues in its reply brief

20 that (b)(2) serves the -- serves a purpose because it

21 saves the President from having to designate someone

22 under (b)(2). That's not a plausible account that

23 Congress would have gone to all the trouble of adding

24 (b)(2) solely to achieve that goal.

25 And -- and, again, I would return to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 core language here, which is "person" and "section."

49

2 Those are broad inclusive terms. If Congress had meant

3 to accomplish what the government argues that this

4 statute is accomplishing --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that the argument,

6 is that language, "person" and "this section," were in

7 the prior bill, where it -- it applied only to first --

8 What do you call it?

9 MR. DVORETZKY: Only to first assistants.

10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- first assistants?

11 MR. DVORETZKY: Because -- because the --

12 that's true, but the language in the prior bill had an

13 old version of (b)(1) -- this is, again, at 19A of the

14 cert petition -- that made clear that the only persons

15 we were talking about were persons who are serving as

16 first assistants. There was immediate qualifying

17 language that made clear and narrowed what "person"

18 meant.

19 Congress specifically deleted that language

20 and it added a new (b)(2) that would be unnecessary if

21 (b)(1) applied only -- if (a)(1) applied -- I'm sorry --

22 if (b)(1) applied only to (a)(1).

23 If Congress had simply meant to achieve in

24 the draft what the government ascribes to it, the edits

25 could have been much simpler. It could have simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
50 1 changed 180 days to 90 days in order to shorten the -2 the required period of acting service, and it could have 3 edited the existing (b)(1) to say, such person serves in 4 the position of first assistant to the office of such 5 officer. It made much broader changes. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 7 Four minutes, Mr. Gershengorn. 8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 10 GENERAL GERSHENGORN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 11 Justice. I'd like to make a number of points. 12 First, Justice Kagan, your account of what 13 would have happened in Congress had there been any 14 reason to believe there was a problem with the Executive 15 was doing is exactly right, and we know that because 16 after the D.C. Circuit ruled, in fact, what you said 17 would happen is what happened. 18 Senators started raising objections to the 19 President's nominees, arguing that they were serving 20 illegally. That's what happened in the years prior to 21 the Act, and that's what happened as soon as the D.C. 22 Circuit ruled. That in-between period, I submit, is 23 very significant. 24 Justice Sotomayor, you raised Section 25 (c)(1). I think you're exactly right. What their
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
51 1 reading of the statute does is read the notwithstanding 2 (a)(1) to mean notwithstanding (a)(1) -- to mean that it 3 applies to (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), but not (c)(1). 4 I think that's a very odd thing to express with the term 5 "notwithstanding (a)(1)." 6 Justice Breyer, you were asking about why it 7 would make sense to treat the (a)(2) and (a)(3) 8 differently, and I think you're exactly right. It does 9 not. 10 What Respondent said was there needs to be 11 accountability to Congress. Congress put in that 12 accountability. It said that these individuals under 13 (a)(2) and (a)(3) need to be personally designated by 14 the President. It cannot be delegated. That is the 15 kind of responsibility that when Congress puts that in 16 the President, this -- it's not surprising then that 17 those folks should be able to serve while they are 18 nominated because they have gotten not only a Senate 19 confirmation or long-standing agency service, but the 20 personal approval of the President. 21 Counsel tried to distinguish the cases that 22 we raised. I think they are worth raising because it 23 does change, I think, the way this -- this Court has 24 read the "notwithstanding" clause the way we say it. 25 Preseault is a perfect example. It said,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
52 1 notwithstanding this Act, but Congress then didn't read 2 the remainder of clause to provide -- to apply to the 3 whole code. It limited to the Act, which was what was 4 specified in the "notwithstanding" clause. We think 5 that that's what this Court should do here. 6 And then finally I'd like to address this, 7 the treatment of PAS officers, which I think is really 8 important. What Respondent said was, oh, Congress swept 9 in (a)(2) as well. With that blithe assertion, he 10 attributes to Congress the intent to overturn 130 years 11 of practice that had raised no complaint. There is no 12 evidence anywhere in the congressional record that 13 Congress was concerned about Senate-confirmed officials 14 also -- who were also nominated, and it was not 15 reflected in the initial draft. The idea that Congress 16 blithely did that and swept in (a)(2), I think is just 17 not supported by the record. 18 And I'm sorry. One more point. One final 19 point. Justice Ginsburg, I think you're exactly right 20 on the person/section point, which Justice Kennedy also 21 had raised. That language was in the prior bill. There 22 is no doubt that the provision it was in applied -23 applied in addition to only -- applied only to first 24 assistants. And our point is that "person" and 25 "section," of course it's broad. But all that does is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 set up the conflict. Congress understood that.

53

2 So how did it resolve the conflict? Not in

3 the most natural way under -- that Respondent would have

4 this Court understand, by saying, notwithstanding

5 Subsection (a), which would have taken out all of the

6 problem. Instead it said, notwithstanding

7 Subsection (a)(1). And the idea that Congress did that

8 because there was no conflict between (a)(2) and (a)(3)

9 and -- and (b)(1) just doesn't hold water.

10 Finally, on that point -- I know that's my

11 third finally, and I apologize, Your Honor. But the --

12 it does seem that the notwithstanding (a)(1) doesn't do

13 any work in their reading. If Congress had just said

14 (a)(1), and then had had (b)(1) without the

15 "notwithstanding" clause, this Court would have

16 understood (b)(1) to be a limitation on (a)(1)'s

17 authority without a doubt. And so what "notwithstanding

18 (a)(1)" does is specify the order of operations, to

19 specify the provision that is overridden. And this

20 Court should give that -- that congressional decision

21 respect.

22 Thank you.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

24 The case is submitted.
