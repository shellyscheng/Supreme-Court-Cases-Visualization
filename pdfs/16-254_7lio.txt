3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:22 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in case 16-254, Water Splash v. Menon. 5 Mr. Gaston. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY GASTON 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. GASTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 At issue in this case is whether The Hague 11 Service Convention permits service of process by mail if 12 the State of destination does not object. Our position 13 is that such mail service is allowed, and it's a 14 three-part argument. 15 First, purely textual evidence of meaning 16 shows that this reading of the treaty is at least 17 reasonable. 18 Second, some additional considerations, 19 namely, this Court's decision in Schlunk, as well as the 20 history of events leading up to the treaty, further 21 confirm that this is a reasonable reading of 22 Article 10(a). 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, your adversary 24 basically starts from the proposition that this text is 25 unambiguous.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 MR. GASTON: Yes.

4

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you agree with that

3 proposition?

4 MR. GASTON: No. We do not agree the text

5 is wholly unambiguous. We believe the text begins as

6 very ambiguous. Looking at Article 10(a), (b), and (c),

7 where (a) uses the word "send," (b) and (c) use the word

8 "effect service." And instantly, just looking at that

9 small area, one says, well, wait, what does "send" mean

10 here? Does it mean send to serve? Send for nonservice?

11 Send for both purposes? Is it the same or different

12 than to effect serve?

13 And we have a presumption that has been used

14 in the statutory context the different words are usually

15 going to mean different things. It's not a irrebuttable

16 presumption, but even that presumption leaves ambiguity

17 because it --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So why do

19 you think the drafters used those two different phrases?

20 What's your best answer?

21 MR. GASTON: The -- -- the -- the best --

22 there's a practical answer and then there's a -- a legal

23 answer.

24 The practical answer -- and this involves

25 the circumstances leading up to the treaty -- is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 there were three prior treaties dating back to 1896,

5

2 where a French term "addressee" was used in the

3 analogous provision, and that, in French, was also not a

4 term of art for "service."

5 There were two other French terms of art for

6 "service," and the convention used "nova casiam" and

7 "signif casiam" as terms for service. And then in this

8 section, which was 6(1) of the earlier treaties, at

9 least of the 1954 treaty, it used the term "addressee."

10 And in context, it was very clear that it meant

11 "service" because there were other references to

12 "service" later in that section, and it was understood

13 to mean "service" because the term in French was broad

14 enough to cover "service."

15 And what happened in 1964, during the

16 drafting of the treaty adopted in 1965, they had to

17 prepare, for the first time, an English version of the

18 treaty. Because they would have two texts, French and

19 English, and, as a practical matter, what they did is

20 they took that language and simplified the article to

21 which it would be part of, and it lost some of its

22 context.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it -- is it fair to say

24 that your first argument, you were talking about the

25 first argument text, but then it seems to me that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 went a little bit beyond text.

6

2 Is one of your arguments that maybe "send"

3 is ambiguous when you look at (a), but when you look at

4 (b) and (c), you know why they used the word "send" and

5 so it's not ambiguous -- even though it's ambiguous, the

6 much better interpretation is your interpretation, just

7 by looking at (a), (b), and (c)?

8 Is that your argument? Is that your first

9 argument?

10 MR. GASTON: No. The first argument is that

11 all -- there -- there is quite a bit of textual evidence

12 beyond (a), (b), and (c) that suggests "send" in

13 Article 10(a) means "serve" --

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

15 MR. GASTON: -- despite a presumption that

16 different words usually mean different things. And --

17 and that first happens as you draw outward from (a),

18 (b), and (c) to Article 10 as a whole, which has a right

19 of objection by a State of destination.

20 So states that are party to the treaty can

21 object to Article 10(a) or 10(b) or 10(c). And if 10(a)

22 means "send" for nonservice purposes, it's basically

23 saying, okay, you can send these judicial documents for

24 unofficial, nonlegal, nonbinding purposes, unless the

25 State of destination objects.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 JUSTICE ALITO: There's a body of law, a 2 body of international law regarding the way in which 3 treaties should be interpreted, and there are certain 4 rules about the interpretation of treaties. But 5 treaties are also the law of the United States. So the 6 question that you started out answering is a rule for 7 interpreting laws of the United States. 8 So what do we do in a situation where there 9 might be a conflict between these two bodies of 10 interpretive standards? 11 MR. GASTON: And -- and I think, luckily, 12 this case I don't think rings up the conflict, because 13 the only way you remove the ambiguity in a -- in a way 14 against Petitioner's position is to take a canon that 15 words usually mean different things and make it 16 irrebuttable, and that's -- that's not the law under -17 under Federal law. This Court has -- has not applied 18 that canon in some situations. 19 And here, you -- you get to a greater 20 meaning by -- and if I could carry out the answer to 21 the -- the State of destination objecting -- it would be 22 very odd to put in a treaty about service, some 23 provision that -- to allow states to object to the use 24 of their mails for unofficial purposes. 25 It -- it really -- I think most people would
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
8 1 say: Well, before the treaty I could use the mail for 2 unofficial purposes; after the treaty, I ought to be 3 able to use the mail for unofficial purposes. 4 And even the -- the delegates of members who 5 have met in the years after the treaty have said: Yes, 6 even if a State objects or not, you can certainly use 7 the mail for -- for unofficial purposes because that 8 doesn't affect any sovereign interest of the State. 9 They don't have a -- a need to object. 10 That structural argument, which is part of 11 Federal law looking at the structure of treaties, is 12 enough, I would -- I would say, by itself to drastically 13 reduce the ambiguity here. And then any remaining 14 nearly textually vanishes when you think about the 15 entire treaty as a whole, which is it's a treaty on 16 service. 17 The title is the Convention on the Service 18 Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents. The 19 preamble discusses simplifying service, expediting 20 service, making service more reliable. 21 And in -- in that context, I think the best 22 that -- that -- that Respondent can get to is the idea, 23 well, maybe there's still some remaining ambiguity, 24 because it certainly seems that -- that send here is 25 a -- a rule of service. And we have domestic examples
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
9 1 where rules of service, after they've made clear we're 2 talking about service, they use common verbs of 3 transmission: Send, deliver, mail. In Texas, you can 4 effect service by mailing and so the verb is -- is 5 "mail." In -- in that context, the word "send" in 6 Article 10(a), although this is -- is a legal argument, 7 this is not practically what happened, but -- but send 8 is a -- is a perfect word for the directness of the 9 transmission. 10 Every other transmission in the treaty 11 requires some sort of intermediary, whether it's a 12 central authority, a consulate or a diplomatic 13 individual or channel or a judicial officer in -- in the 14 State of destination. When you're talking about sending 15 through the mail, serving documents, you send them, and 16 it's the only case where you can directly effectuate 17 service. 18 The -- the other of -- in terms of -- in 19 terms of text still, the context of certain other words 20 also shows that send is used and meant as service. 21 There are three channels, other than the central 22 authority, that are mentioned in the treaty: Diplomatic 23 channels, postal channels and consular channels. All 24 three use the word "channels." And that's in Articles 9 25 and 10.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 And then later, in Article 11, it talks about channels 2 of transmission. And then later in Article 21, it 3 speaks of more generally methods of transmission. And I 4 think these are also contextual evidence that all the 5 channels that have been discussed are service channels. 6 And then, finally, the -- if -- if there is 7 any ambiguity remaining, the extrinsic evidence that 8 this Court has said we can consider, at least absent 9 wholly unambiguous text, is overwhelmingly in support of 10 the idea that, in fact, at the time of drafting, the -11 the drafters and those who adopted it at that convention 12 intended to allow service by mail. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been a number 14 of countries that have said: We don't want you to use 15 mail. They have taken that option. 16 MR. GASTON: Yes. I have counted -17 actually, of the 71 countries who have either acceded or 18 ratified the treaty, nearly half, 30, have expressed 19 their objection to -- to mail by lodging a declaration 20 with the government of the Netherlands. And there are a 21 handful who have lodged a qualified objection where they 22 say, well, yes, mail is okay, but if you do it this 23 particular way. 24 So, yes, certainly that number indicates 25 that. And in some cases, such as Canada, in this case
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 their declaration -- who doesn't object -- specifically 2 states, we understand. We are saying we don't object to 3 service by mail. And that's not in every case, but -4 but several -- several of the declarations. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have positively said we 6 don't object. 7 MR. GASTON: Yes. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if you -- you are 9 right, does Menon, does she get any chance to defend on 10 the merits? Or if she suffered a default judgment, is 11 that it? 12 MR. GASTON: In -- in general, that is not 13 it because the convention has two provisions in Articles 14 15 and 16 that enable a person to -- to potentially void 15 a judgment or to extend the time to appeal if certain 16 conditions are shown. Whether that could be introduced 17 in a enforcement proceeding, for example, in Canada, if 18 the judgment were sought to be enforced, if I were on 19 the other side, I would be trying to argue Articles 15 20 and 16 and try and -- and try and show there was a 21 problem with the judgment. But at least in this -- the 22 forum State, I think if -- if those articles are not 23 raised at the default judgment stage or within a 24 reasonable time after the judgment -25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The articles. What are

1 the articles?

12

2 MR. GASTON: Articles 15 and 16.

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, what do they say?

4 MR. GASTON: So Article 15 precludes the

5 entry of a default judgment depending on whether the

6 forum State -- and in this case, that's the

7 United States -- whether they have opted to go in the

8 first half of Article 15 or the second half of

9 Article 15.

10 The first half of Article 15 based --

11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does the person

12 get to raise the defense that they didn't actually

13 receive notice?

14 MR. GASTON: They can certainly raise it in

15 the -- in the proceeding where the judgment was entered

16 within a reasonable time after they got actual notice of

17 the judgment. And that's Article 16 specifically. They

18 have to show they didn't have notice, they have to show

19 they had a prima facie defense, and then they could get

20 relief from the finality of it.

21 And if the Court has no further questions, I

22 would reserve the remainder of my time.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
13 1 FOR UNITED STATES, AMICUS CURIAE, 2 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 3 MS. GOLDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 4 it please the Court: 5 Article 10(a) of the Hague Service 6 Convention permits service through postal channels on 7 persons abroad if the law of the forum State -- that's 8 the State where the case is pending -- authorizes such 9 service and if the receiving State where the mail will 10 be delivered hasn't objected to Article 10(a). 11 And I'd like to start with this permit 12 authorize framework, because I think there's been a lot 13 of confusion in the lower courts on this subject. The 14 question presented here is perhaps phrased a little 15 inartfully in terms of authorization, and it would be 16 really helpful if this Court would clarify this point. 17 Article 10(a) says that provided the State 18 of destination does not object, the present convention 19 shall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial 20 documents by postal channels to persons abroad. So it 21 is not interfering with freedom. It is -- it's not the 22 same thing as providing an affirmative authorization for 23 service by mail. That affirmative authorization has to 24 be found elsewhere. And the place where you find it is 25 in the law of the forum State.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 So, for instance, in our Federal system, if 2 you look at Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 3 there is a subsection of Rule 4 that says where an 4 international agreement permits, but does not authorize 5 service on persons abroad, here are a bunch of things 6 you can do. And some of those options include service 7 by mail, using registered mail by -- sent by the clerk 8 of the court, service by mail if the district court 9 judge in a particular case directs it, and so on. 10 So that's where you get the authorization. 11 You have to -- the forum State has to authorize the 12 service by mail on a person abroad. 13 At the other end of the process, you have to 14 see whether the receiving State has objected to service 15 by mail. And as my friend indicated, nearly half of the 16 countries that have acceded to or ratified this treaty 17 have indeed objected to service by mail. Some of them 18 have given a sort of conditional objection that they'll 19 only service by mail if -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they -21 MS. GOLDENBERG: -- it's done in a certain 22 way. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they make a 24 distinction, any of them, between the initiating 25 document, the complaint, as distinguished from documents
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 later on in the litigation?

15

2 MS. GOLDENBERG: None of them do, no. None

3 of the -- the statements that countries have made when

4 they've stated whether they object to Article 10(a) or

5 not simply state either we object to service by mail or

6 we don't. Some of them don't actually use the word

7 "service." Many of them do; more than -- more than half

8 of them do. Some States that have not objected have

9 also used the word "service" when they've made that

10 statement. So I think that is an indication -- one of

11 many indications that other contracting parties to this

12 convention, like the United States itself, understand

13 that Article 10(a) is about service and not simply about

14 some kind of informational mailing.

15 So as I said before, we think it would be

16 helpful if the Court would clarify the -- the permit,

17 authorize, object framework. The court of appeals

18 decision that we think best captures this is the

19 Brockmeyer decision from the Ninth Circuit, which lays

20 this out correctly and also has a very helpful

21 discussion of how Rule 4 interacts with the treaty.

22 Beyond that, as my friend said, there are a

23 lot of textual indications here that this is a

24 convention that is about service. Just to highlight one

25 that he didn't touch on, there's a structural argument,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
16 1 which is that Articles 8, 9, 10(b), 10(c), 11 are all 2 about alternative channels for service, and it would be 3 very odd for this convention to suddenly jump to 4 something that wasn't about service in Article 10(a) and 5 then jump back again to service in 10(b), 10(c), and 11. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why do you think they used a 7 different word? 8 MS. GOLDENBERG: I think my friend correctly 9 gave the reasons, which is there is a historical reason 10 and a practical reason. The historical reason is that I 11 think they simply carried over the French word 12 "addresser" from the 1954 civil procedure convention 13 that replaced -- that this convention replaced as to 14 States that were parties to both. Addresser had been 15 understood by everyone and it was clear in context to 16 capture service. And so I think if you actually compare 17 the language of the 1954 treaty and the language of 18 Article 10(a) in French, they are virtually identical. 19 It was just the drafters carried it over. And that 20 that's the way that people understood it. 21 On a practical level I do think that "send" 22 is just a very natural way to refer to putting something 23 in the mail, and so it makes sense to use that verb 24 there rather than a different verb, especially when 25 you're talking about a situation in which the service
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 can go directly from one party to another.

17

2 We think the contrary interpretations really

3 don't work here, but at the very least there's ambiguity

4 in this treaty, and at that point this Court's decisions

5 are clear; you turn to extrinsic sources of information.

6 Here, each and every extrinsic source points strongly in

7 the direction of the interpretation we're espousing.

8 You have the -- the history, and that is the draft

9 convention and the contemporaneous understanding of

10 people who were there when it was drafted. You have the

11 consistent interpretation of the executive, which is

12 entitled to great weight, and here, has been completely

13 consistent from the beginning till now. You have the

14 consistent interpretation of other contracting parties,

15 which this Court has said are entitled to considerable

16 weight, and you also have an expert consensus among

17 scholars and so on.

18 So affirming the court below would take us

19 out of step with the rest of the world. 70 other

20 countries are parties to this treaty -- to this treaty,

21 and it could believe an irritant if they think that

22 we're not living up to our obligations.

23 It also would make service more difficult

24 for U.S. plaintiffs who are looking to serve defendants

25 who are abroad. It would take away from them the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 ability to use the mails in situations where they might 2 be trying to serve someone in a country where the 3 central authority is slow or expensive. And so for all 4 those reasons, we think that the Court should reverse 5 the judgment below. 6 If the Court has no further questions. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 Mr. Hootman. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. HOOTMAN 10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 11 MR. HOOTMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 12 please the Court: 13 Before I get into the -- into the thrust of 14 my argument, I'd like to address a couple of questions 15 that came up here. 16 Why is -- was a different word used, okay? 17 The lead scholar on this, which is cited to in both 18 the -- the Solicitor General's brief and my -- my 19 opponent's brief, Bruno Ristau, he's -- he's the 20 acknowledged expert in this whole area of -- of 21 extrajudicial service. In his two-volume treatise, 22 he -- he says -- he goes through all this talk, all this 23 analysis about all these different cases that -- on this 24 very issue, and then in the -- in -- in sum, he says 25 it's a mistake. It was -- I call it -- I call this case
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 the case of Bartleby, the Scrivener, because it turns on 2 this mistake that the lead scholar says that is out 3 there. 4 And so if -- if you look at the -- the 5 obvious section of the treaty on page 8 of the Joint 6 Appendix, under the mistake -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I think that 8 leading scholar -- maybe I'm wrong, but I thought I read 9 it, thought that it -- that it may have been the 10 scrivener's mistake, but the intent was clearly to 11 effect service by the -12 MR. HOOTMAN: It clearly comes down on -- on 13 their side of the camp. That -- that's undoubtedly. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this leading scholar 15 calls it a misuse of words, but that the intent was 16 clear in -- for all the reasons everyone else is giving? 17 MR. HOOTMAN: Exactly. And it also uses a 18 similar analysis that the dissenting opinion in the 19 Texas Court of Appeals said. Basically, you look at all 20 these other things out there beyond the text to -- to 21 come up -22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why is this clear? 23 Your adversary says isn't the lack of clarity inherent 24 in the question; what do they mean by "send"? They 25 don't define "send." They don't define "service." So
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
20 1 doesn't that automatically create an ambiguity? And why 2 isn't the ambiguity approached the way the other side 3 says? 4 MR. HOOTMAN: Okay. First of all, I do not 5 think that there is an ambiguity in -- in this 6 particular point that we're all here talking about. And 7 I -- and I say that for the reasons that were cited 8 basically in the Fifth Circuit opinion, but that whereas 9 if you take the words to "effect service" -- or 10 actually, "effect service of" -- and substitute those 11 for "send," then -- then it is crystal clear for them. 12 So then if you use the -- I don't really 13 think it's a canon. I think it's more of a rule of 14 usage, that if I alter the -- the word that I'm using 15 throughout a document for something else, well, then I'm 16 just trying to alter the -- the message that I'm 17 sending. 18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a convention on the 19 service of documents? It's not a convention about 20 sending documents, but it's a convention -- everything 21 in this convention relates to service, and the whole 22 purpose of it was to facilitate international 23 cooperation in litigation. 24 MR. HOOTMAN: No doubt about it. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so just -- just as
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 in -- in this case, the service is sought to be made in 2 Canada, there will be cases where courts abroad want to 3 serve somebody in the United States. The whole purpose 4 of this was to make it easier to conduct litigation, 5 international -- to facilitate international cooperation 6 in litigation. 7 MR. HOOTMAN: No doubt about it. And I 8 would -- and I would suggest that sending documents 9 that are -- okay. The -- the question -- the follow-up 10 question from what you're saying, Your Honor, would be, 11 well, what -- what -- does it mean just service of 12 initiating documents, service of process, or service of 13 any judicial documents? 14 Now, if you -- the -- the first part of the 15 treaty talks about service of -- of judicial documents. 16 And so it would seem to me logical to include within a 17 treaty that's focusing on service of documents 18 internationally, also service of documents after service 19 of process. And so from my perspective -- and I think 20 I'm a fairly reasonable man -- so from the reasonable 21 person's perspective, you would think that it -- that 22 you would include service of other types of documents 23 within a service of process treaty. 24 And now also there's a really important 25 extrajudicial -- and I'm -- I'm going to jump into
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 some extra text --

22

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm not grasping

3 what you mean by "process." It's on the -- the

4 convention is on the service of documents.

5 MR. HOOTMAN: Yes. Judicial documents.

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And so is the

7 notion of process the way we think about it in the

8 United States, a process server? That's not universal,

9 is it? I mean, a lot of civil law countries don't have

10 the notion of tagging -- having a process server tag the

11 defendant.

12 MR. HOOTMAN: Right. Okay. The -- the

13 history -- okay. I do want to jump into some extra

14 textual information which specifically addresses that

15 and a lot of other things.

16 Okay. So the history of this -- of this

17 treaty was -- was such that they weren't -- they were

18 really trying to kill this French method of service

19 in -- in France, "nova de cashiano" -- I don't speak

20 French, so -- but the Schlunk case talks all about it.

21 And -- and the problem there was that an official in

22 France, once you give the citation, the -- the

23 certificate or citation or summons, to the official

24 there, that is service. And so -- so defaults were

25 being entered against parties that never actually got

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 notice.

23

2 And so then -- then the United States had --

3 had passed a -- had passed Public Law 88-619 in 1964,

4 whereby we allowed foreign countries to come here and to

5 easily effectuate foreign service by going to a district

6 judge and getting an order signed to serve, say, a

7 French or Ugandan or wherever, a -- a summons on -- on

8 an American -- or whatever person is in the

9 United States. So they could get judicial assistance

10 from the United States very easily.

11 Okay. So within the context of that act,

12 then the United States went -- sent their

13 representatives to The Hague to start getting engaged

14 with this -- this Hague Conference to normalize

15 international laws. And -- and so the motive was to get

16 the other countries to make it easy for our citizens to

17 serve overseas and also to -- to push forward due

18 process, okay.

19 And so then the -- when the drafters,

20 they -- they got this -- this convention prepared, then

21 they came to the -- the Senate committee, and then the

22 lead spokesman at that Senate committee was asked

23 specifically -- and I have the page here -- I don't have

24 it handy, but basically the -- the spokesperson for

25 that -- for America told the Senate -- the senators --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 that the only thing America is giving up is the same

24

2 thing that we had already given in that Federal act that

3 I just mentioned. And that Federal act doesn't have

4 anything in it about -- about mail.

5 So -- so the actual lawmakers of the

6 United States that signed off on this treaty were told

7 by the people that participated in the -- in the

8 convention drafting that -- that we're going to -- it

9 wasn't all about service, like you were saying, Your

10 Honor. It was either -- it was, in large part, about

11 due process. And the only thing that we're giving up is

12 the same thing that we gave up in -- in this Federal act

13 that I'm talking about.

14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm sorry. Did we

15 give up or do you think they thought we were giving up

16 the right to authorize States to permit service by mail?

17 MR. HOOTMAN: Service by mail was --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or your position is --

19 is that we did; that in the treaty, we intended, by

20 signing the treaty, to give up the power of States to

21 authorize the service by mail?

22 MR. HOOTMAN: Service by mail was actually

23 not talked about in the Senate hearings. There was

24 one --

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm asking you, do you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
25 1 think it's a fair reading of a treaty for us to read it 2 to constrict the rights of States to effect service 3 consistent with due process? Because there's no doubt 4 that we consider mail service consistent with due 5 process. 6 MR. HOOTMAN: Okay -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The United States 8 authorize it, right? 9 MR. HOOTMAN: Well, the -- under -10 according to Brockmeyer, the case -- the -- the position 11 that the Solicitor General wants the Court to adopt, the 12 actual holding in that case was that the Article 10(a) 13 does -- does not authorize service by mail. It permits 14 it -15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 16 MR. HOOTMAN: -- meaning, you've got to look 17 at the local law -18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I accept that. But 19 many states permit service by mail, correct? 20 MR. HOOTMAN: Well, Texas doesn't, according 21 to the majority opinion in this case, because all four 22 of my points were sustained in the -- in the lower 23 court. And one of those points was specifically whether 24 or not Texas authorizes service by mail. 25 So if you were to --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
26 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- take Rule -- Rule 2 4(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It 3 authorizes service, as in the courts of the State where 4 the district court is located. And I think Justice 5 Sotomayor is referring to some States -- not Texas -6 but some States do authorize service of the summons and 7 complaint by mail. 8 MR. HOOTMAN: I'm sure some States somewhere 9 do. They -- they could theoretically, let's put it that 10 way. And so then you -- then you -- then you're with -11 up to the question of -- okay, let me -- let me put this 12 way. 13 In Brockmeyer, the Court said that the 14 treaty does not authorize it, but Rule 4(f) of the 15 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows it in some 16 circumstances; namely, when the clerk sends it. So the 17 clerk can mail the -- the process, but the party can't 18 and, therefore, I win in my case. 19 Now, in this -- in my case, the Texas -- the 20 Texas Court of Appeals, the majority opinion actually 21 sustained all four of my issues that were raised in 22 the -- in the court of appeals. And one of those was -23 and by the way, the -- the dissent said I waived that 24 one issue, but -- but the majority of that panel 25 sustained it, which -- and that issue was whether or not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Texas law authorizes service by mail.

27

2 So if the Brockmeyer logic were to be

3 adopted by this Court, you would basically say, well,

4 yes, the -- the treaty permits it, permits it being

5 service by mail, if the local law allows it. And so,

6 yes, it's permitted, but the Texas court has already

7 ruled on it and, therefore, a decision -- the lower

8 court's ruling is affirmed.

9 So -- so even if you go this -- this route

10 of it's not authorized, but it's permitted, you still

11 have to affirm the -- the Texas judgment because the

12 majority said that --

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it's -- if it's

14 permitted under a Federal treaty, then how can Texas not

15 permit it?

16 MR. HOOTMAN: Because unless -- that took me

17 a long time to figure that distinction out. But

18 basically, the question is -- and the question of the

19 service was granted on is whether or not the treaty

20 authorizes service by mail. That means the treaty

21 itself says you can serve pursuant to the treaty by

22 sending it in the mail versus the Brockmeyer

23 distinction, which is that the treaty doesn't say that

24 you serve by mail pursuant to the treaty, rather, that

25 the treaty allows the other States or the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 government to pass a rule so that the local law, the

28

2 local United States law allows service by mail. Okay.

3 So then Brockmeyer says work through that and said,

4 well, yes, Rule -- Rule 4(f) permits it, but only if the

5 clerk sends it. And since the clerk in that case didn't

6 send it, the default was set aside.

7 And so -- then then you take that line of

8 thinking and apply it to my case and you say, okay,

9 well, no, the treaty doesn't authorize it, because we

10 follow the Brockmeyer line of thinking, but it does

11 permit it if Texas law allows it. Well, a Texas court

12 already passed on it and said -- in the majority

13 opinion, because they sustained my four issues, Texas

14 law does not authorize service by mail.

15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I thought --

16 I thought I had read this and I'm looking at it. The

17 blue brief at page 9 says, "Under Texas law, a plaintiff

18 can serve a foreign defendant in several ways, including

19 by certified mail return receipt requested, either by

20 sending it to any defendant directly, or if certain

21 conditions are met, by sending it to the Secretary of

22 State, by complying with the provisions of any

23 applicable treaty, and if certain other conditions are

24 met by other court-ordered means."

25 So -- and there's a citation to the two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
29 1 sections of the Texas Civil Procedure Act. So it seems 2 to me that Texas law, on its face, authorizes service by 3 certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any 4 other court-ordered means. So why was the service here 5 ineffective under Texas law? 6 MR. HOOTMAN: Right. It's rule -- Texas 7 Rule of Civil Procedure 108(a). It's entitled service 8 of process in foreign countries. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. 10 MR. HOOTMAN: Right. And it -- and it 11 provided -- it has all this stuff that can happen. 12 Basically, there's about -- there's six different ways 13 that it can occur. 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why wasn't the 15 service here pursuant to one of those authorized Texas 16 ways? 17 MR. HOOTMAN: Well, the short answer is 18 because the Texas court said it wasn't the proper way to 19 do it. Now, I think the more sophisticated response to 20 that would be similar to the Brockmeyer holding, 21 which -- which is because it was sent by -- I walked 22 down -- I walked down to the post office and dropped a 23 summons in the mail and send it to Uganda or wherever to 24 serve somebody, the Texas court said you can't do that. 25 Now, in the Brockmeyer case, the specific
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 reason was is because the clerk didn't do that. Now, if 2 the clerk -- I -- I send a request to the -- to the 3 clerk and I say, hey, please send this -- this summons 4 to Uganda and they drop it in the mail, that would be 5 appropriate under -- under the Ninth Circuit case. 6 Okay? But the -- but the point here is that -- that if 7 you follow the Brockmeyer line of thinking, you have 8 to -- to -- service by mail is proper, if our local 9 authority allows it. And in our case, the majority 10 opinion sustained all four points, and one of those 11 points was that Texas law doesn't allow it. 12 And -- and also, you know, the technical -13 I don't mean to be overly technical, but we didn't -14 you didn't grant cert on the question of whether or not 15 the Texas law allows it. We -- we granted on whether or 16 not the treaty authorizes it. 17 And so I've got that holding from the Texas 18 court on the Texas law. I think that's dispositive, 19 assuming you get to that. And the only way you get to 20 that is if you say that the treaty -- if you say that 21 the treaty authorizes service by mail, you don't even 22 get into that can of worms, because the treaty itself is 23 the vehicle through which you're serving process. 24 Okay? 25 If you follow the Brockmeyer line of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 thinking, you say, well, no, the treaty doesn't

31

2 authorize it, but it permits it, then you run into the

3 Texas majority holding which has already ruled on that

4 question. And --

5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think it's a problem

6 for your position that no other court in the world has

7 construed the treaty this way?

8 MR. HOOTMAN: That's clearly a problem.

9 That's why I focused so hard on text.

10 (Laughter.)

11 MR. HOOTMAN: I mean -- I mean --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Someone's got to be

13 first, right?

14 (Laughter.)

15 MR. HOOTMAN: Then that now -- that is why I

16 cited to -- I forgot what they call it, but it's

17 basically the -- the restatement of law in Europe.

18 That's why I cited to that, to see what their mindset

19 is. And I don't know if you recall that quote in my

20 brief, but basically, they will look at a document when

21 they're interpreting it, if it says X, but -- but

22 everyone's intent was Y, they go with Y. And that's --

23 that just runs train -- a steam train roller over our

24 separation of powers concept.

25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, this goes back to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 Justice Alito's question. I mean, is that -- is that 2 your answer to it, that it's just they're all construing 3 this because he -- they use a completely different 4 interpretive stance than we do? 5 MR. HOOTMAN: No doubt about it. It's a 6 whole different mindset. They -- they're looking at the 7 subjectivity of what everybody wanted. And here, 8 because of our separation of powers, who's the law 9 maker, that's why I go off in the area and all that 10 other really interesting stuff, and I think it's 11 actually crucial here because -12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, one question I suppose 13 might be whether that is in fact producing the disparity 14 in -- in judgments. But even suppose you're right that 15 it is, I mean, these are treaties. So the idea that, 16 you know, we would be consistently interpreting a treaty 17 differently from the entire rest of the world would seem 18 to create problems for our treaty-making powers, for 19 our -- our ability to conform with what our treaty 20 partners expect. I mean, it would be -- be sort of a 21 problem for international relations, wouldn't it? If 22 we're like, well, we just interpret everything that we 23 write differently from the way everybody else in the 24 world does. 25 MR. HOOTMAN: Clearly, we've got to be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 respectful to our foreign friends. Clearly, we don't 2 want to be -- come across as, you know, arrogant four 3 sort of thinking. 4 Okay. We do have also to respect the 5 Constitution. Who -- who passes these laws? The 6 lawmakers. 7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are taking a 8 statement from a -- it's not exactly restatement; it's 9 sort of this European project written by a law professor 10 in Denmark. And you're saying that's how 11 all Europeans -- they don't -- you don't think that they 12 have the same debates that we have on the extent to 13 which you go beyond the text? You think they all agree 14 about the way you interpret text and it's all that -15 what Orlando said is -- that's true, generally? I think 16 you find it -- they have the same debates that we do. 17 MR. HOOTMAN: I'm definitely no European 18 legal scholar, by any means, but I do -- I do believe 19 that -- that cite that I gave, I did some research to 20 see how respected it was, and I believe -- maybe I'm 21 wrong on that, but I think it's on par with our 22 restatement. 23 Do they -- do they do what we do here? 24 Well, if you look at the Vienna Convention -25 And someone brought that up, by the way.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 The Vienna Convention says how you're supposed to

34

2 interpret treaties. They actually do the opposite of

3 that, that quote that -- that you're -- that I gave you

4 and now you're giving back to me. And they focus hard

5 on text, just like I'm urging the Court to do under our

6 separation of powers doctrine.

7 So I surmise that -- that a fair amount of

8 them do look at that -- that section, but then a whole

9 lot of 'em others also surely look at the Vienna

10 Convention, because they're the ones that most of the

11 European countries, if not all of them, have actually

12 signed off on it. And the United States has not.

13 But it is -- it is a codification of

14 customary international law. And, therefore, you know,

15 if -- depending on how much emphasis we put on customary

16 international law, we're going to look at the Vienna

17 Convention to help us interpret a treaty, assuming you

18 get beyond the text like I've urged the Court in the

19 first half of my brief.

20 So in answer to your question --

21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the source that

22 you cite is not talking about the interpretation of

23 statutes; it's talking about the interpretation of

24 private contracts between two individuals.

25 MR. HOOTMAN: That's primarily the -- yes, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
35 1 would agree with that. And I -- and I didn't mean to 2 cite to that as, oh, look here, here's my number one 3 cite at all. I was just trying to give a perspective 4 on, hey, look, I do have all these international cases 5 against me, but let's look at their mindset a little 6 bit. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the -8 I mean, if you are talking about -- and I think this is 9 a distinction between statutes and treaties. We 10 visualize treaties, anyway, as close to -- to contracts. 11 And if you're talking about contracts, it's very 12 important to -- what the conduct and expectations of the 13 parties were as they went into the contract, and it's 14 significant evidence of sort of how they dealt with the 15 situations after the contract, somewhat unlike how you 16 might interpret a statute. 17 MR. HOOTMAN: I have a real problem -- and I 18 realize the cases make this analogy to contracts -- but 19 I have a real problem with that analogy, because it -20 it doesn't factor in the -- the Constitution. We -- we 21 adopt a treaty and make it a Federal law, just like a 22 Federal statute, except it's done through the President 23 and et cetera. 24 And so it's really not -- yes, it's like a 25 contract, but, no, it's not. Because this Court has to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
36 1 apply the Constitution to it. And so here, you -- if -2 you have the drafters and then the nice Bartleby's 3 error, the scrivener's error -- and by the way, this 4 Court has written on when there's a scrivener's error, 5 we're not going to just fix it, because that's 6 legislating. Unless -- unless the error has -- has, you 7 know, a ridiculous -- the absurdity doctrine and it's 8 got a -- so under -- under you-all's kind of authority, 9 you can't just fix the scrivener's error. 10 And so the scholar, Mr. Ristau, I thought, 11 did me a great favor by, yes, he went page after page 12 that I lose, I lose, it's okay. But then he says it's a 13 scrivener's error. So then when you apply the 14 separation of powers doctrine principles to that, you 15 can't just fix it because there's a logical reason to 16 include service of -- service of process-type documents. 17 Because it makes perfect -- to me, it makes perfectly 18 good sense. It make -- it doesn't -- it doesn't make 19 sense to me to not include that in there. 20 And so if you use the -- the canon of -- you 21 call it canon or a method of usage, and -- and different 22 word -- there's a different meaning, if you can see the 23 different meaning, you don't -- you don't have an 24 ambiguous situation here. And so you are bound by the 25 Constitution to interpret the words of the -- of the --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 of the treaty and say: Well, it's not authorized.

37

2 So that's kind of how I analyze it.

3 And then -- and then I really want -- this,

4 to me, is a really big point, and I haven't articulated

5 it well, but the Solicitor General cited to the Senate

6 Record where the -- the international guys that went

7 over to the Hague and brought this beautiful treaty that

8 they put a whole lot of work into with the history of

9 this -- this Federal statute that I'm talking about,

10 everyone wanted to start cooperating.

11 Then they get before the Senate testifying,

12 and one of the senators is asking something like, well,

13 what do we get out of this? And -- and -- and he's got

14 this section in there, it's -- it's on -- it's on

15 page 24 and 25, he's the U.S. delegate, Philip Amram,

16 and -- and he said due process and also we are giving

17 nothing we had not already given in -- in Public Law

18 88619.

19 So the senators that actually signed off on

20 this, that's what they heard. And you got to understand

21 that that -- it's so important, I put it in my little

22 book here. Okay. That Public Law 88619 was a big deal

23 back then, because America says: Hey, we're going to

24 let the foreigners come over here, go to a district

25 judge, request an order to serve, you know, a French

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 petition or whatever.

38

2 And then after that -- and that was a -- you

3 know, that was politically a big deal. We open our

4 doors and we want them to open their doors to us.

5 So they go -- they go -- they go prepare

6 this treaty, and then they come back and testify to

7 the -- to the people that are going to actually make our

8 law and they tell them that's -- that's what -- what

9 happened. And now we got this mail thing going on.

10 So -- so from the lawmakers' perspective,

11 they didn't actually hear that.

12 Now, there is a bar review article that the

13 same man that testified, Mr. Amram, there's a little

14 section in there, which the Solicitor General cites in

15 their brief, where they say something like service by

16 mail. He -- and I read the article. It goes on and on

17 about this treaty, a little bit mind-numbing. But

18 it's -- and then he says Article 10(a) service by mail,

19 it's a little bitty snippet. You can see it in the

20 Senate record. But it doesn't -- it doesn't -- service

21 by mail says the same thing that the treaty says. It

22 doesn't say service of process by mail.

23 And so, to me, it would seem like you don't

24 have an ambiguity here. There was a change in usage

25 that makes perfectly good sense to allow service of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 post -- service of process documents, and you can't fix 2 the Bartleby, the scrivener error because of you-all's 3 previous cases, Chan v. Korea, in particular. 4 And -- and then you have the other issue, 5 which is even if you go with this Brockmeyer scenario, 6 then -- then Texas has already passed on this question, 7 and Texas law doesn't allow service by the participant 8 by mail. And so you got to affirm anyway. 9 So if there's no further questions, I'll 10 turn it over to the other -- other side. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 MR. HOOTMAN: Thank you. 13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gaston, you have 14 seven minutes. 15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY GASTON 16 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 17 MR. GASTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Gaston, would you 19 start with the Brockmeyer question? Do you agree with 20 the government on the issue that the treaty only 21 permits, doesn't necessarily authorize? And then your 22 adversary's position that the Texas court has already 23 said that under Texas law, you can't serve this way. 24 MR. GASTON: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 25 We -- Petitioner agrees with the United
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 States' position and it points out, actually, an

40

2 ambiguity in the world "authorize," which is the

3 question presented that -- that -- that ambiguity is my

4 responsibility, because "authorized" can mean empower or

5 it can mean permit. And in this situation, permit is

6 what the Brockmeyer case reads it as, it's what the

7 United States suggests is correct, and we -- we think

8 that is correct because of the ambiguity in the statute

9 of what the freedom to do things means.

10 And -- and I would also alert the Court to

11 some more specific discussion of that. The Permanent

12 Bureau of the Hague Conference puts out a handbook every

13 so many years, and the 2016 edition, which is the fourth

14 edition, at paragraph 257, discusses some extrinsic

15 evidence from the 1964 Special Commission discussions

16 during the drafting, making it clear that it was a

17 two-part test. If the State doesn't object, State of

18 destination, you have to look at the law of the forum

19 and see if it affirmatively authorizes it.

20 Moving then to the -- to the contention that

21 the court of appeals here has already ruled that service

22 by mail wasn't allowed under Texas law, that's -- that's

23 the result of the holding because the Court held that

24 the treaty preempts Texas law. And it -- and it -- and

25 if the treaty, in fact, prohibits service of process by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 mail, it does preempt Texas law. And that's what the -2 this Court in Schlunk said. It said that the treaty 3 is -- is mandatory and it preempts inconsistent methods 4 of service under -- under State or Federal law. But 5 that was not a determination that, apart from the 6 treaty, service of process here was not consistent with 7 Texas law and -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that preemption 9 question before us? 10 MR. GASTON: No. I would say it has been -11 it has been decided by this Court in -- in Schlunk, and 12 the Court -- and it cited a prior case -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we're not 14 being asked to rule on that because I gather the Texas 15 Court of Appeals has a different view on that. 16 MR. GASTON: I think the Texas Court of 17 Appeals has the same view, which is that -- that if the 18 treaty prohibits service by mail, the fact that it's 19 authorized under Texas law is dead letter and 20 therefore -21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we were told by the 22 other side that Texas law -- forget about treaties -23 Texas law does not permit service of process by mail 24 period. 25 MR. GASTON: And that is nowhere in the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 court of appeals decision. And the Texas State law

42

2 determinations that we -- this Texas State law that we

3 cite at pages 9 and 10 of -- of the blue brief provide

4 three or four ways in which service of process by mail

5 on --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: If you win in -- this

7 Article 10, in fact, permits service by mail, then

8 you'll go back to Texas and you'll say, see, it permits

9 it expressly. So the rest of the treaty doesn't preempt

10 the provision that allows service by mail, so Texas law

11 no longer prohibits it; is that right?

12 MR. GASTON: Yes.

13 JUSTICE BREYER: So we should send it back.

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't say that

15 at all. What Article 10 says is whether or not the

16 convention shall interfere with a particular way. So

17 then you simply say if you're right, okay, the

18 convention doesn't interfere with it, but Texas law can

19 prohibit it.

20 MR. GASTON: Yes.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely say it doesn't.

22 MR. GASTON: Yes, that is absolutely

23 our position.

24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the Court of

25 Appeals said otherwise?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
43 1 MR. GASTON: No, the court of appeals held 2 that The Hague Service Convention prohibits service of 3 process by mail and, therefore, it sustained the 4 Respondent's challenge to the trial court judgment on 5 the basis that there was no valid service of process 6 because the service that was effected was prohibited by 7 The Hague Service Convention. The -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, I'm sorry, you're saying 9 it just never got to this question of what Texas law 10 says. 11 MR. GASTON: Correct. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. 13 MR. GASTON: On our blue brief at 32 and 33, 14 I think it's clear, not only did the negotiator for the 15 United States tell the Senate that this treaty involved 16 service -- allowed service by mail and the Executive 17 Branch internally relayed that message to the -- to the 18 President, so it's very clear internally that the 19 United States Executive Branch understood that the 20 United States' intent was that it allowed service by 21 mail. Respondent makes a distinction between service of 22 process and service of post-answer documents. 23 I think while one might imagine a treaty 24 that would do that, this treaty doesn't make any 25 internal distinctions between judicial documents that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 are process and other judicial documents with the

44

2 limited exception of Article 15 that only talks about

3 getting relief from a default judgment with respect to a

4 summons not -- not being served. And so as one lower

5 court has said, it would be very odd if Article 10(a)

6 was about service of every judicial document except

7 process, which is what would be required to -- to go

8 with Respondent's interpretation.

9 And unless the Court has any further

10 questions, I would cede the rest of my time.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

12 The case is submitted.
