3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:04 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 4 argument next in Case 16-348, Midland Funding v. 5 Johnson. 6 Mr. Shanmugam. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, 10 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 11 The Bankruptcy Code sets up a process for 12 evaluating claims that are subject to potential 13 limitations defenses. Under that process, a creditor 14 seeking to collect on a debt files a proof of claim. 15 For certain types of consumer debt, the creditor also 16 includes information to enable the trustee and other 17 parties in interest to assess the claim's timeliness and 18 where appropriate to object. A creditor is not required 19 to go further and to certify that there is no valid 20 limitations defense to its own claim. If that is 21 exactly what Respondent and the government are asking 22 this Court to do, under the guise of interpreting the 23 Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. There is nothing -24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the Fair Debt 25 Collection Practices Act, suppose there were a suit
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 brought in court to collect on a debt that is

4

2 time-barred. Would that violate the Fair Credit law if

3 you sued in court on a debt that was time-barred?

4 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, our view,

5 perhaps not surprisingly, is no. Our view is that there

6 would be nothing misleading or unfair about the suit in

7 that instance.

8 But this Court need not address that issue

9 in order to resolve the question presented here, and

10 indeed, the courts of appeals that have accepted our

11 view have largely assumed that the filing of a suit in

12 state court presents different considerations from the

13 filing of a proof of claim in bankruptcy. And that is

14 for the simple reason that there are distinctive

15 characteristics about the operation of the bankruptcy

16 system.

17 First, and perhaps most importantly, the

18 bankruptcy system defines the term "claim" quite broadly

19 to include any circumstance in which there is a right to

20 payment. And as this Court held in Butner, whether or

21 not there is a right to payment is defined under state

22 law, and Alabama law is clear that the running of a

23 limitations period does not extinguish the right; the

24 right remains. And so, for instance, if the debtor

25 takes some action to make repayment, the right springs

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 back into life, indeed, the right never disappears in

5

2 the first place, but the right, once again, becomes

3 judicially enforceable.

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there -- are there any

5 circumstances, just as a practical matter, where the

6 trustee decides that the trustee is going to pay the

7 time-barred debt, it's obviously prejudicial to the

8 other creditors. Are there any -- I was -- I was just

9 trying to think of that. I -- I can't think of any

10 instance in which a trustee would want to do that. I

11 was thinking suppose the debtor wanted to continue a

12 business relation with the -- with -- with the creditor

13 whose debt is time-barred, and -- and as for -- but I --

14 I just can't think of any instance. But perhaps --

15 MR. SHANMUGAM: No, and -- and -- and

16 Justice Kennedy, I can't think of any instance either,

17 and I think that that's precisely because the trustee

18 has the statutory duty to object, to preserve the assets

19 of the estate, and to do so for the creditors. And,

20 again, that is a critical feature of the bankruptcy

21 system.

22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm having a

23 great deal of difficulty with this business model.

24 Completely. You buy old, old debts that you know for

25 certainty are not within any statute of limitations.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 You buy them and you call up creditors and you say to

6

2 them, you don't have to pay me. But out of the goodness

3 of your heart, you should? Or do you just call them up

4 and say, you owe me money, and you hope that they'll pay

5 you.

6 And is it the same thing in bankruptcy

7 court? You filed a claim and you hope the trustee

8 doesn't see that it's out of time? And apparently, you

9 collect on millions of dollars of these debts. So is

10 that what you do?

11 MR. SHANMUGAM: So, Justice Sotomayor, I do

12 not think that that is a valid understanding of our

13 business model, and let me explain why.

14 First, this debt was not time-barred at the

15 time it was purchased. And indeed, Midland, my client,

16 makes every effort not to purchase time-barred debt.

17 Now, of course, they're not always correct in their

18 assessments, and debt that is not time-barred at the

19 time of purchase can come --

20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you have a

21 good-faith basis in this case to believe that the debt

22 was not time-barred --

23 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well --

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when you filed this

25 claim? Forget about some of the others.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Just to be clear, there is 2 actually no allegation in this case that we knew that 3 there was a valid limitations defense. If you take a 4 look at the complaint in this case, and if you take a 5 look at page 25 of the Joint Appendix in particular, all 6 that the complaint alleges is that we were aware of the 7 very facts that we disclosed in the proof of claim. 8 Facts that, to be sure, indicated the existence of a 9 potential limitations defense. Because, after all -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you have a 11 good-faith basis to believe the statute of limitations 12 was not applicable? 13 MR. SHANMUGAM: Midland at the time would 14 file proofs of claim without conducting some sort of 15 exhaustive inquiry, and that's for the simple reason 16 that Midland did not believe that that was legally 17 required. And so, again, there is no record on this 18 issue -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with 20 the committee notes that say that everyone who files a 21 proof of claim has an obligation to do a good-faith 22 inquiry as to whether it's an enforceable obligation or 23 not? 24 MR. SHANMUGAM: I don't think that that is 25 an accurate characterization of what the advisory
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 committee did. And let me first --

8

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Not what they

3 did; what they said.

4 MR. SHANMUGAM: I don't think that that's an

5 accurate characterization of what they said, either.

6 And let me explain why that's true.

7 First of all, let me set out what the

8 advisory committee actually did, because that's a

9 critical part of our argument. In Rule 3001(c)(3),

10 which was adopted in 2012, the advisory committee

11 required certain disclosures, the whole point of which

12 was to put trustees and other parties in interest on

13 notice of the potential availability of a limitations

14 defense.

15 And the advisory committee thought about

16 going further. It thought about doing, again, exactly

17 what Respondent and the government are asking this Court

18 to do under the FDCPA; namely, to require a

19 certification that having investigated the existence of

20 a limitations defense, the creditor had made a

21 determination that there was no valid such defense.

22 Now, the advisory committee decided not to

23 do that, Justice Sotomayor, and it decided not to do

24 that for two critical reasons. The first was that the

25 advisory committee recognized that the question of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 whether or not there is a valid limitations defense

9

2 as -- as opposed to the question of whether or not the

3 claim appears to be time-barred, could be complicated.

4 And it could be complicated even in the context of

5 consumer debts like these ones, because of the potential

6 for revival and tolling, choice-of-law issues, and the

7 like.

8 The second reason --

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I agree with you. But

10 if -- if that is true that you investigated and you had

11 a good-faith basis for believing that it wasn't

12 time-barred, you wouldn't be liable either under the

13 bankruptcy rules or under these debtor rules. So -- but

14 the point is if you were unaware and didn't properly

15 investigate, have you fulfilled your obligations as a

16 lawyer to the bankruptcy court?

17 MR. SHANMUGAM: And our view, Justice

18 Sotomayor, just to be clear, is that you have done

19 exactly what the code itself contemplates.

20 And this goes to the second reason why the

21 advisory committee did not go further. The advisory

22 committee expressed a concern that if it had gone

23 further, it could be violating the Bankruptcy Rules

24 Enabling Act because it would be acting inconsistently

25 with the burden-shifting framework that the code itself

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 devised.

10

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I don't

3 remember reading that in these. Could you give me a

4 record cite for that?

5 MR. SHANMUGAM: I --

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or you can do it in your

7 reply.

8 MR. SHANMUGAM: No. It's -- it's in our

9 brief --

10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or --

11 MR. SHANMUGAM: It's in our brief at page --

12 I believe it's at page 86 of the Agenda Book where the

13 advisory committee working group discusses the proposal

14 to require creditors to, quote, "State whether the claim

15 is timely under the relevant statute of limitations."

16 But let me explain that point in a little

17 more detail, because I do think that this is really

18 important to understanding our argument here. The way

19 that the Bankruptcy Code operates is first, that a party

20 is entitled -- a creditor is entitled to file a proof of

21 claim where they have a right to payment. And at that

22 point, the burden shifts. The claim is presumptively

23 valid. And if there is an issue concerning the

24 enforceability of the claim, that is an issue that has

25 to be raised by the trustee or by another party in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 interest or else the claim will be allowed.

11

2 Now, what I think Respondent and the

3 government are trying to do here is to really align two

4 separate concepts: The question of validity on the one

5 hand and the question of enforceability on the other.

6 And I think Respondent, in particular, is attempting to

7 somehow build the concept of enforceability into the

8 definition of a claim.

9 But how we know that that is not true is by

10 virtue of the fact that in Section 502(b), the

11 statute -- the code specifically provides that

12 enforceability is a basis for objecting and for

13 disallowing a claim. It doesn't go to the question of

14 whether or not you have a valid claim in the first

15 place.

16 So, once again, all of this really depends

17 critically --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm -- I'm a

19 little bit confused. The fact that the code anticipates

20 that some people will file unenforceable claims even

21 though they shouldn't, that that somehow proves that the

22 code invites unenforceable claims?

23 MR. SHANMUGAM: Quite to the contrary,

24 Justice Sotomayor. The code specifically wants this to

25 happen because the code defines claims expansively. And

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 that is because in 1978, when Congress adopted the

12

2 Bankruptcy Code, it adopted this broad definition of

3 claim to bring claims into the bankruptcy estate. So

4 there is --

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Contingent, unmatured,

6 these are all words that suggest an entitlement to

7 payment. Where in the definition any use of word -- of

8 words talk about a claim that's unenforceable? A

9 contingent claim may not be enforceable today, but it

10 might be in the future.

11 MR. SHANMUGAM: I agree with the first half

12 of your question, but not the second, Justice Sotomayor,

13 because you're right: The code talks about an

14 entitlement to payment. But that is precisely what we

15 have here. And to the extent that the code includes as

16 examples of types of rights to payment, contingent

17 claims or unmatured claims, that illustrates that the

18 definition of claim includes rights to payment that may

19 not be presently enforceable.

20 Again, the question of enforceability is a

21 question that arises with regard to objections. It does

22 not relate to the question of an entitlement to file a

23 claim. And this is critical to understanding how the

24 Bankruptcy Code works.

25 Now, how the Bankruptcy Code works in turn

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
13 1 informs the application of the actual language of the 2 FDCPA, which is, after all, the question before this 3 Court. 4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Before you get to that 5 language, Mr. Shanmugam. Could you just -- you know, 6 just from a commonsense basis, it seems hard to 7 understand why Congress would want all these 8 unenforceable proofs of claim to flow in, because only 9 two things can happen. One is that the trustee will 10 properly filter out those claims; and the other is that 11 the trustee will be swamped and won't have the time or 12 the energy or the inclination or he'll make mistakes, 13 and some of those claims will be deemed enforceable 14 when, in fact, they're not. 15 So why would anybody want these proofs of 16 claim to flood into the bankruptcy system? 17 MR. SHANMUGAM: So, Justice Kagan, two 18 responses to that. The first is that, again, you know, 19 we don't know that these claims are unenforceable. I 20 think what we know is that there is an apparent time bar 21 to these claims. The very facts that are disclosed in 22 the proof of claim illustrate that. And there is some 23 further work to be done before an ultimate legal 24 determination can be made about whether there is a valid 25 limitations defense.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 And Congress very consciously put that 2 burden on the trustee and other parties in interest in 3 the Bankruptcy Code. The trustee or the debtor or any 4 other party in interest can come in and object and the 5 issue can be litigated. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I -- but I -- the 7 understanding here is that this case involves not claims 8 which maybe they're barred by the statute of limitations 9 and maybe they're not, but the issue, as presented to 10 us, is as to claims where everybody knows, including the 11 person who's filing the proof of claim, that they're 12 barred by the statute of limitations. 13 And what sense could it make for Congress to 14 think, oh, that's a great idea for some -- for people 15 just to file those claims and -- and, you know, the -16 on the -- on -- the best thing that can happen is that 17 those claims will be filtered out, and the worst thing 18 that can happen is that they won't be. People will make 19 mistakes and people will pay on things that they 20 shouldn't be paying on. 21 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yeah. And Justice Kagan, 22 just to be clear, I'm disputing the assumption that we 23 somehow acted with knowledge here. But I'm happy for 24 this Court to consider this case, as we said in footnote 25 1 of our brief, on the assumption that if there had been
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 an objection, the claim would have been disallowed.

15

2 I think that the answer, though, is still

3 the same. And I think that Congress, in adopting this

4 system in the Code, must have known that some number of

5 claims would be allowed that should otherwise be

6 disallowed if there is an objection. Because after all,

7 that is the unelectable consequence of imposing the

8 burden on responsive parties in deeming claims to be

9 valid, absent and objection.

10 But the reason -- the affirmative reason why

11 Congress would have wanted to do that is precisely

12 because of the fresh start principle that underlies the

13 entire bankruptcy system.

14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of that -- help

15 me, it's on basic bankruptcy law. Suppose I'm a debtor.

16 I know that the claim is time barred. Do I list that

17 claim with the trustee just to be sure that it can be a

18 part of the discharge that the claim is -- that -- that

19 the claim is extinguished and I can't later be sued?

20 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think it should be listed

21 for the simple reason that there is a valid claim and

22 there is, therefore, a valid right to payment.

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As a routine matter,

24 does -- does the discharge extinguish that claim?

25 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that is correct. And

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 the virtue --

16

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would need -- if

3 a claim is time barred, you don't need a fresh start to

4 get rid of that claim. You say it's time barred,

5 therefore, no claim. You don't need a discharge in

6 bankruptcy to accomplish that.

7 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, I disagree

8 with that solely because of the virtue of a discharge.

9 And the virtue of a discharge is that in the language of

10 the Code and the language in particular of Section

11 523(a)(3), the discharge prevents the creditor from

12 taking any act to collect. And that includes efforts to

13 encourage the debtor, notwithstanding the absence of a

14 judicial remedy, to make any sort of payment, which I

15 think Respondent acknowledges that a debtor retains --

16 we have some ability to do even after --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would also foreclose

18 the possibility of the creditor arguing that there had

19 been a waiver.

20 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. I guess --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, if the

22 debt is discharged, then the debtor doesn't have to

23 worry about some claim that he had waived the statute of

24 limitations.

25 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. Well, that is correct

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 in the sense that, again, the creditor can take no

17

2 action to collect even a sort of voluntary request for

3 payment. And that has very real value. And in

4 addition, as we explained in our brief, discharge has

5 other collateral consequences in prohibiting certain

6 types of discrimination based on the existence of debts.

7 And those are the very principles that again underlie,

8 not just the Code more generally, but the very broad

9 definition of claim in particular. And that really was

10 an innovation of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, namely,

11 replacing the old provability system with a very broad

12 definition of claim that was meant to bring claims

13 within the bankruptcy process.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We are talking about the

15 effect of the FDCPA. And isn't it so that there would

16 be no point in making a claim for a debt that's clearly

17 time barred. No point in doing that except for the

18 chance that it will be overlooked, that it will be

19 skipped. And that you will get paid on the assumption

20 that it's a good claim when, in fact, it isn't.

21 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, I think that

22 that question, Justice Ginsburg, presupposes a state of

23 mind, which is simply not alleged and on which there is

24 simply no record in this case or in other cases. But I

25 don't want to fight that factual premise too hard

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 because I think that even if such a state of mind

18

2 exists, the operation of the Code is the same. Again,

3 the state of mind of the creditor is neither here nor

4 there for purposes of the operation of the Code. The

5 sole question for purposes of the operation of the Code

6 is whether or not there is a right to payment. And so

7 when these proofs of claim were filed, the -- there --

8 there is not an extensive further investigation at that

9 point, or at least I'm certainly not aware of one on the

10 part of in my client or on the part of debt collectors

11 more generally.

12 What the debt collector is obligated to do

13 under the Code and under the rules is to disclose the

14 information that essentially provides the world notice

15 of a prima facie limitation.

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry.

17 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I was going to bring

18 this back to the language of the Code because I did want

19 to address that, but Justice Kagan.

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let's suppose that you are

21 right, that the Code allows this. I mean, it's hard for

22 me to believe that the Code actively invites it, but

23 let's suppose, as it's written, allows that. So then

24 you wouldn't violate the Code by filing these proofs of

25 claim. That's -- that's for sure. But why would that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 also absolve you from liability under other statutes? 2 The codes does not obligate this. You don't have to do 3 this under the Code. It's a choice. And then another 4 statute can come along and say, you know what, for 5 certain actors, for certain creditors, for these debt 6 collectors, there's an independent rule and the Code 7 says nothing about that. 8 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yeah. So let me address, 9 first, the specific language of the FDCPA. And I want 10 to put down a marker because I want to address the 11 separate issue of how the FDCPA and the Bankruptcy Code 12 relate. 13 We think that the operation of the 14 Bankruptcy Code informs the analysis under the two 15 relevant provisions of the FDCPA. First, on the 16 question of whether or not we made false or misleading 17 representations and second, the question of whether or 18 not this is an unfair or unconscionable practice. 19 On the question of 1692e, our submission is 20 quite straightforward that there is nothing false or 21 misleading about the submission of a proof of claim that 22 is not only entirely accurate, but that affirmatively 23 puts the world on notice as to the existence of a 24 potential limitations defense. 25 And to go to the second prong of this, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 question of whether or not such a proof of claim is

20

2 misleading, our submission is that the filing of a proof

3 of claim implies only a good-faith basis that the

4 creditor has a claim. It doesn't imply anything about

5 the enforceability of the claim more generally or about

6 the availability of a limitations defense more

7 specifically other than providing affirmative notice

8 that such a potential defense exists.

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What do you

10 do with the language of Pennsylvania Public Welfare v.

11 Davenport where we explicitly said that a claim is a

12 right to payment and enforceable obligation? What do

13 you do with that language?

14 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't think that --

15 that that even rises to the level of, in the parlance of

16 the last argument, a drive-by holding. And that's for

17 the simple reason that neither Davenport nor the later

18 cases citing Davenport in any way purported to somehow

19 exclude unenforceable rights from the definition of a

20 claim. In Davenport, everyone agreed that the right in

21 question was enforceable in some respect. And the

22 question was whether the fact that the enforcement

23 mechanism was limited somehow affected whether or not it

24 came within the definition of claim, and the Court said

25 no.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 But, again, if you thought that that rose to 2 the level of even a passing holding, I would return to 3 the language of the Bankruptcy Code and, in particular, 4 the definition of a claim which says nothing about 5 enforceability. To the contrary, Section 502 builds 6 enforceability into the objections that have to be 7 raised. 8 Now, I do want to say a bit about the other 9 provision of the FDCPA, the provision that prohibits 10 unfair or unconscionable practices. And I think that on 11 that provision, we would rely centrally on the 12 protections provided by the bankruptcy system. It bears 13 remembering that a proof of claim, unlike a civil 14 lawsuit, is not filed against the debtor. It is filed 15 against the estate. And as we've been discussing, the 16 trustee bears a statutory obligation to monitor proofs 17 of claim. 18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's a breach of the 19 trustee's duties if he or she lets the claim go through 20 without objecting? 21 MR. SHANMUGAM: If some purpose would be 22 served. And, Justice Sotomayor, to the extent that you 23 have concern -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that was Justice 25 Kennedy's initial question. What would be the purpose
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 of a trustee permitting a stale claim to go forward?

22

2 MR. SHANMUGAM: The trustee should object

3 where, in the language of the statute, some purpose

4 would be served. And I think there are actually

5 contexts in which an objection might be futile because

6 it would have no effect on any of the other creditors or

7 certainly on the amount that the debtor pays. But

8 otherwise, the trustee should object. And I would say

9 that to the extent that you have concern about --

10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where -- where would

11 that situation arise? The amount the creditor pays

12 might be -- the debtor pays might be true, but every

13 other creditor loses if an unenforceable debt is paid.

14 MR. SHANMUGAM: There -- there could be a

15 case in which the unsecured creditors get nothing. And

16 at that point, it doesn't make any difference because

17 none of the unsecured creditors are going to get paid

18 and there are other similar circumstances.

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So those situations

20 don't account for the $800 million you've collected on

21 these old claims.

22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't -- I don't

23 think that there is a record on how much we've collected

24 with regard to this particular type of claim more

25 generally.

23 1 But leaving that aside, I want to make one 2 very important point about the interplay between the 3 Bankruptcy Code and the FDCPA here. I think that 4 Respondent's briefs sort of has this genus-like quality. 5 Because Respondents fight this to some extent on the 6 operation of the Bankruptcy Code. But I think, really, 7 the principal beef that Respondent has here is that the 8 bankruptcy system just isn't works as it should. 9 If you take a look at pages 29 to 30 of 10 Respondent's brief, Respondent really makes the broader 11 point that trustees and other parties in interest aren't 12 simply objecting as often as they should in bankruptcy 13 and that frustrates -14 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I just ask you a 15 practical question? Would there be anything -- suppose 16 a trustee or the attorney for a debtor said, I am going 17 to -- let's say this case is in Alabama. The statute of 18 limitations for the collection of debt in Alabama is six 19 years. I am going to object to every -- any claim for a 20 debt that was incurred more than six years ago. 21 Would -- would that be inconsistent with the duties of 22 the trustee or the attorney? 23 MR. SHANMUGAM: I mean, no, not necessarily, 24 because at that point essentially what -- what would be 25 happening is that the trustee would say there's a prima
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
24 1 facie limitations defense here, we're going to raise an 2 objection, and at that point the issue would be 3 litigated. And if the creditor in that circumstance 4 didn't come back and request a hearing or otherwise 5 litigate the issue, it -- I think it's quite possible, 6 depending on the nature of the objection, that the 7 objection would be sustained and that the claim would be 8 disallowed. 9 Again -10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'll -- I'll ask 11 Mr. Geyser the same question, but it -- I can't 12 understand why a trustee or an attorney wouldn't take 13 that -- wouldn't take that approach -14 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -15 JUSTICE ALITO: -- automatically object to 16 anything that is over the -- the statute of limitations. 17 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- and I think that 18 this illustrates the artificiality of taking the FDCPA 19 and injecting it into the bankruptcy regime. 20 To be sure, the FDCPA applies to debt 21 collectors specifically, but I think in this context, 22 what would either happen is that there will be an 23 objection and the claim will be disallowed -- that's 24 what took place in this case, albeit on somewhat 25 different grounds. And, of course, in that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 circumstance, there is no harm to the actual debtor

25

2 because the claim has, in fact, been disallowed.

3 If, in fact, the claim has been allowed, it

4 seems quite odd to say that you could still bring an

5 FDCPA action, because what you would effectively be

6 doing is collaterally challenging the bankruptcy court's

7 decision to allow the claim in the first place. And as

8 we explained in our brief -- and we make this point not

9 only specifically with regard to the standing of this

10 plaintiff, but really with regard to this whole category

11 of cases -- one of the reasons why this practice is not

12 unfair or unconscionable is that it is very hard to

13 posit a circumstance in which it will actually lead to

14 an injury to the debtor. And it's really for that

15 reason --

16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're

17 taking up trustee time, which gets paid by the debtor

18 ultimately and at administrative cost. You are taking

19 up the time of other creditors, because there has to be,

20 when an objection is raised, notice to all the

21 creditors, a hearing date set, all of these procedural

22 steps that are unnecessary because you have no basis to

23 believe that this debt is enforceable.

24 MR. SHANMUGAM: Speaking of time, I'd like

25 to reserve the balance of mine, but let me answer your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 question, Justice Sotomayor.

26

2 It is simply not true that the amount that

3 the trustee gets paid is somehow dependent on the

4 objections that the trustee raises, and I would revert

5 to the fundamental principle underlying our argument.

6 This is exactly how Congress thought the system should

7 work. And if the system as an administrative matter is

8 not working as Congress intended, the solution is to fix

9 the bankruptcy system and not to extend the FDCPA into

10 the domain of bankruptcy.

11 I'll reserve the balance of my time. Thank

12 you.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER

16 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17 MR. GEYSER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

18 and may it please the Court:

19 Midland is, in fact, using a business model

20 that intentionally floods bankruptcy courts with

21 time-barred debts. And after the first half of the

22 argument, I think two propositions remain undisputed.

23 The first is that under the Bankruptcy Code,

24 these debts are unenforceable and will lose a hundred

25 percent of the time if anyone objects. The second is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
27 1 there is literally no scenario where Midland collects 2 unless the system breaks down and fails. What -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there other 4 defenses to a debt that you would say are covered by 5 your theory other than the statute of limitations? For 6 example, that the -- the debt was incurred to a contract 7 of adhesion or, you know, the -- the normal list of 8 reasons that a debt might be unenforceable. Does your 9 theory apply to all of those? 10 MR. GEYSER: Our theory, I think, is exactly 11 what Justice Sotomayor said earlier in the argument. A 12 debt collector has to have a good faith belief that they 13 have a right to payment under the code and have a valid 14 and enforceable debt. If they have any reasonable basis 15 to think that -- that an affirmative defense might not 16 apply, then they don't violate the FDCPA. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then what that means 18 is that not just in this case, not just with statute of 19 limitations, that -- that there are a whole set of 20 claims that can be brought in bankruptcy where you would 21 say they don't. They don't have a reasonable good faith 22 belief. And, of course, what they say is we do. We do 23 have a good faith belief. Okay? 24 And now who's going to decide that? A 25 bankruptcy judge? No. An ordinary judge in a case
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
28 1 brought in an ordinary court where, in fact, if one side 2 wins, they get a thousand dollars per instance plus 3 attorney's fees, plus costs. Now, I thought the point 4 of the Bankruptcy Code was to have bankruptcy matters 5 decided in a bankruptcy court and not in an ordinary 6 Article III court. So how do you reconcile what you are 7 arguing with the basic point of bankruptcy? 8 MR. GEYSER: Your Honor, I think the point 9 of the Bankruptcy Code is to have legitimate genuine 10 disputes resolved in the Bankruptcy Code. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Really? Really. How 12 interesting. Then what do they argue about? In -13 in -- I mean, are there cases in bankruptcy court where 14 one side says, I have a legitimate dispute and the other 15 side says, no, you don't? Is that unheard of in 16 bankruptcy court? 17 MR. GEYSER: Not -- not at all -18 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that outside its 19 purpose? 20 MR. GEYSER: Not at all. And to be very 21 clear, our theory doesn't cover that situation. If a 22 creditor can articulate -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Only when the creditor 24 comes in and says, I admit I had no good-faith reason 25 for bringing this. That's the only thing your theory
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 covers?

29

2 MR. GEYSER: No. This is the situation it

3 covers, and this is all it covers. If the affirmative

4 defense, a complete defense, is obvious on the face of

5 the claim, and if there is not an articulable reason to

6 think that that complete defense may not apply, this is

7 exactly the same standard that applies, and all five

8 courts of appeals have looked at this. This is not

9 shifting the burden, this is not imposing an affirmative

10 certification requirement of all creditors to

11 investigate claims that have no defect on the face of

12 the -- the claim.

13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, but

14 how do you know that's the case in the statute of

15 limitations with respect to a statute of limitations

16 defense? There are exceptions to the statutes of

17 limitations that -- that -- totally -- you know, the

18 whole list of -- so it's hard to say. I mean, but

19 the -- the argument on the other side is look, we've

20 spelled out -- we -- we have to have spelled out the

21 sort of basis. If you think there's a statute of

22 limitations defense, here are the dates of these things.

23 If it's obvious on the face, which was the standard

24 you've proposed, then it ought to be obvious to the

25 other side as well.

1 MR. GEYSER: Yeah --

30

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know? Do

3 we -- is there some way we know that there wasn't a

4 tolling argument that could be raised in this case?

5 MR. GEYSER: Your Honor, we -- first, we

6 have alleged that Midland did, in fact, know there was

7 no defense of limitations objection. So that -- that

8 is -- that's how this case comes to the Court.

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was a little

10 disputed footnote battle about that --

11 MR. GEYSER: Yes --

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in terms of what

13 the record provided or not.

14 MR. GEYSER: So -- there was, Your Honor.

15 We -- we think that the original complaint should have

16 been clear in this. It's since been amended to

17 expressly allege that Midland acted with knowledge.

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Let's take

19 the case where the dates, since you asked, it's six

20 years that was incurred, however many years beyond that,

21 and you say they -- they should just not raise it, or

22 you say that they should inquire somehow to make sure

23 that there wasn't a basis for tolling the -- the

24 statute? What -- what do they have to do?

25 MR. GEYSER: All -- all they have to do is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 satisfy and discharge the obligation they have to

31

2 satisfy and discharge under Rule 9011. It's a basic --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, tell me what

4 that is.

5 MR. GEYSER: It's -- it is a reasonable

6 belief, after a reasonable inquiry, that they have a --

7 a ground for the complaint, that the evidentiary

8 allegations have some factual support, and that the

9 claim isn't filed for --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's -- it's not

11 enough for them to say there might be, it's -- you know,

12 there -- a tolling issue here. I mean, their argument

13 is that that's exactly how bankruptcy works. Here we

14 have a claim, and if there is an objection to it, it

15 shifts to the other side. It seems to me that you're

16 putting a burden on them to research the claim before

17 asserting it in bankruptcy.

18 MR. GEYSER: Only when the affirmative

19 defense is blindingly obvious on the face of the

20 complaint. And this, by the way, is the exact same rule

21 that applies in Alabama State court.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- let me -- let

23 me ask this. In -- in State courts generally, my

24 understanding is that there is a debt; it is just not

25 enforceable.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 Forget bankruptcy. A civil practitioner 2 represents the creditors. They know the debt is time 3 barred. Is it unethical to sue because -- on -- on the 4 theory that the defense may not be waived? 5 MR. GEYSER: Your Honor -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They may -- may not be 7 raised? 8 MR. GEYSER: What -- what -9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the defense isn't 10 raised as an affirmative defense, as a matter of 11 pleading I assume in some jurisdictions, and it goes to 12 trial and you say, oh, judge, this is time barred, the 13 judge will say, too late, you didn't raise the defense. 14 MR. GEYSER: An affirmative defense can't 15 be -- can be waived, but I think what's important is 16 that all five courts of appeals that have looked at this 17 have said that if you bring the complaint knowing that 18 it's subject to a complete defense, you're imposing 19 unnecessary costs on a defendant to object. 20 JUSTICE BREYER: It may not be. I mean it 21 depends on the circumstance. But that isn't what's 22 bothering me and I -- and I put it in a sort of -- you 23 have a very good argument. I'm not saying you don't. 24 I'm telling you what's worrying me. 25 What's worrying me is that we take a set of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 cases, which now you've -- you've narrowed it to that 2 set which is sanctionable under Rule 9011, which is a 3 bankruptcy rule with sanctions. And you're saying in 4 addition to the sanctions, the person who -- the debtor 5 can go and bring a different case now under the word 6 "unfair" in the debt collection act. 7 And I'm saying what's worrying me, and I'd 8 like to hear what you say specifically, is that here we 9 have two sets of courts; one with the power to sanction; 10 the other the ordinary Article III court, which 11 presumably will automatically give $1,000 per violation, 12 you know, plus attorneys' fees, plus costs. And that 13 seems what the bankruptcy court was trying to avoid. We 14 want bankruptcy matters decided in bankruptcy court. 15 Now, I don't think I have a convincing 16 argument against you. I have a point. And I'd like to 17 hear what you have to say in response. 18 MR. GEYSER: We appreciate that. I think 19 the -- the ultimate response is what Congress intended 20 with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which it 21 specifically designed for remedies for professional debt 22 collectors, realizing that ordinary remedies like Rule 23 9011 sanctions that are calibrated for general creditors 24 aren't always enough. Professional debt collectors are 25 inventive, they impose heightened risks, and you often
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 need a heightened remedy to check their conduct, which I 2 think is exactly what we see here. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if the States 4 were so worried about that, why don't all States do what 5 apparently two States do? They say if the statute of 6 limitation runs, the debt is barred forever. But, 7 apparently, many States don't say that. They say you 8 can still sue. 9 MR. GEYSER: They -- they do, Your Honor, 10 but I think that States have the option -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the trouble I'm 12 having in this case. 13 MR. GEYSER: Well -- well, to be perfectly 14 clear, even States that don't eliminate the debt, 15 there's still not a right to payment, it's not 16 enforceable in any way that's not purely voluntary. And 17 in Alabama -- and this is, I think, critical here -- it 18 actually gives rise not just to a sanctionable act, but 19 to a tort. It's malicious prosecution to file a lawsuit 20 in Alabama subject to the complete defense of a statute 21 of limitations. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is it just the 23 statute of limitations you're talking about, or is it 24 all affirmative defenses? 25 MR. GEYSER: It's clearly at least the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 statute of limitations. I think it's any complete

35

2 defense to the suit.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. And is it just the

4 statute of limitations you're talking about, or is it

5 all affirmative defenses?

6 MR. GEYSER: Any affirmative defense --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I'm sorry. Any

8 affirmative defense. Some of these, you know, are quite

9 complicated.

10 MR. GEYSER: And -- and --

11 JUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, we're now

12 going to have the Article III judge -- maybe not in some

13 cases, but in many cases -- deciding pretty complicated

14 things as matters of bankruptcy law growing out of a

15 bankruptcy case.

16 Now, if that's wrong, why is it wrong?

17 MR. GEYSER: I think it's wrong for -- for

18 two reasons. The first is that what the -- the matter

19 that they'll be citing in the Fair Debt Collection

20 Practices cases will not be inherent in bankruptcy laws,

21 asking, did you allege a time-barred claim? And it's

22 very easy to --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. You missed my

24 whole point. You said it applies to all affirmative

25 defenses.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 MR. GEYSER: Oh, I'm sorry.

36

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Is the only affirmative

3 defense statute of limitations?

4 MR. GEYSER: No. The --

5 JUSTICE BREYER: Then think of the most

6 complicated one you can think of and let's talk about

7 that one.

8 MR. GEYSER: Well, the most complicated one

9 I can think of we can dispose of very quickly, because

10 anytime there's a good-faith basis defense --

11 affirmative defense might not apply, we don't have an

12 FDCPA claim.

13 JUSTICE KAGAN: So what are the other

14 affirmative defenses that your argument might apply to?

15 MR. GEYSER: I think one example could be a

16 release. Let's say that you sign a release to a claim,

17 and then the debt collector the next day in the

18 bankruptcy files a proof of claim on exactly the same

19 debt they just released. In that case, they're imposing

20 an unnecessary cost on everyone in the process. They're

21 trying to collect a debt that they will only collect in

22 two circumstances. They either actually trick everyone

23 in the system who doesn't realize there's a complete

24 defense, or people do realize there's a complete defense

25 and they acquiesce. And --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Are there any affirmative 2 defenses that your argument might apply to that are 3 bankruptcy-related particularly? Or are these all kind 4 of the sort of defenses that are involved in any suit? 5 MR. GEYSER: I think logically, it's any 6 complete defense to the proof of claim. We've been 7 focusing on the complete defenses under applicable law. 8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. I was asking, are 9 any of those defenses only bankruptcy related? Do some 10 of them only arise in a bankruptcy proceeding? 11 MR. GEYSER: I can't think of one off the 12 top of my head, Justice Kagan. What we're looking at 13 are defenses that, again, you file the proof of claim 14 without a good-faith reason to believe it's actually 15 valid and enforceable. That it's -- it effectively is a 16 rule that says creditors can't act in bad faith. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and where -18 where does the -- where do you litigate the issue of 19 good faith? 20 MR. GEYSER: In good faith, you would 21 litigate it in the FDCPA lawsuit. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: So what you're saying is a 23 set of cases that would warrant a sanction under Rule 24 9011, if I said to the bankruptcy judge, who happens to 25 know something about it because he's heard the case, if
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 I were to ask him -- but who's going to bother to ask 2 him? Because I get my attorneys' fees and a thousand 3 dollars and et cetera. If I go into this other court 4 before a judge who doesn't know about it and just 5 issue -- have a litigate on an easy issue, an easy 6 issue, the state of mind of the individual creditor, ah, 7 yes. It's just state of mind. I grant you the easy 8 thing about state of mind is it's only three words, and 9 the difficult thing is, of course, proving what it was. 10 Now -- now do you see what is worrying me? 11 MR. GEYSER: I do, I do, Justice Breyer. I 12 think that in the bankruptcy setting, first of all, 13 given the speed of the proof of claim process, the odds 14 are the objection will be adjudicated before the FDCPA 15 suit is -- is far underway or underway at all, which is 16 actually what happened in this case. 17 I also think that in most circumstances, the 18 state of mind can be satisfied by the creditor by simply 19 articulating any reason they filed the -- the suit. 20 They simply have to explain, why did you -- why did you 21 think you were entitled to collect? Because every claim 22 in the bankruptcy process is automatically deemed prima 23 facie valid and enforceable. And when a debt collector 24 says by filing a proof of claim, I believe I have a 25 right to payment on an enforceable obligation, and they
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 know that's not true, then they are misstating the

39

2 character and the legal status of the debt.

3 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you the question

4 that I -- I asked your -- your adversary. Why -- why do

5 these time-barred claims slip through? I mean, that's a

6 big part of your argument. Why don't trustees and

7 attorneys for the debtor automatically object to any

8 claim that is beyond the number of years set out in the

9 statute of limitations?

10 MR. GEYSER: I think there are two reasons

11 that they don't. The first is that the cost of

12 objecting is sometimes more than the benefit of

13 excluding the claim. These are nuisance-value claims.

14 They often will acquiesce in a legitimate payout simply

15 to avoid the nuisance value of the objection, which I

16 think is unfair.

17 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is there a big cost

18 in -- in filing an objection?

19 MR. GEYSER: According to -- to the National

20 Association of Bankruptcy Attorneys, it often takes two

21 to three hours to do all the paperwork, serve the

22 parties. It might not seem like very much, but that --

23 that does impose a cost on the system.

24 The other reason that the trustees --

25 JUSTICE ALITO: I can't believe you couldn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 even have -- you could have a computer program that does 2 this automatically. I can't understand why it would be 3 very difficult. 4 MR. GEYSER: Your Honor, even if it took 5 only an hour, you're talking about hundreds of thousands 6 of claims filed each year, which, in the aggregate, 7 amounts to an awful lot of time. 8 The other reason that the trustees -9 JUSTICE ALITO: But how many of these would 10 there be in the typical Chapter 13? 11 MR. GEYSER: What -- what we've seen in at 12 least the cases that have had a chance to go past the 13 pleading stage is that the trustee, for example, the 14 Middle District of Alabama processes between 6 and 7,000 15 claims a month. So to review the claims, they have to 16 review a claim every two minutes for 365 days a year -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what kind of 18 claims are you talking about? These -- these kinds of 19 claims? 20 MR. GEYSER: Well, claims filed in the 21 bankruptcy. But the -- the point is Congress wanted to 22 limit the bankruptcy process to legitimate claims. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then it's 24 logistically, it's every claim that they -- they look 25 at?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 MR. GEYSER: That -- those are the claims 2 that they have to sort through. And I don't -- I -3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't tell us 4 very much about how many of these claims there are. 5 MR. GEYSER: Well, sometimes we don't know 6 how many claims of these nature there are because 7 sometimes they slip through and no one notices them. 8 And the other reason that the trustees don't 9 always object, Justice Alito, and they've told us 10 this -- the -- the Chapter 13 trustees at page 15 of 11 their brief, there -- there's an information asymmetry. 12 Trustees assume that creditors act in good faith. So 13 they assume if there's a facially time-barred claim, 14 it's possible the creditor is aware of some basis for 15 tolling. And the trustee doesn't know what the creditor 16 is thinking, and so they might not object, which is a 17 way that these claims are, in fact, misleading, even to 18 sophisticated trustees. 19 So the real point is that Midland wouldn't 20 file these claims if the system actually functioned the 21 way that Congress intended. If -- if it did function 22 and everyone objected the way they were supposed to, 23 these claims would always lose. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: I find this is a very 25 difficult case because if -- if your description of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
42 1 Midland's business model is correct, it doesn't seem to 2 me that it has much, if any, social utility. 3 On the other hand, I have real a problem 4 with your -- with fitting your argument into the concept 5 of an affirmative defense. I thought an affirmative 6 defense was a rule of law that may allow the defendant 7 to prevail if the defendant asserts the defense. But 8 you want to switch -- you're switching that over to the 9 side of the plaintiff or the person filing the claim. 10 It seems inconsistent with the whole idea of an 11 affirmative defense. 12 The idea of an affirmative defense -- let's 13 take statute of limitations. The idea is that the 14 defendant may escape liability based on the statute of 15 limitations, but only if a defendant asserts the defense 16 and, if necessary, proves it. And if a defendant 17 doesn't do that, then the law is perfectly content with 18 having a recovery on a claim that would have otherwise 19 been time barred. 20 MR. GEYSER: Well, I -- I think that, again, 21 we're -- we're not talking about affirmative defenses 22 that aren't obvious on the face of the -- of the claim. 23 Under Rule 9011 -- and -- and just thinking about the 24 way a creditor would normally approach this, if they 25 look and they realize there's a facially obvious time
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
43 1 bar -- this case is a great example. The debt's over a 2 decade old. They missed the limitations period by 3 almost five years on a six-year limitation period. They 4 almost doubled the -- the length of time they had to 5 file. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: In this case, is it -- is 7 there something in the record? I mean, it's rather 8 surprising to me that there is a company and their 9 business model, you say, is to go around buying up debts 10 that can't be enforced and are worthless, and then 11 filing cases hoping that no one will notice. Is that 12 shown in the record? I mean, is somebody -- they admit 13 that's their business model? Where does this come from? 14 MR. GEYSER: Your Honor, I think it comes 15 from -- first, this was dismissed on the pleadings, so 16 we can develop it in the case. But it comes from the 17 FTC report that analyzed the data of debt collectors 18 and -19 JUSTICE BREYER: The FTC says that's what 20 they did. 21 MR. GEYSER: It says they buy debts for 22 pennies on the dollar. The amount of the debt -23 JUSTICE BREYER: Why didn't the FTC then 24 bring an action against them if that's what they're 25 doing?
Alderson Reporting Company

44 1 MR. GEYSER: Well, the government sometimes 2 does. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: We then have the FTC that 4 could do such a thing. We have the sanctions in the 5 Bankruptcy Code, and now you want this, too? 6 MR. GEYSER: Congress wanted this, too. The 7 entire purpose of the FDCPA is to use the private 8 attorney general function to police professional debt 9 collector misconduct. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have been 11 able to find only one judge who has been able to get 12 around 911's limitation. 911 is the sanctioning power, 13 right? 14 MR. GEYSER: That's correct. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have to, like Rule 16 11, give notice to the other side that they're 17 violating, right? 18 MR. GEYSER: That's correct. 19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if they withdraw the 20 claim at that point, there's no sanctions, right? 21 MR. GEYSER: That -- that's right. 22 Unless -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's only one judge I 24 found in the bankruptcy context who has used his 25 inherent powers. But that's a rare action where a judge

1 resorts to inherent powers.

45

2 MR. GEYSER: That's exactly --

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This model -- this model

4 is beautiful. You file a claim you know is old. If you

5 get paid, wonderful. If somebody objects, you withdraw

6 it. There's no sanction that's possible.

7 MR. GEYSER: That's correct.

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it just keeps on

9 going.

10 MR. GEYSER: It -- it does. And that's

11 exactly why you need the FDCPA as a backstop and why

12 Congress designed it as an overlay to existing remedies

13 calibrated for general creditors. And we know that

14 Midland in fact does do exactly what you've described.

15 They file a time-barred claim. They're caught. Someone

16 moves for sanctions. They withdraw the claim. And

17 it -- it's a great system, but it's not exactly what

18 Congress intended in the Code.

19 And just to respond, there is no benefit to

20 including these time-barred claims in the Code, as Chief

21 Judge Wood explained in her Seventh Circuit dissent.

22 The time bar is virtually exactly the same as a

23 discharge injunction in the broadest majority of cases.

24 Debtors often don't list time-barred debts on their

25 schedules because they don't care about them. No one

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little hard for --

4 to imagine how to write a opinion to say that the law is

5 a trap for the unwary. But that's -- that's in effect

6 what you want us to say.

7 MR. GEYSER: Oh, not at all, Your Honor.

8 Our law is actually -- our rule is exactly the opposite.

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The uncounseled person

10 gets a notice of -- of demand for payment. The

11 uncounseled person doesn't know about a statute of

12 limitations. So it's a trap for the unwary. But the

13 law makes that trap. That's my problem.

14 MR. GEYSER: Well, the FDCPA exists to

15 protect the uncounseled person to avoid -- I'm sorry.

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your

17 sentence.

18 MR. GEYSER: -- to avoid the trap for the

25 MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Justice, and may it please the Court:

47

2 In our view, no creditor is entitled to file

3 a proof of claim in bankruptcy on a claim that the

4 creditor knows is time barred. When the bankruptcy

5 system works --

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that also true in a

7 civil action generally, forget bankruptcy?

8 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. In our view, in all

9 five court of appeals that considered the issue have

10 held --

11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if a -- if a creditor

12 files suit on a debt that's time barred, the defendant

13 doesn't raise it. The judge said, I hereby grant an

14 award of $10,000 for the debt and I sanction you for

15 Rule 11 -- under Rule 11.

16 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, that's not -- there

17 are lots of situations where a prevailing party can be

18 sanctioned for litigation conduct. Under Rule 11, a --

19 a district court judge has great discretion about

20 whether to award sanctions, and there might be reason

21 not to do so.

22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that a plausible

23 scenario? In other words, the -- the law allows

24 recovery, but you sanction the attorney for getting it?

25 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think it may be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
48 1 that most district courts would not -- would choose not 2 to exercise their discretion by awarding sanctions. 3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that that is 4 -- that that is a plausible exercise of Rule 11 power? 5 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, let me -- let me put 6 it this way. You can imagine -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: To sanction someone 8 because they prevailed in a case. 9 MS. HARRINGTON: I think it's -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's without any 11 misleading. All they've done is file a suit. 12 MS. HARRINGTON: I think it is plausible, 13 but unlikely to happen. But if -- but if you can think 14 about it more broadly. If you can imagine a system 15 where a plaintiff was permitted and entitled, in 16 Petitioner's words, to come in and throw up any possible 17 legal argument no matter how frivolous, and the burden 18 was on the defendant to shoot all of those arguments 19 down, that is not the system that we have adopted. Rule 20 11, every court of appeals to consider the issue has 21 suggested -- has held that Rule 11 requires a party to 22 certify that it has done a reasonable investigation and 23 has a good faith-basis for believing that its claims are 24 warranted by law. Every court of appeals that has 25 considered it has said that that includes forebearing
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
49 1 from filing a lawsuit when it is obvious that it is -2 that there's a landscape of defense. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: It's bankruptcy and that's 4 what worries me. Of course there will be a set of 5 claims where the person is behaving pretty badly. But 6 there's a remedy right in the Code. It's called a 7 sanction. Moreover, if they really go around doing 8 this, I don't know why the FTC wouldn't bring a claim 9 saying this is an unfair business practice. So if in 10 fact you say they also have a remedy under this other 11 act, it's quite possible, given the remedies that they 12 have under the other act, that lawyers won't move for 13 sanctions. They won't bother with it. 14 MS. HARRINGTON: Exactly. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: They will go right into 16 court and then we'll have two sets of courts and other 17 people trying to decide the same question. The same 18 problem that was bothering me 15 minutes ago and I'd 19 like to -- I'd like to know what you think of that. 20 MS. HARRINGTON: I'd love to tell you. The 21 exact same thing is true in the general civil litigation 22 context, that there is the possibility of Rule 11 23 sanctions just like there's a possibility of Rule 9011 24 sanctions. In the very statutory findings in the FDCPA, 25 Congress said in our view, existing legal remedies are
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
50 1 not sufficient to deter this kind of conduct from debt 2 collectors. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, bankruptcy is 4 very different. The whole idea is let's get everything 5 here in one place and -- and deal with it, you know, and 6 different priorities and all of that. I think it's much 7 more significant if you have things spinning out of the 8 bankruptcy estate being adjudicated elsewhere than the 9 fact that you might have it as a general matter in -- in 10 district courts. 11 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 12 it's a bedrock principle of bankruptcy that a creditor's 13 rights with respect to a debt are defined by State law. 14 When a debt is time barred, State law has determined 15 that that debt is not judicially enforceable. Nothing 16 in the bankruptcy gives a creditor an extra right to 17 judicially enforce the debt. That's -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you place any weight 19 on this Fair Debt Collection Act being limited to 20 particular kinds of creditors; that is, this is not for 21 your everyday creditor. It is only for these debt 22 collectors. 23 MS. HARRINGTON: That's right, Justice 24 Ginsburg. I want to just emphasize, though, that in the 25 government's view, this case is as much about abuse of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
51 1 bankruptcy as it is about a violation of the FDCPA. The 2 way we think -3 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, then why 4 not -- what about this. It's a little complicated as a 5 solution and so I'm pretty nervous. I don't know that 6 I'd really do this. But you'd say okay. The word in 7 the debt collection act is unfair and where it's in 8 bankruptcy, there's a whole system to decide if it's 9 unfair by people who know about it. So where a 10 bankruptcy court does in fact say that it's unfair and 11 sanctions a party for this unfair behavior. In that 12 case, it's unfair within the meaning of the debt 13 collection act and in that case, you can go and bring 14 your extra remedy. 15 MS. HARRINGTON: So there are two reasons, I 16 think, why that would not work. The first is, as 17 Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there's a safe haven in 18 Rule 9011, just like there is in Rule 11 since 1993 that 19 allows a creditor to withdraw in offending a proof of 20 claim when it's objected to. Now, I just want to point 21 out, if a -- if a creditor really has a basis for -- a 22 good-faith basis for believing that its claim is 23 enforceable, it will presumably assert that in response 24 to an objection. That's not what happened here. 25 But the second is that there is even more
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 reason to be cautious about this in bankruptcy than

52

2 there is in general civil litigation. Because by

3 operation of Rule 3001 of the bankruptcy rules and

4 Section 502 of the Code, a proof of claim, when it's

5 failed, makes the underlying claim presumptively valid.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think this good faith

7 defense is objective or subjective?

8 MS. HARRINGTON: We think it's objective --

9 or it's the same -- it's basically the same.

10 JUSTICE ALITO: It's objective?

11 MS. HARRINGTON: It's objective. All we are

12 doing is saying the same standard that would be applied

13 under Rule 9011 or Rule 11 should be applied here.

14 JUSTICE ALITO: And you said -- take the

15 case of -- this was the third debt collection act.

16 You're just talking about debt collectors. So -- but

17 let's under bankruptcy, you have a single creditor, a

18 person who owns a sandwich shop has a claim. It's -- it

19 turns out that it's clearly barred by the statute of

20 limitations, files that claim. That's sanctionable

21 conduct?

22 MS. HARRINGTON: As a practical matter, it

23 probably wouldn't be because they would withdraw.

24 JUSTICE ALITO: As legal matter, it would be

25 under your interpretation.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
53 1 MS. HARRINGTON: If they didn't have a 2 good-faith basis for believing that the limitations 3 period didn't apply in that case because of tolling or 4 some other equitable principle -5 JUSTICE ALITO: Subjective. They were 6 acting in perfect good faith subjectively, but not 7 objectively. 8 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, Rule 9011 requires a 9 lawyer or another party to certify they have done a 10 reasonable investigation and have a good-faith basis for 11 believing that their claims are warranted by existing 12 law. And so if they haven't done that reasonable 13 investigation or if they have ignored the results of 14 that investigation, which must have been happened here, 15 then they violated Rule 9011 and engaged in unfair and 16 misleading practices. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other 18 affirmative defenses does your theory apply to? 19 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, think about freedom 20 from the defense of res judicata. If a creditor had 21 sued in state claim on a timely -- a timely debt, and 22 the state court had said: This is not a valid claim. 23 We wouldn't want a system where that creditor could then 24 file a proof of claim in bankruptcy, hoping that the 25 claim would just slip through the cracks and get paid

1 even though the creditor knew for sure --

54

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A lot of these

3 affirmative defenses though in -- aren't presented as

4 abstractly as that. They may involve nuances.

5 We have cases about the scope of res

6 judicata and when it applies. What other -- I assume

7 your argument applies to every affirmative defense.

8 MS. HARRINGTON: Only if it's obvious, and

9 if the creditor doesn't -- is able to access all the

10 information without discovery. That's the rule that's

11 been applied in the Rule 11 context --

12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Rule applies to every

13 affirmative defense.

14 MS. HARRINGTON: Every obvious affirmative

15 defense where the creditor or the plaintiff --

16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any nonobvious

17 affirmative defenses to which it wouldn't apply?

18 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I think something

19 like contributory negligence may be kind of a classic

20 affirmative defense that would be -- it would be hard

21 to -- to say that the plaintiff in the civil litigation

22 had an --

23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How about a lack -- lack

24 of personal jurisdiction?

25 MS. HARRINGTON: Lack -- I mean, I guess it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 depends on the circumstances. If there's -- if the

55

2 creditor --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You know -- you know there

4 is no personal jurisdiction, but you filed a -- filed a

5 suit anyway, and the Rule says that -- that it has --

6 you have to make an objection.

7 MS. HARRINGTON: I don't think that would

8 arise in a bankruptcy context, but in a civil litigation

9 context --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about just --

11 as ordinary civil litigation.

12 MS. HARRINGTON: I think if -- what I would

13 say is if the Court could sanction that under Rule 11,

14 then we think --

15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the ordinary civil

16 litigation, the defendant can always consent to personal

17 jurisdiction. So it's -- it's --

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And he can always consent

19 to the waiving of the statute of limitations by not

20 raising it.

21 MS. HARRINGTON: But -- but not in

22 bankruptcy because it's -- if it -- the debtor cannot

23 consent to the -- to the payment of a time-barred claim

24 because that takes money away from other creditors --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't they consent?

Suppose the plan is a company that does 3 business in countries -- I know you don't believe there 4 are such countries, but there are, there are countries 5 where it's a matter of honor to pay a debt. And people 6 actually do pay debts. 7 (Laughter.) 8 MR. HARRINGTON: I believe that. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you could -10 it's easy to think of cases. 11 MS.

HARRINGTON: Because it -22 JUSTICE BREYER: But regardless of that 23 dispute. 24 MS. HARRINGTON: Okay. This -25 JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is -- is the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 automatic stay applied to these actions or not?

57

2 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. In our view these are

3 claims within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so they can't proceed

5 in the -- the -- under the ^ cap? debt act until the

6 bankruptcy is over.

7 MS. HARRINGTON: That's true, yes.

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

9 MS. HARRINGTON: And -- and also, you know,

10 in terms of the discharge, the FDCPA gives the debtor

11 the right to ask not to be contacted any more by a debt

12 collector, which is basically the functional equivalent

13 of a discharge, and the anti-discrimination provisions

14 apply to any dischargeable debt, not just debt that has

15 been discharged, and so that would apply to these -- to

16 these types of debts.

17 And so I just think it -- there is nothing

18 in the code that gives a creditor the right to try to

19 sneak one through when the creditor knows that if it's

20 objected to, it should be disallowed --

21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Is your argument --

22 MS. HARRINGTON: -- 100 percent of the time.

23 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- dependent on a view of

24 the code that precludes these kinds of claims?

25 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
58 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: So if -- if one looked at 2 the code and said, well, it seems as though these kinds 3 of claims, although unenforceable, can be filed, if that 4 was your view of the code, what do you think follows 5 from that? 6 MS. HARRINGTON: So then I think it would 7 not be unfair and it would not misleading, and if I'd 8 like -- if I could, I'd like to tell you why. It's -9 the reason it's unfair here is because the creditor does 10 not have a right to get paid in bankruptcy on this type 11 of claim and so it's unfair to try to do that and to put 12 the other participants to the burden of making sure that 13 it doesn't happen. 14 It's misleading because when you file a 15 proof of claim under Rule 9011 you're making an implicit 16 representation -- may I finish my sentence? That you 17 have done a reasonable investigation and have a good 18 faith basis for believing that the claim is warranted. 19 If it is warranted under the Bankruptcy Code then that's 20 not misleading. 21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 22 Three minutes, Mr. Shanmugam. 23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 25 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Mr. Chief Justice.

59

2 Just two points on rebuttal. First, I

3 think, with all due respect, the Court should be

4 concerned about the breadth of Respondent's position,

5 and let me lay out circumstances that I think would be

6 covered by Respondent's rule.

7 A circumstance in which a claim has been

8 discharged in a previous bankruptcy, a circumstance, in

9 which a claim has in fact actually been paid off. A

10 circumstance in which the claim is subject to a setoff,

11 or a circumstance in which the creditor simply gets the

12 wrong amount or the wrong person. These circumstances,

13 I'm reliably informed, recur with some frequency in

14 bankruptcy proceedings, and yet, in all of those

15 circumstances, after an objection is raised and the

16 claim is disallowed. There could be a claim that the

17 claim itself was false or misleading under the FDCPA,

18 and a holding in Respondent's favor would really be a

19 recipe for clogging the courts with these sorts of FDCPA

20 claims.

21 And I would note, parenthetically, that to

22 the extent the Respondent and the government's argument

23 presupposes some absence of a good faith basis for

24 believing that some of these objections are invalid.

25 That's very hard to reconcile with the language of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 FDCPA because if there is one established principle

60

2 about the operation of the FDCPA, it is that there is no

3 affirmative state of mind requirement. And so what

4 Respondent and the government would be asking you to do

5 is to say, sure, there could be a prima facie claim

6 under the FDCPA, but the only way in which a creditor

7 could escape liability would be to invoke the

8 affirmative defense in Section 1692k paragraph c, where

9 the violation is not intentional and results from a bona

10 fide error which requires the maintenance of procedures

11 reasonably calculated to avoid that error.

12 And so, again, this is going to be a recipe

13 for bringing these FDCPA actions into play, and many,

14 many bankruptcies.

15 And that leads me to my second point, which

16 is that this Court has never applied the FDCPA within

17 the four corners of a bankruptcy proceeding, and I think

18 that the problem with doing so here is that it really

19 doesn't address the principle concern that Respondent

20 and the government raises, and let me give you an

21 example as to why that's true.

22 Suppose you have a bank that holds credit

23 card debt, and that bank actually doesn't sell that debt

24 on to a debt collector. Well, that bank could do the

25 very same thing. It could file a proof of claim, it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 would be required to disclose that there is a prima

61

2 facie limitations defense, and yet, if that bank does

3 not qualify as a debt collector under the definition of

4 the FDCPA. FDCPA liability would not be available, and

5 that simply illustrates the fact that this is really a

6 problem, if it is, in fact, a problem, with the

7 operation of bankruptcy, and it's a problem that

8 Congress or the advisory committee are -- are best

9 situated to remedy, and so, for instance, if there is

10 concern about the limitations defense, one solution is

11 to eliminate the fact that that's a defense, and for

12 Congress to shift the burden back on to the creditor.

13 But, again, that's a remedy in the particular context of

14 bankruptcy.

15 And just to address, finally, the

16 government's broader argument about the sanctionability

17 of conduct outside bankruptcy. This Court has never

18 held that it would be a violation of Rule 11 for a

19 plaintiff to file a complaint in the face of an obvious

20 defense, whether it's a limitations defense or some

21 other type of defense. And notwithstanding the rather

22 cursory analysis in the court of appeals' cases that

23 Respondent and the government cites, I would

24 respectfully submit that that would be an astonishing

25 proposition for civil litigants if this Court were to

Alderson Reporting Company

62

2 against -- across the full range of litigation.
