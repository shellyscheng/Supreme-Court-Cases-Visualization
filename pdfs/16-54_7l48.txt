3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (11:08 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 next in case 16-54, Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions. 5 Mr. Fisher. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 The key statutory term of the INA in this 11 case is the word "abuse." And the Federal statute 12 criminalizing sexual abuse of a minor, as well as the 13 State statutes dealing with the same subject, dictate 14 that sexual relations become abuse only -- on account of 15 age, only when the younger partner in the activity is 16 younger than 16. 17 At the very least, the Federal and State 18 laws that I just mentioned dictate that California 19 statute is well outside of that which Congress would 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm -21 MR. FISHER: -- have expected. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher. You 23 just said something that I think you did not say in your 24 briefs, so let me ask you about that. 25 You just gave us your definition of what the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 generic offense is. It's understand 16. Because I

4

2 understood in your briefs you just said whatever the

3 generic offense is, it doesn't include this activity.

4 But do you have a definition of what the generic offense

5 is? And if so, did you just say it?

6 MR. FISHER: Justice Kagan, what we think is

7 that if you want to give a definition for sexual abuse

8 of a minor, at least in the context of the allegation of

9 abuse being due to age, that 16 would be the appropriate

10 cutoff. And we do say that in our reply brief in

11 response to the government's point that, at least its

12 arguments, that you need to go further than we argued in

13 our blue brief.

14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have any further

15 views of what the generic offense is? Are there other

16 elements of the generic offense that you're willing to

17 tell us you think? I mean usually, in these cases,

18 first we define the generic offense, and then we see

19 whether the State statute in question fits within that

20 or doesn't.

21 And so what is the generic offense? It's

22 under 16. Anything else?

23 MR. FISHER: There are four elements,

24 Justice Kagan. There -- it has to be sexual in nature,

25 it has to be abuse, has to involve a minor, and then

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 presumably there's some mens rea involved. I think

5

2 those are four elements.

3 And so what we think is enough to decide

4 this case -- in fact, it's more than is necessary to

5 decide this case -- is to say, when dealing with the

6 elements of abuse, and the allegation is solely because

7 of the ages of the partners engaging in sexual relations

8 you have abuse, then 16 should be the age of consent.

9 Now, we didn't go that far in parts of our

10 briefing because we don't think the Court has to go that

11 far. In Duenas-Alvarez and other cases are examples

12 where the Court has said, we'll just look at a

13 particular element and say that as long as the State

14 statute falls outside of that element, that's enough.

15 So you could decide this case by saying that the seven

16 states that have laws like California's, at issue here,

17 but draw the age of consent at 18, automatically fall

18 outside of sexual abuse of a minor. And, remember, even

19 the seven states that have those laws, most of them are

20 misdemeanors, and only one of those seven states calls

21 that conduct abuse.

22 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that there were

23 no -- that the definition here -- the phrase here had no

24 criminal application. So it applies purely in

25 immigration; okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 MR. FISHER: Uh-huh.

6

2 JUSTICE ALITO: And you're not asking us to

3 overrule Chevron.

4 MR. FISHER: No, no, no.

5 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. So why wouldn't

6 this phrase, "sexual abuse of a minor," be a phrase that

7 is sufficiently ambiguous to justify Chevron? Now, in

8 order to get around that, do you have to invoke

9 something like the rule of lenity?

10 MR. FISHER: No. We have other arguments,

11 Justice Alito.

12 JUSTICE ALITO: So that -- that is not an

13 ambiguous phrase by itself, "sexual abuse of a minor"?

14 MR. FISHER: Not in the way you've defined

15 "ambiguity," both in the categorical approach cases and

16 for purposes of Chevron. So let me turn to those one by

17 one.

18 In the categorical approach cases, starting

19 with Taylor, when the Court had confronted a generic

20 crime without a specific cross-reference definition,

21 what the Court has done is look across the sweep of

22 State laws and Federal laws criminalizing that conduct.

23 In a case like Perrin, where there were 42 states that

24 had a common core definition, the Court explicitly said

25 in a footnote in that case there's no ambiguity involved

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 in that situation, because we assume it's sufficiently 2 clear that that's what Congress would have been 3 intending to cover. 4 Even if I didn't win that argument -5 JUSTICE ALITO: But you think that if we 6 look at this incredible array of State laws, it becomes 7 clear what Congress intended by "sexual abuse of a 8 minor"? 9 MR. FISHER: Well, we think "yes" for two 10 reasons. One is because, remember, Justice Alito, in 11 the very legislation this provision in the INA was 12 enacted, Congress amended Section 2243 of the criminal 13 code that uses precisely the same language, "sexual 14 abuse of a minor." So it is a precise definition in 15 Federal criminal law when Congress was criminalizing 16 this conduct. So I think the Court could actually hold 17 that is enough right there to find no ambiguity and to 18 find a common -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, before -20 before you continue your answer and get into Chevron, 21 why -- suppose that there were -- the Federal statute is 22 the only one on the books. All the other State statutes 23 are -- are different. Would the Federal statute then 24 control, still? 25 MR. FISHER: I think that would be a harder
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
8 1 case, Justice Kennedy. What you'd have to ask in that 2 situation is, did you have an explicit or implicit 3 cross-reference? Is there strong-enough reason to 4 believe in that hypothetical that Congress was thinking 5 of only the Federal version of the crime? I think there 6 are strong reasons here to think that, for the reasons I 7 was just describing. But this is the easy case, Justice 8 Kennedy. So -9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But why would you think 10 that, Mr. Fisher? I mean, there -- in this statute, 11 there are loads of cross-references. And this one is 12 not a cross-reference. So doesn't that tell us 13 something? 14 MR. FISHER: It's -- it's -- it's a canon, 15 Justice Kagan. I -- I will concede that. But the -16 the immigration defense brief at page 13 posits a theory 17 as to why Congress may not have included a 18 cross-reference here where it did other places, and it 19 has to do with the jurisdictional nature of the element 20 in the Federal crime. 21 But even if you set that aside, what you 22 have is one canon, and you have other canons and another 23 canon that's very strong through the Court's cases. And 24 when Congress uses the identical phrase multiple places 25 in the same legislation, we assume it meant the same
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 thing.

9

2 And so that would be my argument, primarily,

3 as to why Congress here may well have been thinking of

4 Section 2243. But as I was just describing to Justice

5 Kennedy, this is the easy case. This is the case where

6 Section 2243 and the State multi-jurisdictional survey

7 plus the Model Penal Code leads you to the exact same

8 place. So it's enough in this case to say, at least

9 where those two things line up, it is certainly the case

10 that Congress would not have been intending to sweep in

11 a State statute like the one involved here.

12 You can leave for another day what might

13 happen in a hypothetical statute like Justice Kennedy

14 described, or even on this statute if you had a

15 situation where states covered certain conduct and

16 treated it as abuse that falls outside of Section 2243.

17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do we do with

18 Chevron if we think it's ambiguous?

19 MR. FISHER: So --

20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it's not clear?

21 MR. FISHER: If you think -- I want to make

22 sure I understand the question. If you think that the

23 text is not clear for the reasons I've described so

24 far --

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 MR. FISHER: Then you would go -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or sufficiently 3 unambiguous, to be -4 MR. FISHER: Fair enough. 5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to be clear. 6 MR. FISHER: Then what I think you would do 7 is have one more set of questions you ask before you ask 8 the traditional Chevron reasonableness questions. And 9 that would be whether a traditional -- another 10 traditional canon of construction resolves the 11 ambiguity. 12 The Solicitor General acknowledges at 13 page 42 of its brief that other clear statement rules 14 and, of course, juris prudence, like the presumption 15 against preemption, the presumption against 16 retroactivity, come before you get to agency deference. 17 Likewise here, there are two such canons. 18 One is the rule of lenity, which Justice Alito 19 mentioned. And we think for the reasons in 20 Thompson-Center Arms Company and more recently in the 21 Abramski case, you have the separation of powers problem 22 by deferring on Chevron grounds to a statute like this 23 one that applies both in the civil and criminal realm. 24 And, secondly, even if you set that aside -25 and I think that was Justice Alito's hypothetical --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 then you'd have the -- the long-standing rule on

11

2 immigration law, which predates Chevron by decades, that

3 says deportation statutes, if they're ambiguous, should

4 be construed in the favor of the --

5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but we've

6 always said, though, that the rule of lenity, or at

7 least most often said that the rule of lenity is

8 something you apply when you've already exhausted the

9 normal tools of statutory interpretation. So why is the

10 order of a battle the other way around? Why do you

11 apply the rule of lenity before you get to Chevron?

12 MR. FISHER: Well, I think you've said more

13 or less the same thing in the Chevron context, Mr. Chief

14 Justice. And the two things that I would cite to you

15 are, first, the Thompson-Center Arms Company case where

16 the Court said, we have an ambiguous statute, and now

17 we're going to turn to lenity, not to Chevron. And the

18 reason why is because in Chevron itself, the Court said

19 you exhaust all traditional canons because you assume

20 Congress legislated against those canons. There is no

21 more traditional canon of construction than the criminal

22 rule of lenity.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I --

24 MR. FISHER: I --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I don't know how

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
12 1 the two of them can coexist. I mean, on the one hand, 2 you have in Chevron, you give the agency the broadest 3 possible deference to interpret an ambiguous provision. 4 And in the rule of lenity, you say, well, if it's 5 ambiguous, you don't apply it as strictly as -- as the 6 government may be arguing. They each point in the 7 opposite direction based on the same predicate, which is 8 a degree of ambiguity in the statutory provision. 9 MR. FISHER: I think that premise is 10 correct. And I think the Abramski case, from just a 11 couple of terms ago, answers that problem by saying it 12 would be a separation of powers violation to let the 13 executive define -- define criminal statutes. Remember, 14 we -15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Are you suggesting, 16 Mr. Fisher, that if we turn Chevron off, we have to turn 17 lenity on? Couldn't there be a middle ground between 18 the two; in other words, some space where you say, 19 because of this -- the -- the criminal application of 20 this statute, we don't apply ordinary Chevron deference, 21 but at the same time, we don't go straight into the kind 22 of grievous ambiguity that -- that triggers lenity? 23 There's some middle area where the Court gets to decide 24 just what is -- it thinks is the best construction of 25 the statute?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
13 1 MR. FISHER: It's hard for me to imagine 2 exactly how that works, but I'm happy with the -3 JUSTICE KAGAN: It works -- it works, if you 4 think that ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean the same 5 thing for Chevron purposes and for lenity purposes. 6 MR. FISHER: I would -7 JUSTICE KAGAN: The lenity purposes really 8 demands grievous ambiguity, and but there's some sense 9 in which there's -- there's a of lack clarity, a lack of 10 clear meaning that allows the Court to decide what the 11 best interpretation of the language is. 12 MR. FISHER: So if that were the situation 13 here, what I would tell the Court is when you do that 14 job as a court, you should take into account for any 15 ambiguity the rule against construing deportation 16 statutes against noncitizens. And, more generally, what 17 you should -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't really understand 19 that -- that canon, because that canon would suggest 20 that we never give the BIA deference as to its 21 interpretation of this statute. And, in fact, when it 22 comes to noncriminal things, we give the BIA very 23 substantial deference. 24 MR. FISHER: You have in other parts of the 25 INA, Justice Kagan. But the Court never deferred to the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 INA in terms of construing what an aggravated felony is 2 for purposes of deportation. And in the same sphere, 3 the Court said that that canon applied in -- with 4 respect to, quote, deportation statutes. But even if 5 you set that aside and just -- I'd be more than happy 6 for the Court simply to ask what the best reading of 7 this statute is on its own terms. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I take you back to 9 the -- the argument that Chevron isn't appropriate here 10 because the definition applies in both the criminal and 11 the civil context? And that was the point that Judge 12 Sutton made in his dissent, and it has kind of a -- it's 13 an appealing argument when you say it fast. But the 14 more I think of it, the less sense -15 (Laughter.) 16 JUSTICE ALITO: -- the less sense it makes. 17 Now suppose that a -- there's an ambiguous 18 phrase in an immigration statute, and it applies only in 19 the civil -- it applies only in immigration and has no 20 criminal -- has no criminal applications. And suppose 21 that in that situation it would be appropriate to use 22 Chevron, okay, and then later Congress uses the same 23 phrase in a criminal statute. 24 Does that mean that the Chevron 25 deference that was applied in the civil -- previously in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 the civil context goes away?

15

2 MR. FISHER: I think it --

3 JUSTICE ALITO: I -- I don't see anything

4 odd about having the same phrase interpreted using a

5 different methodology in a civil case and in a criminal

6 case.

7 MR. FISHER: I think it would go away and,

8 Justice Alito, I just cite this Court's case law to you.

9 Clark against Martinez is the foremost example, but

10 there's Thompson Center Arms Company. There are decades

11 ago, FCC against ABC, and the Court has said over and

12 over again that statutes are not chameleons.

13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well -- but I would like to

14 know why it makes sense, so something other than a

15 citation of cases, why would Chevron deference be

16 appropriate up to the point where Congress decides to

17 use the same phrase in a criminal statute and then it

18 disappears.

19 MR. FISHER: Because it would violate the

20 separation of powers. Congress creates --

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.

22 MR. FISHER: -- similar --

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does -- I -- I --

24 I -- I'm having some of the difficulty that Justice

25 Alito is having, but just last term we decided a Fair

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Labor Standards Act case involving car salesmen --

16

2 MR. FISHER: Uh-huh.

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- car repairs, that was

4 the dispute.

5 In that Act, a willful violation can be

6 criminally prosecuted. And yet we gave -- we talked

7 about Chevron as applying to that act and the board's

8 interpretation and sent it back for the board to give us

9 a proper reading of the statute or explain its reading.

10 How many statutes, administrative statutes

11 today, don't include a criminal sanction?

12 MR. FISHER: It's --

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in part or in whole?

14 Almost all of them do. So where would Chevron be then?

15 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure empirically that's

16 correct. I think it's more of an unusual situation, but

17 here's what I would say about the kinds of cases I think

18 you're thinking of, Justice Sotomayor, where the Court

19 hasn't even thought about this issue, and the reason why

20 is because in those cases Congress has made it a crime

21 to violate a regulation issued by whatever agency has

22 control over that statute. So there Congress has

23 defined the crime, which is violating a regulation.

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But --

25 MR. FISHER: Here --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
17 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- most of the 2 regulations are interpretations of the statute. 3 MR. FISHER: That's right, but Congress has 4 created the crime of violating the regulation. Just 5 like if Congress says it's a crime to violate a court 6 order and the court issues an order, the court isn't 7 creating criminal law. Congress did. 8 I don't want to hang my whole case on the 9 Chevron question. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but it is -- but it's 11 why I think people are discussing it and I may have -12 MR. FISHER: Yeah. 13 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to accept my 14 view. My -- I may be the only one with this view, but 15 it -- and I'm curious to know what you actually think 16 about it. You have cases here a lot. 17 Chevron is not the tax code. We are not -18 it is not a rule of tax law. It is a general kind of 19 standard which has judges asking what Congress would 20 have thought about a question they never thought about, 21 which is what kind of deference should a court give to 22 an agency interpretation, and the answer will vary 23 depending upon statute. 24 I would not even give you this lecture were 25 it not for the case that I believe this Court wrote this
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 view into its opinion in Mead, which I think is pretty 2 good law. And so if you're asking the question what 3 would a reasonable legislature think about that 4 question, which he never thought of, it's surprising to 5 me that he would think prosecutors should have deference 6 as to what the statute that they are prosecuting 7 somebody under means. I would find that surprising. 8 I would find surprising some aspects of 9 immigration law where the result is just about as bad. 10 The result is they leave without any discretion to keep 11 them here. And then I'd proceed case by case. 12 But I'm not asking what I think. I already 13 know. I want to know what you think. 14 MR. FISHER: What -- what I think and what 15 we're asking for today, if the Court reached the 16 question, is for a very small exception to Chevron. A 17 carveout to the extent it doesn't already exist in this 18 Court's law. I think it already does exist, but if it 19 didn't, it should, and that is where a statute has 20 criminal applications and Congress has not delegated to 21 the agency the authority to create crimes through its 22 own regulatory process, Chevron is off limits. It would 23 be very, very hard -24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm 25 still having a problem as to why that distinction is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 meaningful.

19

2 MR. FISHER: The reason --

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I -- most of the

4 crimes that are -- are set out in regulation almost

5 largely parrot the statutory language. And then explain

6 what the agency means and it makes it a crime to violate

7 the regulation which is really the statute. So it's a

8 distinction without meaning for me.

9 MR. FISHER: So two -- so two things about

10 that situation, Justice Sotomayor. The first is, if

11 you're just parroting the statutory language you don't

12 need Chevron at all, and the second answer is, if you

13 get to -- the only thing that matters is where the

14 agency is reading a statute under Chevron in a way that

15 is not the better reading. And in that situation almost

16 all the --

17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's if its

18 reading unreasonable.

19 MR. FISHER: Almost all -- that's right.

20 Almost all the examples you're thinking of are ones

21 where Congress has delegated the authority to create

22 crimes through the regulatory process.

23 Now, you don't have to reach that question

24 in this case. For all the reasons I started with, the

25 statute is unambiguously clear as the question presented

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
20 1 in this case. The California statute falls far outside 2 of what Federal law, the sweep of State laws, the amount 3 of penal code define sexual abuse of a minor. 4 Even if you were going to ask the question 5 under the traditional lens of Chevron, was the BIA 6 analysis reasonable, here I think it's helpful to point 7 out a few things. First is, the BIA in its definition 8 of sexual abuse of a minor looked to a different Federal 9 statute, Section 3509, which is a State -- which is a 10 section about witness testimony. This goes back to the 11 Rodriguez-Rodriguez case in 1999. 12 The Solicitor General no longer defends that 13 analysis, so the core of the BIA's reasoning that led it 14 to where we are today is something that is not being 15 defended anymore in this Court. So that's the first 16 thing. 17 The second thing is the BIA totally ignored 18 the State by State sweep, just saying that the lack of a 19 definition isn't enough in the statute itself, but that 20 runs directly into the Taylor case, into Duenas-Alvarez, 21 into all the other categorical approach cases where the 22 Court has said to -- to define a -- a generic crime, you 23 start and see if there's an express definition, but if 24 there isn't that's when you do multi-jurisdictional 25 surveys.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 The other reason --

21

2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Multi-jurisdictional

3 survey would yield age 16?

4 MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, there are

5 two -- there would be two possible answers to your

6 multi-jurisdictional survey. The first and the easiest

7 answer is that any State statute like California

8 creating a -- a -- an 18 age of consent with a minor age

9 differential, a very small age differential, would be

10 well outside of the mainstream and 43 states do not even

11 criminalize the conduct at issue here, let alone make it

12 a serious crime.

13 Remember, we're asking at the end of the day

14 whether something's an aggravated felony, not just

15 whether it's criminal. You have an extraordinary case

16 here where the -- where the government is trying to

17 deport somebody for committing something that isn't even

18 a crime under Federal and the vast majority of states.

19 And, Justice Ginsburg, the second answer

20 about a multi-jurisdiction -- jurisdictional survey, if

21 you wanted to give more guidance or felt like the

22 Solicitor General's argument did a more comprehensive

23 definition is necessary was correct, would be the one I

24 started with and I talked to Justice Kagan about, which

25 would be, when you're dealing with an allegation of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 abuse based on the ages alone, that 16 is the age of

22

2 consent and that is found in Federal law, it's found in

3 the modal Penal Code, it's found in the sweep of State

4 laws.

5 And, Justice, this is what Judge Wilkinson

6 did for the Fourth Circuit in Rangel-Castenada which is

7 cited in our briefs and we think that decision is

8 correct.

9 Even if what you did what the Solicitor

10 General asked you to do, which is ignore all of that and

11 simply pick up Black's Law Dictionary, as we've shown in

12 our reply brief you end up in the same place, because

13 Black's Law Dictionary, when it defines sexual abuse

14 says that it -- we're talking about illegal sexual

15 activity. And to define what is illegal you have to ask

16 what the age of consent is, and when you look in Black's

17 Law Dictionary, for the age of consent in this

18 situation, you find the number 16.

19 So this is, again, the very easy case where

20 all roads are going to lead you to the same place. You

21 don't have any of the interpretative difficulties of the

22 categorical approach that you normally have.

23 In fact, there's one other way where this is

24 an easier case than almost all categorical approaches

25 cases that you see. And that's because the consequences

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 here are so benign.

23

2 The ordinary categorical approach situation

3 involves a scenario, I think, where what a court is

4 sometimes worried about is that by virtue of the -- the

5 methodology there would be some State statutes that are

6 a little bit overbroad and that people have done some

7 very bad things that the Federal law would consider to

8 be aggravated felonies are going to get the benefit of

9 the way the categorical approach works and not be

10 subject to automatic removal.

11 And here that problem is taken care of in

12 the State laws like -- in the states like California

13 that have laws that reach up to 18, because as we've

14 shown in Footnote 1 of our reply brief, all of those

15 states have other statutory provisions that are in line

16 with the Federal law or very close to it.

17 So really, all you are dealing with this in

18 this case is a few outlier -- there's actually seven

19 outlier statutes that go further than the Federal aw,

20 and that have backup provisions that are going to still

21 allow the Federal government to seek automatic removal

22 or some other immigration remedy against people that

23 commit sexual offenses against minors.

24 Remember, the core -- the core of sexual

25 abuse of a minor, I think, are things like child

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
24 1 molestation and other really horrible things that nobody 2 is even talking about here. The only issue in this case 3 is how it applies to offenses like statutory rape. And 4 we think, working your way up to the Federal definition 5 of statutory rape, when age alone is the only thing that 6 justifies an allegation of abuse is the right way to 7 resolve that case and not go any further. 8 The Federal government's definition, as I 9 point out one more thing about it, it doesn't even track 10 the BIA. It's the Federal government's position, at 11 least as I understand it, is that any sexual activity 12 that's illegal is sexual abuse of a minor, as long as 13 the younger participant is under 18. 14 So under the Federal government's view, as I 15 understand it, the two States that criminalize sex 16 between two 17-year-olds would constitute an aggravated 17 felony. Even though only two States do it, even though 18 it is not commonly thought of in this country as abuse, 19 and even though it's a misdemeanor in both of those 20 situations. That's an extraordinary request out of this 21 Court, and we think goes far, far, far beyond what 22 Congress might have imagined when it was creating sexual 23 abuse of a minor subcategory. 24 If there are any other questions about the 25 presentation I've made thus far, I'm happy to answer

25 1 them. Otherwise, I'd like to reserve the remainder of 2 my time. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 4 Mr. Kedem. 5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM 6 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 7 MR. KEDEM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 8 please the Court: 9 Congress has charged the Attorney General 10 with responsibility to administer the INA to conduct 11 removal proceedings and to render controlling 12 interpretations of the statute within those proceedings. 13 In this case, the Board of Immigration 14 Appeals exercised that authority in a manner both 15 reasonable and consistent with the statute, and for that 16 reason, should be afforded deference. I think perhaps a 17 good place to begin is where Petitioner's counsel began, 18 with the idea of multi-jurisdictional surveys. 19 First of all, by my count, there are roughly 20 13 cases in which this Court, under the categorical 21 approach, was called upon to define or give meaning to a 22 Federal provision so that the categorical approach could 23 be applied to it. 24 In only two of those cases, Taylor and 25 Duenas-Alverez, has the Court relied on something that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
26 1 could be compared to a multi-jurisdictional survey. In 2 all of the other cases, the Court either didn't look at 3 multi-jurisdictional surveys at all or, as in Johnson, 4 basically specifically rejected the relevance of those 5 multi-jurisdictional surveys, saying that they would 6 shed no light on the central inquiry. 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kedem, you don't 8 disagree, do you, with the premise that the first thing 9 that we should do is to define the generic crime; is 10 that right? 11 MR. KEDEM: That's correct. That's what we 12 consider to be step one of the categorical approach. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So you say that's 14 step one. And then you say, well, you define 15 the generic -- in this case you say the generic crime is 16 whatever is illegal under State law. That's one of 17 your -18 MR. KEDEM: That's the first argument that 19 we make in our brief. 20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah. So that seems to be 21 like just not what generic crimes are. 22 MR. KEDEM: Sure. 23 JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, you're just 24 saying, well, it's whatever the States consider illegal, 25 when the whole idea of a generic crime is that it's not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 just anything that's illegal, it's the prototypical

27

2 case, even though that differs from what some States do.

3 MR. KEDEM: Sure. A -- a couple responses.

4 First of all, it's certainly not whatever

5 States make illegal. It still has to have sexual

6 content that's directed at a minor; namely, someone

7 under the age of 18.

8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. But you're carving out

9 one element, which is the age element --

10 MR. KEDEM: Sure.

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and saying whatever a

12 State does goes. So I thought that that was sort of the

13 antithesis of the generic offense approach.

14 MR. KEDEM: I think not, because what we're

15 dealing here is not one crime. What we're dealing here

16 is an umbrella with -- with -- is an umbrella term that

17 applies to several different categories of crime.

18 And I think it's maybe most analogous to the

19 Court's Kawashima case in which the Court was

20 interpreting a provision of the INA's aggravated felony

21 definition, which didn't have a cross reference,

22 offenses involving fraud or deceit, which are sort of a

23 broad category of different types of crimes.

24 And to figure out what that means, the Court

25 did not look to a multi-jurisdictional survey. It

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 looked to the dictionary, to the context of the

28

2 provision, to what it understood to be the -- the

3 purpose of the provision and came up with a definition.

4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now -- now, it looked to

5 Federal law itself 2243(a). We're told that, in the

6 final form, it's the same here as -- as this provision.

7 MR. KEDEM: So --

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The same term, sexual

9 abuse of a minor.

10 MR. KEDEM: A couple -- couple of thoughts

11 about that provision.

12 First of all, it was adopted more than a

13 decade before the term "sexual abuse of a minor" was

14 added to the INA's definition of aggravated felony. It

15 has been amended a number of times, both before and

16 after the amendment that added the aggravated felony of

17 sexual abuse of a minor.

18 And the courts did not do what it did in a

19 number of other provisions, which is to include a cross

20 reference. So if anything, I think the inference is

21 that it did not want to tie the definition of sexual

22 abuse of a minor to that provision.

23 And Petitioner --

24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you think of a

25 definition from -- from an evidentiary statute, a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 statute designed to protect children who testify in

29

2 court. That seems a lot less close than 2243.

3 MR. KEDEM: So I -- I don't think it's

4 accurate to characterize the board's decision as

5 treating that as the definition.

6 And I think if you look at the board's

7 opinion, what it said is that is a pretty common-sense

8 definition for the type of activity that might be

9 covered. But it didn't otherwise rely on it. And the

10 board's decision below relied instead on a practical

11 construction of the word "abuse," the sort of intuition

12 that there are certain types of activity that, even

13 though they are ostensibly consensual, nevertheless,

14 they contain the potential for harm or risk because of

15 something about the relationship between the parties

16 involved, either the ages of the parties involved, or

17 because there's a familial relationship; for instance,

18 parent/child, or there's a relationship of authority or

19 trust, something like a student/teacher.

20 And what it said is when there's a

21 meaningful age difference, such that the perpetrator and

22 victim are not in the same age group, as a result of

23 that, the victim may not be able to advocate for

24 themselves, they may not be able to protect themselves

25 against certain risks, things like pregnancy or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 sexually-transmitted diseases. And that was the basis. 2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't an 18-year-old 3 in the same age group as a 21-year-old? 4 MR. KEDEM: I don't think we're dealing with 5 18-year-olds. I think in all instances we're talking 6 about people under the age of 18. 7 What the -- the board said -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's really like a freshman 9 in college going out with a junior in college. 10 MR. KEDEM: It is true that sometimes there 11 are 17-year-olds who are in college. That's certainly 12 not the typical instance. 13 I think, to a certain extent, we're dealing 14 with a little bit of arbitrariness, no matter where you 15 draw the line. But if you draw the line, as the Federal 16 offense does, you essentially rule out statutes in 17 almost all of the 50 States because, first of all, there 18 are 19 States that set the age of consent either at 18 19 or at 17. So you'd be ruling them -- them out. And 20 most of the remaining ones set the age differential at 21 something less than four years. 22 And that's before you get into questions 23 about things like what about the mens rea? Do you have 24 to know that the victim was of a certain age. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: It's quite complicated,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 which I agree. But do I understand the situation

31

2 correctly? In mid 1990s, Congress passed a law in

3 immigration statute, which is this 1101(a)(43), which

4 lists about 30 or 40 crimes. And it says if the person

5 has committed one of those, goodbye, and the Attorney

6 General can't stop it; is that right?

7 MR. KEDEM: It's right with this one caveat,

8 which is that the definition of aggravated felony

9 actually came much earlier and has been amended a number

10 of times.

11 JUSTICE BREYER: But what happened at that

12 time is they stuck in the words "sexual abuse of a

13 minor."

14 MR. KEDEM: That's correct.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. When they stuck in

16 those words in this long list of crimes, some of which

17 have cross references and some of which, like in that

18 very section, murder, rape, deceit, et cetera, do not.

19 At the time they did that, in 1996 -- I think it was

20 '96, or maybe '95 -- there was on the books a Federal

21 statute which had been passed in 1986. And that Federal

22 statute, by some amazing coincidence, which was a

23 criminal law, is entitled sexual abuse of a minor. And

24 then it has a definition.

25 So why not? And think when they use the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 same word to do about the same thing, list a crime, they 2 meant to pick up the same definition, QED. End of case. 3 All right? Now, why not? 4 MR. KEDEM: First of all, if they intended 5 to do so, it would have been very easy to do what 6 they've done in other provisions, which is to include a 7 cross reference. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Oddly enough -9 MR. KEDEM: At least -10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I can list 10 or 15, 11 including deceit, rape, murder, a whole bunch in this 12 statute -13 MR. KEDEM: Even Petitioner -14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which don't use cross 15 references. 16 MR. KEDEM: Even Petitioner does not claim 17 that sexual abuse of a minor is defined entirely by the 18 bounds of the Federal provision. And they couldn't, 19 because it would lead to some absurd results. 20 For instance, almost all States now, as they 21 did in 1996, have statutes dealing with sexual offenses 22 that are offenses because of a familial relationship, or 23 a relationship of trust or authority, such as 24 student/teacher. None of those offenses are picked up 25 by the Federal provision. And so you'd be disqualifying
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 those as well.

33

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kedem, you have here --

3 you have a federal statute. You have the Model Penal

4 Code, which goes the same way. You have 30-plus State

5 laws. So at the least, am I right that -- that you

6 concede that you can't win unless Chevron applies; is

7 that correct?

8 MR. KEDEM: No, certainly not.

9 JUSTICE KAGAN: You think it's unambiguous,

10 this kind of pragmatic construction about -- what did

11 you say -- like power differentials --

12 MR. KEDEM: No, no. I'm sorry. I didn't

13 mean to suggest that we would win because it's

14 unambiguous that it means only the government's first

15 argument. The point is simply that if you're going to

16 interpret the words that Congress wrote, the

17 interpretation that we put forward, we think, is a much

18 more meaningful one than the one that Petitioners put

19 forward, to the extent that they even offer any.

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: I -- I guess I don't

21 understand that. You're saying that it would be the --

22 the clearly better reading to go -- to -- to say

23 notwithstanding the Federal statute, notwithstanding

24 30-plus State statutes, notwithstanding the Model Penal

25 Code, we just know that when somebody talks about sexual

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 abuse of a minor, they're talking about age 18 with a 2 three-year differential? 3 MR. KEDEM: So I think I would just step 4 back to say that when this Court is giving content to 5 the Federal provision of the first step of the 6 categorical approach, it is engaging in a normal case of 7 statutory interpretation which brings to bear -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm asking -9 MR. KEDEM: -- all of the -10 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- about normal statutory 11 interpretation. 12 MR. KEDEM: The normal -13 JUSTICE KAGAN: The normal statutory 14 interpretation get you to think that out of, like -- out 15 of our heads pops 18 plus a three-year differential -16 MR. KEDEM: I see. So now you're asking 17 about the board's interpretation. 18 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- looking at -- as opposed 19 to looking at 30-plus States, the Model Penal Code, and 20 the Federal statute, which all define it differently. 21 MR. KEDEM: Sure. So, first with respect to 22 all the different State laws, even in the two cases 23 under the categorical approach where this Court has 24 looked to multi-jurisdictional surveys, it did not apply 25 Petitioner's methodology. In other words, it did not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 ask in Taylor whether second-degree burglary under

35

2 Missouri law would have been criminal under the penal

3 codes of 50 different States. And I think State surveys

4 can be relevant only insofar as you think that they will

5 tell you something about the words that Congress used.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: And this quest for the --

7 the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor seems to

8 me to be a -- a meaningless quest. There's no "there"

9 there. It's not like burglary where there's a common

10 law definition. You've got some core. This is a phrase

11 that doesn't have a common law counterpart. And if you

12 look at all these State statutes and throw in all the

13 Federal statutes that you can find that have some

14 relation to this, what you have is a -- a big array of

15 very disparate statutes.

16 So this seems to me like a classic example

17 of Congress saying, we have this category sexual abuse

18 of a minor, and we know that there's all this array of

19 State laws. And so you, Attorney General, define what

20 should be within this for immigration purposes.

21 MR. KEDEM: We agree with that, Justice

22 Alito. Before we turn to issues of Chevron and

23 deference in general, I'd like to just identify --

24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kedem, can I say that --

25 MR. KEDEM: Sure.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
36 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- I think you disagree with 2 two parts of that. Because the first thing you said to 3 me was that you agree that the first thing that has to 4 be done is to define a generic offense. 5 MR. KEDEM: That's correct. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: So Justice Alito was 7 suggesting that, in this case, we shouldn't do that at 8 all. So you disagree there. And then Justice Alito 9 said, in this case you just have to think like, what 10 does the BIA think about this? 11 MR. KEDEM: Correct. 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you said to me, even 13 without deference, you win. So -- so you're taking a 14 very different view than Justice Alito is. You're 15 saying that what the BIA interpretation was is the best 16 understanding of the generic offense. 17 MR. KEDEM: So maybe the best way to answer 18 that question is to describe what the government thinks 19 is the relationship between the two arguments that we 20 make in the brief. 21 The term "sexual abuse of a minor" would 22 naturally support the interpretation that we offer in 23 the first section of our brief to cover all sexual 24 activity directed at a minor under the age of 18 years 25 old. However, the board has chosen a more modest
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 interpretation based on a practical construction of the 2 word "abuse." And because the board exercises the 3 Attorney General's authority to interpret and give 4 meaning to the statute, because it chose a definition 5 that is both reasonable and consistent with the statute, 6 this Court should defer because that is what Congress 7 wanted. And so you are giving effect to what Congress 8 has intended when you defer to the board. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about an 10 application -11 MR. KEDEM: But because -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 13 application of the rule of lenity? 14 MR. KEDEM: So I think application of the 15 rule of lenity does coexist with Chevron in the 16 following sense: I think, first of all, before the 17 board, the board has recognized that lenity can come 18 into play, but it has conceived of it in the same 19 limited way that this Court has; namely, that you don't 20 apply lenity simply because the statute can be read in 21 more than one way. You apply it only when, after trying 22 everything else, you simply have to throw up your hands 23 because you cannot figure out what Congress wanted. 24 There is a grievous ambiguity that simply cannot be 25 resolved.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you necessarily 2 apply Chevron before you apply the rule of lenity? 3 MR. KEDEM: I think -- I think that you do, 4 but I think there's still work for lenity to do even 5 after applying Chevron. Certainly, if the board has 6 spoken to the precise question at issue, then I think it 7 would be hard for you to be left at the end of the day 8 after giving that deference where it's a grievous 9 ambiguity. But often agencies speak only to a related 10 question or fill only part of a statutory gap, in which 11 case after giving appropriate deference to that answer, 12 you would still possibly be left with a different aspect 13 of the problem that you simply cannot resolve, in which 14 case lenity would apply. 15 But we don't think it makes sense to apply 16 lenity at the first step of the -- at the first step of 17 Chevron, because at that step, the Court is asking, are 18 the words sufficiently clear that there's really only 19 one way to read them? And it doesn't make sense to 20 apply a tie-breaking canon that says you only come into 21 play at the end of the process after you simply cannot 22 figure out what the words mean at all. And certainly, 23 this Court has never applied lenity in that way -24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I can understand Chevron 25 in the context of an agency that has special expertise
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 in regulating the environment or the forest service or 2 fisheries or nuclear power. Why does the INS have any 3 expertise in determining the meaning of a criminal 4 statute? 5 MR. KEDEM: So, first of all, Justice 6 Kennedy, I think it's important to orient ourselves 7 around the fact that this is a civil statute that's 8 being applied in a civil context. But I do agree with 9 your point that it's not as if the agency can read a 10 dictionary or look at legislative history any better 11 than any -- any courts certainly. And that's true of 12 agencies generally. 13 But when the agencies give meaning to a 14 statute, they bring to bear practical wisdom and 15 experience in ways that are important. And, for 16 instance, in this case, the Board of Immigration 17 Appeals, first of all, decided that because there are so 18 many -- so much variation among the different State 19 offenses that are involved here, it made sense to apply 20 an incremental approach to engage in case-by-case 21 adjudication rather than trying to cover the waterfront. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why is INS in any 23 better position to make that determination than the 24 American Bar Association or the forest service? 25 MR. KEDEM: So I think that the board
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 exercises delegated authority from the Attorney General, 2 who is administering the scheme in an administrative 3 capacity. And I think to a certain extent talking about 4 Chevron deference, while accurate, is actually a little 5 bit misleading. Because often when we're talking about 6 Chevron, we're talking about the concept that when 7 Congress gives an agency the power to engage in 8 rulemaking or formal adjudication, we basically assume 9 that that power comes along with the ability to 10 interpret the statute. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: What he's saying -- I think 12 what the question is, is this: There are many 13 agencies -- Social Security -- that have statutes that 14 are incredibly detailed and have to do rather directly 15 with how this program is being administered. 16 MR. KEDEM: Sure. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: And they see some words 18 over here in Part 1 on page 3860. And they know, but we 19 wouldn't know, that if you interpret it one way rather 20 than another, it's going to be much harder to do the 21 thing as a practical matter that they have over there on 22 page 842. All right? They'll know that; we won't know. 23 MR. KEDEM: Sure. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: But you've just listed 25 things that we seem to be able to know just as well as
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 they.

41

2 MR. KEDEM: So, Justice Breyer, one thing to

3 keep in mind is that the aggravated felony definition is

4 a spine that runs throughout the INA and determines a

5 whole range of administrative consequences, not merely

6 whether a person is removable, but whether they're

7 eligible, for instance, for cancelation of removal --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.

9 MR. KEDEM: -- asylum, certain detention

10 consequences, voluntary departure, readmission.

11 And in this case we're dealing with a

12 delegation of interpretive authority that is not merely

13 implicit in the sort of general sense Chevron talks

14 about it, but an express provision 8 U.S.C. 1103(a),

15 which says that the Attorney General not only gets to

16 conduct removal proceedings, but gets to render

17 interpretations in those proceedings that are, quote,

18 "controlling." And this Court has relied in cases like

19 Aguirre-Aguirre and Negusie on that fact.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So was there

21 anything else? Because what I asked -- I wanted my

22 first question, which you probably don't remember now.

23 But -- but I wanted to know why don't just look at 1143,

24 that's the end of it; okay?

25 MR. KEDEM: Sure.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
42 1 JUSTICE BREYER: And you said one, because 2 there's no cross-reference, so I got that one. You said 3 two -4 MR. KEDEM: Two -5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it would be because if 6 you go read the thing, 1140 -- is it 1143 or whatever -7 2243 -8 MR. KEDEM: Uh-huh. 9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if I go read that, I'll 10 see that there are things that couldn't possibly apply. 11 That was your second. And I think you were going to 12 make a third. Was there a third? I want to know -13 MR. KEDEM: So if there was a third, it 14 might have been that a 16-year age of consent and 4-year 15 age differential would disqualify statutes from most 16 States. Certainly, all of the States that set a higher 17 age of consent, but a number of the other States as 18 well. 19 If I could return just briefly to basically 20 the questions I've gotten about whether this statute 21 seems to be a bit of an outlier and why not just rule 22 out this statute. I think there are a few really 23 serious problems with that. 24 The first is that it would leave very patchy 25 and meager coverage because most State statutes are not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
43 1 continuous. Meaning that they don't have one provision 2 for 13-year-old minors, a different one for 14-year-old 3 minors, and so on and so forth. They tend to clump them 4 into age ranges. And Arizona is a good example of this. 5 Arizona has one provision that covers minors' ages 15 6 and up; a different provision that covers minors 14 and 7 below. If this Court were to say that the 15 and up 8 provision is disqualified because it applies to 16 and 9 17-year-olds or because it has a 2-year age 10 differential, that would leave only the 14 and below 11 provision, which means that a 15-year-old minor would 12 get no coverage regardless of the age of the 13 perpetrator. And it's not alone. There are other State 14 statutes that are just like that; Virginia, North 15 Dakota. 16 Second of all, it's actually quite -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's a good 18 reason to look at to 2243. 19 MR. KEDEM: Well, 2243 would disqualify even 20 more because, again, it requires a 16-year-old age of 21 consent, a 4-year age differential, and it includes a 22 reasonable mistake of age defense that most States don't 23 have. 24 I think it's also actually quite difficult 25 to determine what is or isn't an outlier. First of all,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
44 1 because State statutes differ on a range of different 2 categories simultaneously. We've focused on four of 3 them; the age of the victim, the perpetrator, the age 4 differential, and the offense conduct. But, again, 5 there's a mens rea requirement that some States have and 6 other States don't. Some require an element of sexual 7 gratification that other States do not. 8 Moreover, it's difficult enough when you're 9 talking about current State statutes. You have to go to 10 all of the criminal -- go through all of the criminal 11 code of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, and so on and so 12 forth, and that's difficult because States don't label 13 these crimes the same way. But it's possible because 14 all States currently put those online. 15 But as Petitioner has conceded, we're 16 talking about State codes as they existed in 1996, which 17 means to do that, you really have to go to the statute 18 books. And Petitioner himself, for all his talk about 19 how this is the required methodology, hasn't even 20 performed that task for the statutes as they existed in 21 1996. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one question 23 about your interpretation. You interpret the word 24 "abusive" to mean illegal. 25 MR. KEDEM: That -- that is under the first
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
45 1 argument that the government makes. It's -- it's -- the 2 term is not just abusive, it's sexual abuse, which has 3 its own definition under the dictionary and its own 4 understood meaning. 5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and you -- but you 6 say that sexual abuse means illegal sexual contact. 7 MR. KEDEM: Illegal sexual conduct, usually, 8 and the word "minor" added to the statutory provision, 9 sort of reinforces that we're just talking about minors 10 here. 11 So, in addition to the problems that I've 12 just been discussing with this multi-jurisdictional 13 survey and looking for outliers, it would also pull the 14 Court into a number of very difficult line-drawing 15 problems. For instance, what's the right numerical 16 threshold? Is it 50 percent? Two-thirds? 17 Three-quarters? Something else? 18 You also have to figure out how to deal with 19 State populations. Seems somewhat anomalous to treat 20 Wyoming's statute exactly the same as California's, even 21 though California's statute applies to more than 50 22 times the population. 23 You also have to figure out how to deal with 24 defenses, the element of sexual gratification that some 25 States have and other things.

46 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Kedem, Mr. Fisher 2 said and I just want to make sure that this is right, 3 that you no longer rely on the statute that the BIA 4 relied on; is that correct? 5 MR. KEDEM: I think -- I think the BIA 6 itself relied on it only in a very general way. If you 7 read the decision below -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So the answer is no. 9 So what -- what do you rely on? What are 10 the sources that you rely on to generate this 11 definition? Because you're not relying on the Federal 12 statute. You're not relying on the most common State 13 statutes. You're not relying on the other Federal 14 statute that the BIA relied on. What are you relying on 15 to generate this definition? 16 MR. KEDEM: So we treat this as an ordinary 17 case of statutory interpretation. We rely -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm asking for ordinary -19 MR.

7 MR. KEDEM: No, that's not right. It

8 doesn't apply in this case because we're dealing with a

9 subset of those offenses just dealing with someone who's

10 a different age, but we would also think that it applies

11 to familial relationship offenses and I -- and I --

KEDEM: So we cite two of them in -- in 5 the -- in this -- in our brief. I don't have the 6 citations at -- at my fingertips. There are provisions 7 dealing with different things, but they both said 8 the word "minor" -9 JUSTICE KAGAN: One -- one's -- one deals 10 with the rights of child witnesses. The other is a rule 11 for calculating the duration of unlawful presence. 12 MR. KEDEM: That's right. 13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Are those the two? 14 MR. KEDEM: Those are two. 15 JUSTICE KAGAN: So those two, which really 16 have nothing to do with the generic meaning of sexual 17 abuse of a minor. 18 MR. KEDEM: That's correct. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: A single dictionary -- a 20 single dictionary definition, and some legislative 21 history that even you indicate is sparse. 22 MR.

49 1 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it your understanding 2 anything other than -- if a stranger does anything to a 3 minor other than commit a rape, then that would not be 4 sexual abuse of a minor because the person wouldn't be a 5 relative or an acquaintance? 6 MR. KEDEM: I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not sure I 7 understand the question. 8 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought your definition 9 was it had to be a relative -- parent, relative, or 10 acquaintance; is that right? 11 MR. KEDEM: I think those are probably what 12 it targets. I'm -- I'm not sure that -- I would say 13 that if somebody isn't an acquaintance, it -- it doesn't 14 count. 15 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- of course. If 16 somebody meets someone at a bar and doesn't even know 17 them and -- and gets the person drunk and they go home 18 and they have sex, all right, that would sound much more 19 like sexual abuse of a minor than a -- a senior in 20 college dating and living with a -- a sophomore. Okay? 21 MR. KEDEM: So I -- I -22 JUSTICE BREYER: That's my question. 23 MR. KEDEM: So I -- I think it would apply 24 in that case being an acquaintance. 25 JUSTICE BREYER: It would, but there's no

2 MR. KEDEM: But if --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Unless everyone is.

4 MR. KEDEM: If -- if I could turn to the

5 question of deference in this case. I think Petitioner

6 often raises separation of powers concerns but doesn't

7 actually explain why those come into play in this

8 instance. And I think -- let me give you the sort of

9 doctrinal response that the government has and then the

10 sort of more general response.

11 The narrow doctrinal response is that for

12 more than 100 years, this Court has upheld the statutory

13 schemes that impose criminal consequences on decisions

14 that are made by administrative agencies. Now, it may

15 be that there are concerns under that about notice or

16 concerns about delegation concerns, but Petitioner

17 himself obviously has no notice problems here given that

18 we're talking about a core administration in the civil

19 scheme, and that any criminal conduct that he might

20 engage in in the future, he would have very clear notice

21 that his prior State offense was an aggravated felony.

22 Perhaps there would be someone in some

23 hypothetical case who engaged in the offense conduct

24 before the board rendered its authoritative

25 interpretation, and maybe they would have an as-applied

Alderson Reporting Company

51 1 due process challenge, but apart from that, we're not 2 aware of notice concerns ever coming into play. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Don't you have the 4 problem that somebody in another State that did the same 5 thing that this defendant was -- this person was 6 convicted of would be no crime in another State? 7 MR. KEDEM: Sure. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -9 MR. KEDEM: That -- that's true whenever you 10 have the categorical approach. So, for instance, in 11 Kawashima, this Court dealt with a provision covering 12 offenses involving fraud or deceit. It may be that 13 there are certain of those offenses that apply to -- in 14 one State that don't apply in another State, and that's 15 just a feature of the categorical approach. 16 I also think there are a number of features 17 of this case that distinguish it from maybe some of the 18 more problematic criminal applications that the Court 19 might have in mind. 20 First of all, we're talking about a core INA 21 provision. So if you're talking about which is the tail 22 and which is the dog, in this case, the civil 23 application is very much the dog. It is applied civilly 24 thousands of times a year. The number of applications 25 in the criminal context is vanishingly small.

52 1 Second of all -- second of all, we're 2 talking here about an explicit delegation of 3 interpretive authority, which is actually quite rare. 4 It is rare that Congress says that an agency explicitly 5 gets to render controlling interpretations of the 6 statute. 7 Furthermore, we're talking about only 8 instances of further culpable conduct. It is not a 9 violation of the board's decision alone that gets you 10 into criminal trouble. You have to engage in further 11 conduct, and that conduct has its own culpability. 12 And, finally, all of the potential criminal 13 consequences that we're talking about, these three 14 statutes, are ones that come for people who are trying 15 to violate and frustrate the civil scheme. 16 So Section 1253 talks about people who are 17 ordered to be removed but refuse to comply. 18 Section 1326 talks about people who have 19 been removed but then try illegally to reenter the 20 country. 21 And 1327 applies to people who try and 22 illegally assist others who are entering the country. 23 And so they are all directed at frustration 24 of the core civil scheme. So that would be another way 25 to distinguish this case from other, more problematic

1 instances.

53

2 Finally, I think part of what the Court is

3 reacting to, again, is the idea that drawing a line is

4 very difficult, and it's something that will be a little

5 bit arbitrary no matter what. I think that's a strong

6 reason to defer to the board, because administrative

7 agencies are actually quite good at drawing these sorts

8 of lines. And conversely, they're sort of problematic

9 for courts to do it.

10 And there's a layer of political

11 accountability that comes along when an agency does it,

12 because if the agency puts the -- the line in the wrong

13 place, if they make it too strenuous or too lenient,

14 then they can be held accountable for that.

15 If the Court has no further questions.

18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20 MR. FISHER: Thank you. I'd like to cover

21 seven -- I'm sorry -- four topics.

22 (Laughter.)

23 MR. FISHER: Four topics.

24 First, as to multi-jurisdictional surveys,

25 the cases the government talks about where the Court has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
54 1 not conducted those kinds of surveys are cases where the 2 Court did not have to define a generic offense. The two 3 cases that the Court has had to do that are Taylor and 4 in Duenas-Alvarez. And in both cases, they looked to -5 this Court looked to multi-jurisdictional surveys. 6 And it's especially surprising to see the 7 government here criticizing multi-jurisdictional surveys 8 because that's precisely the approach the government 9 asked this Court to adopt in Duenas-Alvarez. And the 10 Court did, unanimously. 11 If I -- if I could just read one sentence of 12 that opinion, because it's not just a 13 multi-jurisdictional analysis, but it's conducting it in 14 the precise manner we asked the Court to conduct it 15 here. 16 The Court says at page 191, "To succeed, 17 Deunas-Alvarez must show something special about 18 California's version of the statute" -- that was a theft 19 statute -- "that criminalizes conduct that other States 20 would not consider illegal." 21 That's the question the Court posed at the 22 government's behest and answered in Duenas-Alvarez, and 23 that's the question we ask the Court to ask and answer 24 here today. And for good reason. 25 You don't just -- you need to have something
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
55 1 that's replicable and something that's objective when 2 you confront a provision that doesn't have an express 3 definition. 4 Imagine the person in his lawyer's office 5 saying, should I plead guilty to this crime or the other 6 crime? Which one is going to render me deportable? You 7 can't imagine a defendant's lawyer conducting his 8 Padilla duties, and having to imagine what the BIA might 9 come up with when it surveys family planning journals 10 from 20 years ago and imagines the kinds of things the 11 Solicitor General was describing. And so there are good 12 instrumental reasons for using multi-jurisdictional 13 surveys. 14 Finally, if you did end up in a situation 15 the Solicitor General would like you to believe exists 16 here, but we think doesn't, but if there were a 17 situation where you just had a scatter plot among the 18 States, and it were too difficult to find any common 19 core, what you would do in that situation is what the 20 Ninth Circuit, in a leading opinion by Judge Kozinski 21 did in a case called Anderson, which is revert back to 22 the Federal statute, defining that Federal offense, the 23 crime itself, where Congress acted like a criminal law 24 maker and said, here's what we want to cover. 25 Second, as to the topic of ruling out some
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
56 1 State statutes, depending on what rule the Court would 2 adopt here. We say, for the reasons in Footnote 1 of 3 our reply brief, that you actually don't have a serious 4 problem with overinclusiveness, because, yes, there are 5 some particular State laws that are going to get 6 rendered not aggravated felonies. All of those States 7 have laws dealing with 16 year olds, or -- or 15 year 8 old ages of consent, or slightly younger. So you're 9 still going to get the people that Congress most wanted 10 the law to apply to. 11 And just take an example like Georgia. It 12 has a law making it a crime for anyone to have sex with 13 somebody who's under 16, with no age differential at 14 all. Even if you wanted to pick up the age differential 15 in Section 2243, it still wouldn't be a problem in that 16 state because Georgia has a second law making it a 17 felony as opposed to a misdemeanor when there's a 18 four-year age differential. So you find this time and 19 again in the State laws that you don't have a serious 20 problem with consequences. 21 Next, the Solicitor General talked about 22 Section 2243 if you were to adopt that definition, in 23 leaving out things like familial abuse or abuse of 24 authority and the like. 25 Now we agree, or at least our position is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
57 1 that you don't have to answer that question. I think, 2 in all candor, that is the hard case. It's the one that 3 falls outside of Section 2243, and the reason why you 4 don't necessarily have to choose in this case. 5 But there would be a good reason to choose 6 Section 2243, is because the structure of the BIA -- I'm 7 sorry -- the structure of the INA has other provisions 8 that make other things deportable offenses, most notably 9 child abuse or crimes against moral turpitude. So the 10 familial abuse, like my friend here is describing, would 11 be picked up in a separate subsection of the INA. So 12 you don't have to worry about that consequence either. 13 And then finally, as to statutory 14 construction and the rule of lenity. First, I'd say you 15 don't have to reach that difficult question about how 16 Chevron and the rule of lenity interact when it comes to 17 hybrid statutes. I think, if I understood the other 18 side's argument, all it's down to is a Black's Law 19 Dictionary citation, primarily. And -- and even that 20 has its problems for the reason Justice Alito pointed 21 out, when it deals with people who are not 22 acquaintances. 23 And secondly, because even that provision 24 itself uses the word "illegal." And to make the word 25 "illegal" have meaning, as Justice Kagan points out you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
58 1 need to do, you turn to a different page in Black's Law 2 Dictionary to find out when sex is illegal based on age, 3 and it tells you that 16 is the age of consent. So even 4 Black's Law Dictionary leads to where we would have the 5 Court go, so the BIA's interpretation cannot possibly be 6 reasonable. 7 But if you did want to address or need to 8 address the question of how Chevron and the rule of 9 lenity interact, at the end of the day, the Solicitor 10 General has to be arguing one of two things to this 11 Court. 12 Either their position has to be that 13 statutes can be chameleons and mean one thing on 14 criminal side and a different thing in the civil side -15 and that would be in the teeth of many of this Court's 16 cases -- or they have to be arguing that the BIA has the 17 power to -- to control -- I'm sorry -- to control what a 18 statute means, not just in civil settings, but in 19 criminal settings. And that would be a dramatic 20 departure from anything the Court has ever held, at 21 least where Congress hasn't delegated that power 22 expressly to the agency to control, not only civil 23 applications, but also the scope of criminal law. 24 If there's a problem with that, if you're 25 troubled by that consequence, remember, Congress can
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
59 1 always draft two separate statutes. At the end of the 2 day, it's Congress's choice whether to have a statute 3 apply in both settings. And I think it's reasonable to 4 conclude that if Congress has a statute applying in both 5 settings, it wants it, first of all, to mean the same 6 thing, and second of all, it doesn't intend the agency 7 to have power over that particular provision. 8 If the Court has any questions about our 9 approach or about what I've said, I'm happy to answer 10 them, otherwise I'll submit the case. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 12 Case is submitted. 13 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the 14 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
