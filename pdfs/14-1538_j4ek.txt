3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:15 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 this morning in Case 14-1538, Life Technologies 5 Corporation v. Promega Corporation. 6 Mr. Phillips. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 I think because this is largely an 12 international trade case, it's probably useful to put 13 this case in context and to compare it to the facts that 14 gave rise to the passage of Section 271(f) that's at 15 issue in this case. You'll recall that in the Deepsouth 16 case, that was a case involving a shrimp deveiner in 17 which all of the activities took place within the United 18 States, except for the final act that took less than an 19 hour to assemble in a foreign country. In that case, 20 this Court held even that was not within the meaning of 21 the -- of the patent statute as it existed then, and 22 Congress then acted to fill that particular loophole. 23 The facts of this case seem to me to be the 24 polar opposite of that. With -- Life Tech has -- Life 25 Technologies operates an -- an enormous plant in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 England, in the United Kingdom. It spends tens of

4

2 million dollars on that plant. Four out of the five

3 components that go into the creation of the kits that

4 are at issue in this case are sourced outside of the

5 United States; one inside. I'll come back to that in a

6 minute. And as relevant to this litigation, all of the

7 kit -- kits are sold outside of the United States.

8 So the only contact that any of this has

9 with the United States is the fact that a single,

10 commodity product is shipped to England as part of the

11 process for the fabrication of these particular kits.

12 Now, that commodity product is called a Taq

13 polymerase, which I will readily concede that when I

14 think about what you buy off-the-shelf, I don't go to

15 Costco to buy Taq polymerase, but I'm told, and I think

16 it's absolutely undisputed in the record, that this is a

17 commodity. This is at the essence of what the Congress

18 enacted in (f)(2), which is a staple article or

19 commodity of commerce suitable for many non-infringing

20 uses. And, indeed, if you get online and put in "Taq

21 polymerase," you can find literally dozens and dozens of

22 ways to purchase it online at this time. And that was

23 true as much in 2006. It may have been a significant

24 product in 1989, but clearly by 2006, it was a

25 commodity.

5 1 And so the question is, is whether or not, 2 simply by using a single, staple article, Congress 3 intended through 271 to -- to declare that this is -4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell us -5 MR. PHILLIPS: -- a violation. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- is this product 7 available outside the U.S.? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Taq polymerase? 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 10 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. Yes. It's -11 it's readily available throughout the world through -12 there are a variety of manufacturers who wish to make -13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's no patent on 14 that particular component? 15 MR. PHILLIPS: No, none that -- none that 16 exists any longer, no. As I said, it's a commodity 17 product. The -18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know why that 19 particular component was exported from the United 20 States? You -- you said all the others -21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- were made in England. 23 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, and the key to this is 24 you want -- you want to get the best quality product 25 at -- presumably, at the lowest possible price. And --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
6 1 and most of these were purchased -- most of the Taq was 2 purchased from the Roche company, and I -- and I suspect 3 they just had a better supply arrangement. 4 I mean, that's -- that's the key to this 5 case in a lot of ways, is what you're looking for is, 6 what are the best supply arrangements that you can make 7 on a global basis? Can you get them in the United 8 States? Can you get them outside the United States? 9 And what it seems to me clear that Congress could never 10 have intended was to in some way disadvantage U.S. 11 manufacturers who are providing a particular staple. 12 Indeed, I would read 271(f)(2) as saying 13 categorically that the one thing Congress did not want 14 to do is to interfere with the ability to -- of a 15 manufacturer to provide a staple article as part of 16 the -- as part of an activity outside of the United 17 States. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If all of this had 19 happened in the United States, would there have been a 20 patent infringement suit that would be -- have merit? 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, if everything had 22 take -- taken place inside the United States, there 23 would have been. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the U.K. laws, are 25 patents generally enforced for items that are patentable
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 in the U.K.?

7

2 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Yes, absolutely.

3 And -- and -- and, indeed, in this case, Promega had --

4 I think Promega -- at least somebody had a patent in the

5 U.K., but that patent had expired, which is, candidly,

6 not surprisingly, why the activity was taken.

7 And that -- and that is ultimately, Justice

8 Kennedy, the answer to these issues. If a patentholder

9 in the United States is upset by the use of a particular

10 invention outside the United States, the solution is to

11 go outside of the United States and seek packet -- pack

12 -- patent protection in that particular country.

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume, though, that

14 there might be other countries that are not so vigorous

15 in their enforcements as the U.K.

16 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I suspect that there

17 may be, although there -- you know, this isn't broadly

18 regulated by -- by treaties. And the -- and to me, the

19 key is, you know, right -- you know, the United States

20 has agreed that each country should regulate its own

21 patent rights. I mean, we're bought into that deal

22 in -- in the Paris Convention in the 19th century,

23 and -- and consistently have accepted that. And

24 that's -- and the whole theory of this, is to ensure the

25 free flow of commerce across borders on a regular basis,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 at least when we're talking about staple articles of

8

2 commerce.

3 You know, if -- if -- you know, where the

4 Federal Circuit clearly got this wrong is in saying that

5 you could interpret (f)(1), which talks about a -- a

6 substantial portion of the commodities, and say that a

7 single commodity can be a substantial portion, when

8 (f)(2) says that in order for a single commodity to

9 constitute a -- to give rise to a potential claim of a

10 violation, what it has to be is especially made or

11 especially adapted for use in the particular invention.

12 JUSTICE ALITO: Does "substantial portion"

13 mean a majority?

14 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I think it means

15 substantially more than a majority. I -- I would -- I

16 would say that it has to be approximating or very close

17 or tantamount to all.

18 JUSTICE ALITO: So here, there were five

19 components?

20 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Your Honor.

21 JUSTICE ALITO: And -- and they would have

22 to be -- all -- all five would have to be made in the

23 United States? Or --

24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I would -- at

25 minimum --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
9 1 JUSTICE ALITO: -- four would be enough? 2 MR. PHILLIPS: I would have thought at least 3 four would have to be. But I -- I -- you know, in many 4 instances, my guess is the right answer may well be 5 five. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Where -- where do you get 7 that from? What's the principle there? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Because all Congress wanted 9 to do was to close a loophole where you're essentially 10 doing nothing but violating U.S. patent law and avoiding 11 it by simply offloading it at the last second. In a lot 12 of instances, I don't think that's true when you're only 13 talking about a majority of -- of the -- the items. 14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how do we know that 15 that's all Congress wanted to do? I mean, that might 16 have been the -- the -- the scenario in Deepsouth, but 17 Congress used language that could refer to much more 18 than that, that could refer to a majority, that even 19 could refer to a substantial minority. 20 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah. I -- I -- I think 21 there is no way to -- to -- first of all, the -- the 22 rule against extra -- the rule -- the presumption 23 against extraterritoriality would drive you in the 24 opposite direction. Even if you could reasonably read 25 the language either way, you would -- you would drive it
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 toward recognizing that the company that the substantial 2 portion keeps is the word "all," and it's talking about 3 components. 4 And so those are, to my mind, very much 5 quantitative and driven in the direction of all. I -6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so you agree that 7 "substantial portion" is an ambiguous term? 8 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I -9 I agree. It could be interpreted in either of two ways, 10 which is why I think the principle against 11 extraterritoriality drives you in the direction of 12 saying Congress meant only to allow U.S. patents to 13 operate outside the United States in very narrow 14 circumstances. And if Congress chooses to -- to create 15 the kinds of international problems that will 16 undoubtedly arise by an overbroad interpretation of 17 271(f), which is what the Federal Circuit has adopted, 18 leave it to Congress to go back and fix that, because 19 those are -- those are issues of international relations 20 that, it seems to me, Congress is in a much better 21 position than the courts -22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But those are -23 MR. PHILLIPS: -- to sort out. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just two -- two 25 components, the polymerase and then a -- a patent --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 the -- a second part of a patent that we'll envision. 2 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Clearly in that 3 situation, there's -- there's no liability, because 4 it -- you know, because only one of those components -5 you know, either one of two things happen. Either both 6 of them are being put together or -- or only one of them 7 is, and 271(f)(1) -8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems -- it seems to me 9 that even if we -- we agree with you that quantitative 10 is -- is the proper measure, you still have qualitative 11 coming in to balance your judgment, as in the case of 12 one out of two -13 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- not in one out of 14 two. One out of two, seems to me, is dictated by 15 271(f)(2) that says that if it's only one, and then it 16 has to be either especially -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no -18 MR. PHILLIPS: -- adapted or especially -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm just talking 20 about (f)(1). 21 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you 22 were talking about one out of two components. I 23 apologize. 24 No, when you get to one -- you know, there's 25 no question at some point, as you're approaching all,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 but not all, that you're going to have to make some

12

2 kinds of judgments, but it seems to me it's absolutely

3 critical that the Court maintain a very significant

4 numerical component to it. Otherwise, what you do is

5 allow the -- the extraterritorial principle not to have

6 the full sway that it should be entitled to.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I agree

8 with your understanding of the extraterritorial

9 principle. I don't -- I mean, do you really take that

10 down into the minutiae of every little clause? It seems

11 to me it's once the law applies, then you apply normal

12 principles of statutory interpretation. I think we have

13 cases about that in other -- in other areas, which is

14 sort of what is the reach, I think, may be the

15 presumption against infringements in sovereign immunity,

16 is -- a case I can't recall right away that said, well,

17 once you get over it, you know, it's over, and then you

18 apply normal principles.

19 And it -- I'm not sure at every turn --

20 okay, and we know that this is a statute that obviously

21 applies overseas.

22 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, Mr. Chief Justice,

23 that -- that's exactly the opposite of what the Court

24 said in Microsoft. In Microsoft, the Court said that

25 the issue is not simply, is this extraterritorial,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 because there's no question that 271(f) operates

13

2 extraterritorially. The question is the sweep of

3 271(f). And -- and this Court said that it was going to

4 interpret the word "component" very narrowly in that

5 context, candidly, in the same way that the -- that this

6 Court also interpreted it in the Deepsouth case, meaning

7 --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

9 MR. PHILLIPS: -- very narrowly. And we're

10 asking you to do the same thing, which is to say, adopt

11 a narrow construction of the "substantial component"

12 language so that it drives much closer to the word "all"

13 and recognizes that this is meant as a --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: Your real argument is just

15 that -- isn't it -- that you interpret it differently

16 than you do, and we cause a lot of problems in other

17 countries.

18 I mean, they -- they can't tell whether,

19 when they get one component, their lawyer is going to

20 have to know not only British law, it's going to have to

21 know American law.

22 MR. PHILLIPS: That's exactly --

23 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and that's a very

24 practical argument.

25 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 JUSTICE BREYER: And it -- really, we don't 2 need -- well, you, it's up to you what you want to use. 3 But I don't -- you -- the problem is, if that's the 4 point, why do you need this sort of grand thing about -5 about a -- a presumption against extraterritoriality? 6 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah -7 JUSTICE BREYER: It's up to you what you 8 want to use, but -9 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, yeah, yeah -- well, 10 look, I'm -- I'm perfectly comfortable with, really, 11 any -- any policy argument you feel comfortable with. 12 That one -13 (Laughter.) 14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -15 MR. PHILLIPS: -- is certainly one that 16 we -- we embraced. 17 I mean, the other -- the other policy 18 argument that seems to me equally strong in this context 19 is the -- is the mischief that the Federal Circuit's 20 Rule provides for trolls, because now, not only do you 21 have all of the trolls in the world looking for all of 22 the products in the world, but now they're going to go 23 through the entire supply chain of every punitive 24 infringer and go after each provider of a single staple 25 article of commerce as part of this exercise --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
15 1 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think -2 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and it seems to me that 3 cannot be possibly what Congress intended. 4 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's clear that 5 the -- that the -- the qualitative interpretation has a 6 greater extraterritorial effect than the quantitative 7 interpretation? 8 What if you have a situation where -- let's 9 say there are ten components, and nine of them are -10 are made overseas, but those are very routine things; 11 those are like the product that was made in the United 12 States here. You can buy them off the shelf. 13 But there's one that's very unique. Now, 14 it's not made specifically for this device, but it's 15 very -- it's -- it's very unique, and that's -- and 16 that's made in the United States. 17 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah. Well, you know -- from 18 my -- it -- the only device coming from the United 19 States is a single device -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Right. 21 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and it's not -- and it 22 doesn't satisfy "especially made or especially adapted." 23 It seems to me that (f)(2) tells you specifically, 24 that's not within the meaning of the statute. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm not sure if that's
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 --

16

2 MR. PHILLIPS: And if Congress wants to fix

3 it, it can fix that.

4 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure if that's true,

5 Mr. Phillips. I mean, you're reading (f)(2) as having a

6 negative implication, that this is the only time when

7 one component can create liability, is when it's

8 especially made or especially adapted. But these might

9 be just independent clauses.

10 In other words, (f)(2) talks about a

11 component that's especially made, whether or not it's a

12 substantial portion of the product. And then (f)(1)

13 comes in and says -- independently creates a rule for a

14 component or components that are a substantial portion

15 of the product.

16 So I'm not sure why we have to read (f)(2)

17 as creating this negative implication as to any product,

18 any single product, as opposed to just saying (f)(2) is

19 about specially made stuff, and it has nothing to do

20 with (f)(1), which is not about specially made stuff,

21 and provides a different test about substantial --

22 substantiality.

23 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I mean, in -- in the

24 first instance, I don't -- I mean, I don't think that's

25 the more natural way to read the two together. But then

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 I would go back, and -- and without trying to offend

17

2 Justice Breyer, go to the principle against

3 extraterritoriality, and say -- say to you that if there

4 were two different ways that are equally plausible to

5 interpret this language, you should interpret the

6 language to be more narrowly applicable, and therefore

7 less likely to interfere with extra -- with

8 extraterritorial -- extraterritorial application of

9 patent law.

10 And so that's the reason. It -- I'm not

11 saying that you would have, in the abstract, been

12 compelled to a particular conclusion, but in a situation

13 where Congress has used the language talking about all

14 or a major -- or a -- or a substantial portion where all

15 is all but -- you know, it's very close to that, talks

16 about components of the invention, not of the invention

17 itself, the Federal Circuit twice in its opinion just

18 dropped out "of the components of the invention," where

19 it's clear that that's designed to be a --

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what are --

21 MR. PHILLIPS: -- quantitative analysis.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the -- what are

23 the components of the invention? How do we know what

24 the -- the components of the invention?

25 MR. PHILLIPS: This Court in Microsoft said

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 that the components of the invention are the elements in 2 the claim, and so you look at the claim and you 3 interpret the claim and you -- and you devise from that. 4 Now, that -- that -- that's claim -- that's 5 claim construction. And that's, you know, not always 6 the easiest thing in the world to do, and it requires 7 review of the claims, review of the specification and 8 the -- and the history. But in this particular case, 9 it's really easy. 10 The claims say very categorically what each 11 of the five components are, is, and -- and so that one 12 is easy. 13 If there are no further questions, Your 14 Honors, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 16 Mr. Tripp. 17 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D. TRIPP 18 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 19 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 20 MR. TRIPP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 We are asking the Court to do two things 23 here today. 24 First, we are asking the Court to hold that 25 the supply of a single commodity component is never
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 enough. We think that's clearly right when you look at 2 (f)(1) and (f)(2) together, especially in light of 3 extraterritoriality concerns. 4 Second, we are asking the Court to hold that 5 (f)(1) reaches the supply of all or a large portion of 6 the components of the invention, not any important 7 portion of the invention. And the way we had put it is 8 that it reaches the supply of all or something 9 tantamount to all of the components. 10 And our principal practical concerns here 11 stem from the breadth of the Federal Circuit's ruling, 12 and it's broad because they are asking a loaded question 13 that's looking only at part of the picture. 14 If you look only at the supplied portion of 15 the components and you ask whether they are important or 16 essential to the operation or novelty of the invention, 17 the answer is always going to be yes. In most 18 inventions, if you take away any component, it isn't 19 going to work and it's not going to be patentable. So 20 we think you just can't come at it that way. 21 And then the second piece is that the 22 Federal Circuit isn't looking at all the components that 23 were not supplied, and so they are not asking the 24 comparative question of whether the person has done 25 anything similar to supplying all of the components.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
20 1 And we think that's just a critical piece here. This is 2 an anti-circumvention provision. It was enacted to 3 shore up the basic territorial restriction against 4 actually making a patented invention in the United 5 States and then shipping it abroad, and we think it 6 needs to be interpreted with that purpose in mind. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep saying 8 "substantially all." Mr. Phillips argued that 9 "substantially all" has to mean just that: Almost all. 10 You, instead, in your brief, want us to keep 11 that vaguer, but I'm assuming that there is a minimum 12 that wouldn't constitute an infringement. 13 MR. TRIPP: Well, I think -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 20 percent? 30 percent? 15 40? How -- how -16 MR. TRIPP: Well, so I think the -- the -17 the one bright line that we -- that we are drawing here 18 is -- on the face of the statute is that one is never 19 enough. We think that's clear when you look at (f)(1) 20 and (f)(2) together the way this Court read them in 21 Microsoft the first time. 22 Beyond that, the numbers are very important 23 under our test, but they are not the whole ball game. 24 We're -- we say this on page 26 of our brief. You could 25 also -- you would look not only at the numbers of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 components that were supplied and not supplied, but you 2 would also look at the relative time, money, and effort 3 that you would need to obtain the remaining components. 4 So if I could give -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Time -- time, money, 6 and effort, but not significance of the component? 7 MR. TRIPP: I think -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 9 the significance of the component would be the most 10 important consideration. If -11 MR. TRIPP: I think -- and so the -12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's the -- if 13 it's whatever you think is not quite enough, 70 percent, 14 but 70 percent of the components -- I mean, that's 15 really the core of what makes it work. I don't know why 16 you wouldn't look at that differently than if it's 70 17 percent, but the 70 percent are, you know, fairly 18 insignificant. 19 MR. TRIPP: Well, I -- I -- our principal 20 concern or -- as I was saying, is that if you just ask 21 the question of whether it's significant in the sense of 22 is it essential or important to the novelty of the 23 invention, I think that's just a black hole that's not 24 going to get you anywhere. And we think our approach 25 works better.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
22 1 And if I could just give you two examples of 2 how this would work using this particular invention? 3 So, if some -- if -- if the record here showed that 4 manufacturing the first component, the primer mix was, 5 you know, an incredibly difficult, time-consuming, hard, 6 challenging process, the bulk of the work here, but that 7 you could get the -- the reaction buffer very quickly in 8 a heartbeat, you know, it's like a dime a dozen, you 9 drop it into the kits and it works. 10 In that circumstance, if somebody supplied 11 all the components except the reaction buffer, we think 12 they would clearly be liable because they would have 13 done something that is really tantamount to supplying 14 all of the components. You could get that last one so 15 easily, but if supply -- if somebody supplied all the 16 components -17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To the expert testimony 18 here that out of the five, three were significant, so 19 let's assume they supplied the three significant 20 components and not the two less insignificant. What -21 what would your answer be then? 22 MR. TRIPP: I think that would be a much 23 closer case to supplying something that is tantamount to 24 supplying all of them under our test. I think the -25 the record here isn't -- isn't fully set out in terms of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 what it is that -- that -- that makes them main or

23

2 major.

3 What we are trying to get at -- and -- and

4 the key point to us, whether exactly how you articulate

5 this test I think doesn't matter all that much to us,

6 but what we really do care about is the idea that this

7 needs to be a comparative inquiry looking at how much

8 work there is left to be done to obtain the rest of the

9 components so that --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think once you --

11 once you're into your fairly complicated test, I mean, I

12 think it's -- you're off to the races. I mean, what

13 factors do you look at, all of that, when it -- it seems

14 to me the -- the clear argument is whether you want to

15 call it the plain text or not, but it's just focusing on

16 a numerical. It's -- it's -- it's a substantial portion

17 of the components, and now you're saying, well, it kind

18 of depends on what components we are talking about. You

19 know, how much time it takes to make them. Effort, I

20 don't quite understand what effort means in that area.

21 In -- in other words, you're -- you're --

22 you're compromising the principle in a way that really

23 undermines the force of the principle.

24 MR. TRIPP: No, I -- I -- I think that what

25 we are saying is that the -- the statute carries the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
24 1 quantitative meeting in the sense that it needs to be a 2 large portion, but this is an anti-circumvention 3 provision and then trying to figure out what it needs 4 for it to be a large portion, the numbers are a whole 5 lot of the picture. 6 I -- I don't want to -- I don't want to 7 diminish that, but as we said on page 26, we think they 8 are not the entire ball game, and a court look at -9 could look at some qualitative factors, but that it 10 would not look at the question of whether what's left on 11 the table is essential or in -- or to the novelty, 12 because the answer to that is always going to be yes. 13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know enough 14 patent law to have the answer to this. When a -- a 15 claim is made, what -- how is the determination made of 16 what the elements are? Do the elements' determinations 17 sort out the common from the uncommon in a patent claim? 18 MR. TRIPP: Not as I understand it, no. It 19 would just be -- it would just be sorting out what the 20 elements are, and -- and the way we approach the 21 components of the invention, this is on page 27 of our 22 brief, is we think, as in Microsoft, that they -23 they -- they are -- they need to be capable of 24 combination, and they are derived from the elements of 25 the claim.

25 1 So we think in -- in most cases it actually 2 won't be that difficult. And also, as it -- you know, 3 as I was saying, I -- I think under our approach, it 4 also, frankly, wouldn't matter that way. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: But why do we have to go 6 into the details here? I mean, it did strike me as an 7 instance where maybe the less said by us the better. I 8 mean, would you be happy if we say it means what it 9 says? 10 "All or substantially all" means a whole 11 lot. Or what you said, tantamount to all. So if you 12 get into that circumstance or you get into the "to" 13 circumstance, which is there is a special ingredient 14 here that has the special qualities, Mr. Manufacturer, 15 don't get close to that. 16 MR. TRIPP: I -- I think -17 JUSTICE BREYER: All these lawyers that will 18 be there telling them, don't get close to that, and the 19 thing will work over time. If we set a detailed test 20 down, then all those lawyers will be trying to figure 21 out how, in fact, they actually do the thing without 22 quite infringing the detail test. 23 MR. TRIPP: Yeah, I -- I -- I think that -24 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what worries me. 25 MR. TRIPP: I -- I think if you said that
Alderson Reporting Company

26 1 one was never enough and it needs to be a whole lot, we 2 would be quite happy. All that we're -3 JUSTICE BREYER: End of the case. It says 4 one means a lot, we need a whole lot, tantamount to the 5 whole lot, and good-bye. 6 MR. TRIPP: Yeah, we -- we -- we would be 7 perfectly happy with that. 8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. TRIPP: All -- all that I'm trying to do 10 is try and give you our sort of best gloss on 11 interpreting -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did you -- why 13 did you add the qualification to put in qualitative 14 considerations in addition to quantitative? 15 MR. TRIPP: Well, as I was trying to get at 16 with the -- the illustrations using this particular 17 invention, like you could get to a different answer even 18 when you have the same number of components. So if 19 somebody supplied everything but the reaction buffer, 20 this one you would get cheaper and easily, we think you 21 would be liable. 22 But if they did everything except the primer 23 mix, and that's really just an enormous amount of -24 of -- of what needs to happen here, then we think they 25 wouldn't have done something that's tantamount to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 supplying all the components. And they wouldn't be

27

2 liable because there would be so much left to be done.

3 But I think, frankly --

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's your

5 answer in this invention, but every other invention is

6 going to have a different mix of the time, the effort,

7 the, you know, qualitative aspect, and it -- again, it

8 does seem to be that once you get beyond looking at

9 purely quantitatively in terms of the components, I

10 don't think you've made much progress in clearing up

11 the -- the litigation costs and the confusion.

12 And I'm also not sure how it fits in with

13 the presumption against extraterritoriality, or at least

14 the clear application of that.

15 MR. TRIPP: Well, I -- I -- I think the main

16 thing that we are getting at is that -- and -- and --

17 and again, as I was saying, I -- I don't think we have a

18 strong -- strong position on how exactly you -- you

19 articulate the test. Our concern is that it needs to be

20 pinned to an anti-circumvention provision, and the

21 question is, are you doing something that is pretty

22 close to supplying all the components? How exactly are

23 you --

24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because there's a reason why

25 it's that almost all.

28 1 I mean, if I said to you, Mr. Tripp, a 2 substantial portion of my former clerks have gone into 3 government work, how many would I mean? 4 MR. TRIPP: Well, I -- I think with any of 5 these things, the interpretation of substantial depends 6 entirely on its context and its purpose, and -- and -7 and so this term is used in just, like, a countless 8 array of ways in the law. 9 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you're not pinning this 10 on the -- on the language here, the substantial portion 11 means almost all? 12 MR. TRIPP: Well, no -13 JUSTICE KAGAN: You are finding it from 14 someplace else? And where are you finding it from? 15 MR. TRIPP: So we're trying to give a gloss 16 on substantiality in light of the context and purpose of 17 this statue as -- as we understand all of 271(f) is 18 designed to shore up the basic restrictioning and is 19 actually making a patented invention in the United 20 States and then shipping it abroad. Both of the 21 provisions get at that. We think (f)(1) is situations 22 that resemble the Deepsouth paradigm you're -23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But then you take Justice 24 Alito's hypothetical, which is a product where there's a 25 single product that is accounting for 90 percent of the

1 time and effort, and whatever the third thing you

29

2 mentioned was.

3 MR. TRIPP: I think in -- in -- in the one

4 is never enough, (f)(2) was just a complete answer to

5 that. And if Congress was going to draft a special rule

6 about the supply of an individual super important

7 component, you would have expected to see it in (f)(2),

8 and it's just not there.

11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

12 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14 please the Court:

15 I think it's extremely important to

16 understand how fundamentally the Petitioners and the

17 government misapprehend the nature of the harm that

18 Congress addressed in 271 as enacted. When the

19 Deepsouth solution was proposed by Senator Mathias, it

20 precluded the supply with no active inducement

21 requirement, the supply of the material components of a

22 combination that if combined in the United States would

23 infringe.

24 In the 1984 hearing that's discussed at page

25 29 of our brief, the United States -- the commissioner

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 of patents came in and testified that the United States 2 objected to that interpretation. They objected to the 3 topdown -- you know, not -- not totally all, and 4 proposed instead that Senator Mathias amend his 5 legislation to preclude what in essence is prohibited 6 domestically in 271(c); that is, contributory 7 infringement. That is the supply of a single, specially 8 designed part where there are no substantial 9 non-infringing uses. 10 That in and of itself shows you how far -11 and that is, in fact, 271(f)(2). And that shows you how 12 far from this "all or substantially all" paradigm 13 Congress was aiming. 14 Now, Senator Mathias's response right 15 there -- and again, we discuss it at page 29 -- was, 16 okay, I understand that. But what about, he said, the 17 situation of the, quote, exporter who sends specific 18 instructions on how to manufacture a product which would 19 infringe a U.S. patent notwithstanding the use of a 20 staple product or products? 21 And Commissioner Mossinghoff's response was, 22 gee, I hadn't thought of that. That would be the analog 23 to 271(b). That is the induced infringement requirement 24 which makes one liable as an infringer if you actively 25 induce infringement by another and --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
31 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're -- but 2 you're -- you're beginning with a dialogue at a Senate 3 hearing on the bill that's pretty weak even in the 4 legislative history hierarchy, but I don't think you've 5 mentioned the actual language of the statute yet. 6 MR. WAXMAN: Well, that -- thank you, 7 Mr. Chief Justice. And I'm not relying on the 8 legislative history alone. This is just one example 9 in -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how does it help you? 11 Because I -- it's very hard for me to believe that 12 Senator Mathias really wanted to interpret American 13 patent law so that it runs the world when we've entered 14 into a treaty which says British patent law runs 15 Britain, French France, and so forth. I mean, is there 16 something in this history which says no, no, Senator 17 Mathias had a different view; he -- he wanted whenever 18 you send any component abroad that's in a patent, 19 suddenly American law governs it? 20 MR. WAXMAN: So, Justice Breyer, before I go 21 back to the history, I'll take the Chief Justice's 22 admonition and -- and -- and focus on the language. 23 I mentioned the history, Mr. Chief Justice, 24 only because it's rare that an exchange in the 25 legislative history translates so directly to the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 language of the statute as a result of that exchange

32

2 which we're not relying on as interpretive authority.

3 Senator Mathias did exactly what the United States

4 suggested. He -- he scrapped the original -- the

5 material components and came back with what is now

6 271(f)(1) and (f)(2).

7 (f)(1), modeled on 271(b), precludes active

8 inducement in the United States, and 271(f)(2) precludes

9 following on 271(c).

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know. But I

11 mean, you know, you know the objection. I don't -- I

12 don't know how many of the people voting on the bill

13 went back and read the Senate hearing.

14 I understand the argument when you're

15 talking about something in the Senate Report or the

16 House Report at a fairly high level of connection to the

17 statute. But when you're wading into the particular --

18 the dialogues at a particular hearing in one House --

19 one committee of one House of the Congress, that's a

20 real stretch.

21 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Let me -- let me -- let

22 me put aside that exchange. The -- the -- in fact, the

23 report does acknowledge what is obvious from the face of

24 the statute and which I believe -- and this Court

25 recognized in Microsoft v. AT&T, which is the 271

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 provisions were modeled after induced infringement under 2 271(b) and contributory infringement under 271(c). And 3 -- and -4 JUSTICE ALITO: What about the -- what about 5 the text of the -- of the statute? It doesn't say "a 6 substantial portion of the patented invention." It says 7 "a substantial portion of the components" of -- of the 8 patented invention. 9 So if I were to -- you know, if I were to 10 ask, what is a substantial portion of the pages of your 11 brief, I think someone would think that's a quantitative 12 determination and -- and would not think that, well, you 13 know, I think pages 12 to 16 of your brief are 14 particularly important, so that would be a substantial 15 portion of the -- of the pages of your brief. 16 MR. WAXMAN: So I -- let me go first to 17 the -- to the question about the use of the word 18 "components" rather than "invention" and then address 19 your -- your question on the substantial number of 20 pages. 21 As this Court explained in Microsoft 22 v. AT&T, the use of the word "components" is the -- is 23 Congress's indication that the combinations that are 24 precluded are tangible or physical combinations, not 25 method patents or unembodied software. That's how you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 know what the scope of the combination is.

34

2 And if Congress had said, you know, to

3 export one or more rather than a substantial portion,

4 you would still use the plural because the plural is

5 necessary to accommodate the instance in which it will,

6 in fact, commonly be more than one.

7 Now, in your hypothetical, if you're talking

8 about a substantial portion of units that are

9 indistinguishable from each other, like pages of the

10 brief, then I concede that the more natural reading is a

11 quantitative one. But if you look at how "substantial"

12 is used in the relevant provisions, the provisions of

13 the patent code that my friend on the other side is

14 averting to, that is (f)(2), where substantial

15 non-infringing uses is plainly at least partly

16 qualitative, or, as they say, the Warner-Jenkinson, the

17 doctrine of equivalence case where equivalency turns on

18 substantiality of functions and methods and uses, it is

19 also qualitative, our argument is that, again, we agree

20 with the United States whether the extent to which

21 substantial is qualitative or quantitative depends on

22 the context.

23 And so my only point, Mr. Chief Justice,

24 just so that I'm not misunderstood here, is Congress --

25 when Congress, rather than what it started to do, which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
35 1 was to count down -- enact something that counted down 2 from all the components, it instead scrapped it at the 3 United States' suggestion and started from the ground up 4 from contributory infringement, which is just one 5 component specially designed, and active inducement, 6 which doesn't require the supply of any components. 7 Now, in this instance, and this goes, I 8 think, to Justice Breyer's question about 9 extraterritoriality, Congress was very careful -- of 10 course, as this Court recognized in Microsoft, there are 11 extraterritorial implications because it concerns 12 exporting things for something to be done in commerce 13 overseas. But Congress was very, very careful to make 14 the conduct that the provision looks at domestic only. 15 It is -- you have to actively induce from the United 16 States an active inducement, this Court explained in the 17 Grokster case means active steps to encourage like 18 advertising or providing instructions. You have to 19 support -20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do -- what do 21 you do with the word "all"? I take it your argument 22 would be easier if that word were not in the statute. 23 MR. WAXMAN: I don't -- I don't -- I'm 24 not -- I don't -- I don't agree that our argument would 25 be easier. All, you know, has the same implications one
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 way or the other, whether you call substantial

36

2 quantitative or qualitative. Clearly Congress was

3 aiming at less than all.

4 But it's a commonplace for -- for

5 legislatures for completeness' sake to say all or fewer

6 than all, or all or some. And, Justice Breyer, I do

7 want to correct one thing. You -- you inadvertently

8 kept saying this is all or substantially all. It's not

9 all or substantially all. It's all or a substantial

10 portion. And as we point out in, I believe, page 35 of

11 our brief, there are -- it is a commonplace locution in

12 State statutes and probably Federal statutes to use all

13 or substantially all, which is more clearly

14 quantitative. And the State statutes, these are often

15 corporate law statutes that talk about the sale or

16 alienation of all or substantially all of the assets.

17 In that instance, the stake -- the cases we

18 cited and many others give "substantially all" a

19 quantitative as well as a qualitative interpretation.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it against the law?

21 Which I don't know. Is it against the law for a

22 patentholder on patent X, which has 19 ingredients, to

23 send one commonplace ingredient over to England and say,

24 you know, I -- I don't mind. Here -- here is what my

25 patent's on here, but there is no British patent. And I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 would love you to make this and sell it in Britain. Is 2 that against American law? 3 MR. WAXMAN: It is not for two reasons. 4 One, what -- what you have to show under 271(f) is the 5 act of active inducement that is -6 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what he does is 7 just as I said. You know, I have a great invention in 8 America. It's patented. 9 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I got it. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: In England, it's not 11 patented. And what I really -- I see no reason why you 12 cannot make my thing over there and sell it over there. 13 And here, by the way -- it's not mine, you know. It's 14 Mr. Smith's, my competitor's. And -- and here, by the 15 way, is the patent. You see what it is, and go ahead. 16 Sell it in England. It's not patented there. Can you 17 not do that? Is that illegal? 18 MR. WAXMAN: So there you would ask the 19 question whether the component or two components -20 JUSTICE BREYER: If we leave the component 21 out of it. There are no components. What he does is he 22 sends him a list. 23 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. That is -24 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that illegal? 25 MR. WAXMAN: -- not illegal, because in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 addition to active inducement, you also have to supply a 2 substantial portion of the component. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. 4 MR. WAXMAN: Now, after that -5 JUSTICE BREYER: So then the question 6 becomes one of what limits Congress wanted to put in an 7 area where it isn't illegal. Now, go ahead with your 8 argument, because what they're saying -9 MR. WAXMAN: So if the -10 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Yeah. 11 MR. WAXMAN: Sorry. 12 If the component is -- let me use two 13 examples: One, I'll adopt Justice Alito's hypothetical. 14 Let's assume that you have a patented pharmaceutical, a 15 tablet that, you know, remediates a disease. It has -16 as is commonplace in these combinations, it has one 17 active ingredient, and it has five inert ingredients 18 that are as easy to pick up as you can imagine. 19 The thing that is exported -- the -- the -20 the factory overseas, which by the way is never liable 21 under the statute because the statute only applies to 22 conduct in the United States, they -- they're happy to 23 go down to their local warehouse and get the -- the five 24 inert ingredients. 25 But the -- the -- the molecule that does all
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 the work, they import from the United States.

39

2 Now, my friends on the other side would say,

3 and I believe Mr. Tripp actually did say, if that

4 molecule has no non-infringing uses, it's illegal. But

5 if it's such a great molecule that it actually has

6 another non-infringing use, say it also powers the

7 injectable form of the pharmaceutical, which is not

8 patented, that what Congress intended to do was leave

9 this giant doughnut hole in the rule between the active

10 inducement of a commodity, that is, non-bespoke

11 component.

12 You have to -- you know, there's no

13 liability at all. You have to supply all or nearly all

14 of those inert components, or you have to show that, you

15 know, there, in fact, is a patent on the injectable

16 form.

17 Or take also the example that was at issue

18 in this Court's decision in Quanta Computer. Justice

19 Thomas explained for the Court that that was a case that

20 involved the patent exhaustion doctrine where Intel was

21 supplying a very sophisticated microchip, microprocessor

22 that was used by Quanta Computer in a computer that had,

23 you know, gazillion other components.

24 And the question was whether Intel's sale of

25 the microprocessor to LGE, which then sold it to Quanta,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 exhausted the patent. And what this Court said is,

40

2 well, it didn't exhaust the patent on the combination,

3 because, obviously, it's only one or two components.

4 But because that microchip -- that

5 microprocessor embodied the -- what it said was the

6 inventive aspect of the computer as a whole, we are

7 going to take account of that and hold that patent

8 exhaustion applies. And that would apply not only to my

9 pharmaceutical example or Justice Alito's, you know, one

10 super important component, it would apply to a more --

11 you know, the Quanta example where there may be -- say

12 there are 20 components, but three of them constitute

13 the inventive aspect.

14 This -- the language is capacious enough and

15 can be read in a commonsense way to make clear that that

16 is what Congress intended to address in (f)(1) by

17 enacting -- provided there is active encouragement for

18 the combination, by enacting the analog, the -- the (f)

19 analog to what is active inducement under (b).

20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So how do you decide --

21 here there are five.

22 MR. WAXMAN: Yeah.

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And only one is

24 manufactured in the United States.

25 MR. WAXMAN: So --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under your test, where 2 there are five, and let's assume that each one is 3 necessary to the operation of the patented device, how 4 do you decide if one is substantial, one out of five? 5 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I'm going to answer your 6 question, but first of all, let me simply correct a 7 couple of statements by my friend, I think in response 8 to your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg. 9 The evidence in this case was that as to 10 300-plus million of the 700 million in sales, two 11 components were supplied. There was a -- there was a 12 concession at trial that both primers and the Taq 13 polymerase were supplied for almost half of the kits. 14 Second of all, Taq polymerase, 15 notwithstanding my friend's reference to what he found 16 on the Internet, the testimony at trial is that the Taq 17 polymerase that is necessary to make these STR kits 18 sufficiently reliable to be commercially salable was -19 and there was testimony about this at trial -- was a 20 form of very particular Taq polymerase made by Roche 21 called AmpliGold Plus, which is a particular form, and 22 was required, and the testimony at trial was, was 23 manufactured by Roche, Promega, and Life only in the 24 United States. This is not your Amazon.com Taq that's 25 now available.

42 1 Now, as to your question, Justice Ginsburg, 2 the question of whether in this case, whether it was 3 stipulated -- it was conceded there were five 4 components, although I must say I'm not sure that's 5 right, that of the five components, one or two were 6 exported. 7 And as -- and the question is how do you 8 know whether that one or two is sufficient? That was 9 addressed as a factual question by the jury, and -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what were the 11 instructions? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Excuse me? 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how in the world 14 would a jury go about deciding that? 15 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's interesting in this 16 case because for other reasons, Life Technologies at 17 other points of the trial wanted to emphasize just how 18 important and unique this form of Taq was. It didn't 19 actually argue to the jury that it wasn't a substantial 20 portion. Our lawyers argued in their -- in their 21 initial closing and on rebuttal, look, these kits all 22 had Taq polymerase. That is a substantial component. 23 There was no request that the jury be 24 instructed as to how you determine what is or isn't 25 substantial, and the way the Federal Circuit -- the

43 1 question for the Federal Circuit was, you know, is one 2 sufficient or is two sufficient? 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume the -4 MR.

They weren't 9 holding that one is sufficient in this case. They asked 10 whether there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury, 11 and they concluded that the answer was yes, because all 12 of the testimony -- and there were days of testimony 13 about how polymerase works and the polymerase chain 14 reaction. All of the testimony from our witnesses and 15 their witnesses emphasized just how important Taq 16 polymerase was. So I think it's substantial -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you've 18 finished -- I think you've finished your sentence. 19 So -20 (Laughter.) 21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you very much. 22 Justice Sotomayor? 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me that what 24 you -- you appear to be saying is still not answering 25 your adversary's position.

44 1 If there are, as I understood the expert 2 testimony from the briefing -- and I could be wrong, and 3 you'll correct me on that -- but assume my hypothetical, 4 that there are three substantial components in this 5 invention. How is one a substantial number of those 6 three substantial ones? Because unless you can explain 7 that, I don't know how to give meaning to "all or 8 substantially all" the components. 9 And -- and I do find the government's 10 argument that it's hard to say that "substantial" means 11 just something that's critical to the invention. Every 12 step is critical to an invention. You take out the 13 step, the invention doesn't work. 14 MR. WAXMAN: So it's not part of our 15 argument, and we don't think it's a fair reading of the 16 Federal Circuit's decision, that says, look, if the 17 thing won't work without a component, it's a substantial 18 portion of the component. That is a caricature of what 19 the Court decided. 20 The Court, as I said, was engaging in 21 substantial -- deferential substantial evidence review. 22 It recounted the fact that both their witnesses and our 23 witnesses underscored how important Taq was. It didn't 24 catalogue the pages and pages of testimony explaining 25 why that's the case.

I wouldn't say so. 7 But that's a caricature of what actually 8 happened in an eight-day trial that was very much 9 focused on Taq polymerase and the particular form of Taq 10 that was supplied here, and so this Court could, if this 11 Court agrees with us that there may be circumstances -12 maybe it's the Quanta example, or maybe it's Justice 13 Alito's example -- in which one component constitutes 14 a -- could constitute a substantial portion, and 15 therefore liability would apply if there were conduct 16 that amounted to active inducement, this Court could 17 then say, okay, we are going to roll up our sleeves and 18 we are going to read the trial transcript and we are 19 going to look at what the evidence was in order to 20 determine whether, on the case as it was tried here, a 21 reasonable juror could find that Taq polymerase was that 22 important. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in order to do that, 24 it would be necessary to know what "a substantial 25 portion of the components" means.

46 1 So what would you tell a jury that means? 2 MR. WAXMAN: So I would tell a jury, you 3 know, following the dictionary definitions, that 4 "substantial" means considerable in importance and/or 5 amount. And then, you know, the jury will -- and you 6 may consider, you know, whatever factors are introduced 7 in the case, just as when -- as this Court has 8 explained, when juries have to decide things like, just 9 adverting to your opinion announced today, what is 10 materiality? 11 In Basic v. Levinson, this Court rejected 12 the advocacy that you've got to tell the jury a lot of 13 primary conduct depends on what materiality means, and 14 what this Court said is, the contours of that will be 15 explicated based on the facts of the case and case law 16 as it develops. And in the patent context, this Court 17 has been -- I wouldn't say single-minded, but very 18 active in making -- in rejecting formulations that, you 19 know, help the jury determine what is obvious in light 20 of prior art. That was KSR. What is equivalent -21 substantial equivalent under the doctrine of equivalence 22 in Warner-Jenkinson? 23 These are all instances in which this Court 24 said the jury is given the standard, and it then applies 25 the facts and circumstances to determine it's met, just

47 1 as it does in negligence cases and in criminal law cases 2 and many other contexts in which primary conduct is 3 being adjusted. 4 Here, the -- the -- this parade of horribles 5 that, gee, anybody who supplies a component from the 6 United States could be liable if they are in the supply 7 chain is -- is manifestly incorrect. 8 They have to -- they have to, number one, 9 know that there is a patent. They have to know that the 10 product is going to be combined with others. They have 11 to know that the combination, if practiced in the United 12 States, would infringe. 13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do they have to figure -14 MR. WAXMAN: They have to go beyond that and 15 actively encourage, send instructions or blueprints or 16 something, in order to do it, and a jury, properly 17 instructed, based on the evidence, has to ascertain, 18 gee, this really is a substantial portion. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that -20 MR. WAXMAN: This is the molecule. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that -- that 22 sounds to me much more like (f)(2) than (f)(1), but 23 I'll -- I'll -- I'll look at that. 24 The -- the -- the brief by Agilent 25 Technologies was instructive for me as to how modern
Alderson Reporting Company

48 1 supply chains work. They say it's very complex. They 2 ship out hundreds of different things. And that seems 3 to me to give some help to the Petitioner, because it 4 shows that a quantitative test is simply a good baseline 5 to begin with, and the more egregious cases, it seems to 6 me, are under (f)(2) anyway. 7 If we have -- if we can think of horror 8 stories, they are mostly covered by (f)(2), aren't they? 9 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't think so, Justice 10 Kennedy. I -- I -- I guess I'd make two points with 11 respect to the supply chain. 12 The liability in this -- this is -- this is 13 a provision modeled on 271(b). It also includes the 14 requirement of the domestic supply of a portion of the 15 components. But the sauce here, where the rubber meets 16 the road, is that the -- the -- the tortious conduct is 17 the active -- active inducement, and somebody who was 18 simply responding to an order for supplies is in no way 19 at risk in this case. 20 The reason that (f)(2) doesn't really solve 21 the problem is, again, I think pointed out by Justice 22 Alito's question. You can have a molecule that has -23 that does all the therapeutic work in the world, and you 24 get -- and it is protected against circumvention only if 25 it has no substantial non-infringing uses.

49 1 Many of the most important, innovative, 2 inventive components actually are terrific because they 3 have two uses. In my hypothetical, it has a use for an 4 injectable form of the drug which is not patented. It 5 is not reasonable to assume that the Congress that -- I 6 was going to make a reference to the exchange in the 7 legislative history, but the Congress -8 (Laughter.) 9 MR. WAXMAN: -- that responded to the 10 government's suggestion like, let's just have (f)(2), 11 and said, well, we need -- we need (f)(1), too. That 12 is, we -- we need the analog not just to contributory 13 infringement, but to induced infringement, that they 14 would have seen these two components as so far apart 15 that their gears never mesh, when, as this Court has 16 said, it is a commonplace that there is overlap between 17 270 -- between contributory and induced infringement. 18 It's not a complete -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you need -- you need 20 (f)(1) to -- to -- to overturn Deepsouth. 21 MR. WAXMAN: Oh, no, no, not at all. Not at 22 all. 23 What Deepsouth said is, the patent is on the 24 combination. If the combination occurs overseas, there 25 is no infringement. There's no 271(a) liability abroad.

1 Congress didn't touch that.

50

2 What it said was, okay, 271(a) is direct

3 infringement; 271(b) and (c) are what we call secondary

4 infringement. It makes somebody liable even if they

5 weren't infringing, and because the combination overseas

6 doesn't infringe the U.S. patent, we are going to enact

7 these two provisions that address only U.S. conduct.

8 The -- the tort of 271(f)(1) --

9 JUSTICE BREYER: That's U.S. conduct, but

10 you read the brief of the German companies, and they

11 said it's a fairly common thing. We've been making

12 product X forever, and now we invest in an American

13 company, and lo and behold, we just want to import some

14 wood. You know, just some wood, and -- and -- and we

15 can't do it, because we'll be had up under this, because

16 wood is an important -- some kind of -- is -- 30 percent

17 of some kind of a patented thing that we've been making

18 for years.

19 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer --

20 JUSTICE BREYER: So they are worried about

21 it, in other words.

22 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I think that I -- I -- I

23 don't think that their worry is validated by a correct

24 understanding of the statute. Their -- their concern

25 makes no mention of the requirement that the U.S.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 manufacturer act -- not send wood, but send a

51

2 substantial portion of the components, which wouldn't be

3 wood or saline solution or something like that, and,

4 importantly, has to take the additional steps of

5 actively inducing.

6 And in Grokster, this Court, when it was

7 underscoring what "active inducement" means, said,

8 quote, "Showing that the infringement was encouraged

9 overcomes the law's reluctance to find liability when a

10 defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for

11 some unlawful use."

12 And that is -- that's the point. The point

13 here is that we're talking about conduct that occurs

14 only in the United States that must require -- that must

15 include the act of active inducement, specific intent

16 and knowledge, and a component or components that

17 constitute a substantial portion of the components of

18 the invention. And --

24 considered to be infringing?

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

12 MR. WAXMAN: The importation of the polymer

13 is not reached. A foreign -- a foreign assembler who

14 imports something from the United States is not touched

20 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22 I don't intend to use all four minutes.

23 First of all, what I want to respond to is,

24 you know, my friend has spent a lot of time talking

25 about active inducement and the mens rea elements of

Alderson Reporting Company

1 271. And I understand that, and that's certainly a

53

2 significant protection.

3 But Congress did not take 271(b) and (c) and

4 simply apply them in the (f)(1) context or the (f)(2)

5 context. What it said is, there has to be a substantial

6 portion, all or a substantial portion. And that's a

7 fundamentally significant independent requirement that

8 cannot be satisfied in a situation where you're talking

9 about a single component.

10 Justice Sotomayor, I just wanted to respond

11 to your -- you know, the three that are major, it's

12 important to recognize that two of those are clearly not

13 coming from the United States. So I go back to the

14 point you made later, which is, if there are three major

15 components, how can one of them be the substantial one?

16 I think the answer is, it cannot be under those

17 circumstances.

18 Justice Kennedy, you asked the question

19 about, you know, what are we supposed to do in these

20 circumstances as -- you know, with supply chains? And

21 the answer is -- you know, the answer that my colleague

22 gave you was one that basically says, this is a recipe

23 for the trolls of the world to go and chase down every

24 supply opportunity. And do what? Send them notice that

25 what you're sending is a staple article that's a major

54 1 component of a piece that's in the patent, and that if 2 you send -- keep sending that, you're going to violate 3 that patent and we're going to come after you. 4 And what's that going to do? That's going 5 to disrupt the supply chain in the United States, and 6 the ultimate effect is going to be twofold: Either 7 purchasers outside the U.S. will stop purchasing from 8 inside the U.S., or U.S. manufacturers will go offshore. 9 And the one thing we know that 271(f) was never intended 10 to do was to accomplish that kind of an -- that kind of 11 an impact -- negative impact on the U.S. economy. 12 I urge the Court to reinstate the -- the 13 judgment as a matter of law that the District Court 14 entered. 15 Thank you, Your Honors. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 The case is submitted. 18 (Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the 19 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 20 21 22 23 24 25
