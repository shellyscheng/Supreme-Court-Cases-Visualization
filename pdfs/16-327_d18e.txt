3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:09 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 this morning in case 16-327, Lee v. United States. 5 Mr. Bursch. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 Jae Lee accepted a plea based on his 11 counsel's assurance he would not be deported. Counsel 12 had it exactly backward. The plea resulted in mandatory 13 banishment from the United States. 14 No one seriously doubts that if Mr. Lee knew 15 the truth about his plea, he would have rejected it, had 16 the Sixth Circuit dispensed with this Court's totality 17 of the circumstances test for proving prejudice and 18 created a categorical rule. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in State courts, do 20 State -- are State courts mandated to follow what we do 21 in the Federal courts under Rule 11; that is to say, 22 before the guilty plea is accepted, to advise the 23 defendant of all of his rights? I'm sure they are. 24 MR. BURSCH: Yeah. I think in most State 25 courts they do follow that procedure.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
4 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do -- do they also tell -2 advise the defendant that if he or she is an alien, 3 there may be certain consequences to the plea? In State 4 courts, do you happen to know? 5 MR. BURSCH: I mean, in State courts, every 6 court would have their own version of Rule 11, and so 7 they're going to have some colloquy, and -- and I 8 believe those colloquies have changed somewhat since 9 Padilla. 10 I -- you know, and so one of the problems 11 here, if you look at what happened during the -- the 12 withdrawal of the plea, everyone in the court, including 13 the judge, thought that Mr. Lee was going to remain in 14 the United States after he served his sentence. 15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I don't quite see 16 that in -- in -17 MR. BURSCH: Let -- let me walk you through 18 that. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- at -- at 103 of -- of 20 the Joint Appendix, which is the beginning -21 MR. BURSCH: Yes. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The judge, after advising 23 him of many of his rights, says: Are you a U.S. 24 citizen? 25 No, your Honor.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
5 1 Okay. A conviction on this charge then 2 could result in your being deported. Does that at all 3 affect your decision about whether you want to plead 4 guilty or not? 5 Yes, your Honor.
 6 Okay. How does it affect your decision?
 7 I don't understand.
 8 And then -- and then he talks about it
 9 again. 10 MR. BURSCH: Right. And -- and then we find 11 out later, at the 2255 evidentiary hearing, 12 Justice Kennedy, that when he said I don't understand, 13 he then turned to his attorney, Mr. Fitzgerald, and 14 Mr. Fitzgerald said: Don't worry. This is a standard 15 warning that everybody gets. If the deportation 16 consequences are not in the plea agreement itself -17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except -18 MR. BURSCH: -- you will not be deported. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I'm -- I'm not sure how 20 much more the judge can do, and that at least argues for 21 our accepting midway ground of requiring Strickland 22 conspiracy -- Strickland -- Strickland doubt, 23 reasonable -- reasonable probability of -- of success if 24 you go to a jury. 25 MR. BURSCH: Well -- well, two -- two points
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 on that, Justice Kennedy.

6

2 First, with respect to what he heard from

3 the judges, what I would really like the Court to focus

4 on is the sentencing hearing colloquy, which is at pages

5 124 to 127 of the Joint Appendix. And there, it's clear

6 that everyone, even the Federal District Court judge,

7 believed that he was going to be released back into the

8 United States after his one year was over. She even put

9 him on three years of supervised release and told him to

10 give the probation officer his address once he was

11 released.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

13 MR. BURSCH: -- and that --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That goes to

15 deficient performance. I think we're beyond that, and

16 the question is -- is prejudice.

17 MR. BURSCH: Well, but -- but the question

18 there, at the colloquy, was whether he was informed at

19 all and how that prejudice -- to kind of combine the

20 response to yours and Justice Kennedy's question, what's

21 the standard that we have here?

22 And we -- we start with the baseline, which

23 is Strickland, is there a reasonable probability of a

24 different outcome, but that was refined by this Court in

25 Hill. And as we explain at length in the reply brief,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 the Hill test is whether there a reasonable probability 2 the defendant would not have pleaded guilty. And 3 here -4 JUSTICE ALITO: But is that -5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On that point, you 6 say the facts here support that -- that conclusion and 7 go through them all, but I don't understand how you'll 8 be able to distinguish any case in the future. 9 You say: Well, here, he's been here a long 10 time, hasn't gone back to South Korea, has he started -11 but I think someone who's just arrived might say: You 12 know, this has been my passion my whole life to come to 13 the United States; I don't want to go back. 14 You know, it -- it -- I'm not sure how, at 15 the outset, a judge can simply say: Oh, we don't need 16 to have a hearing in a case like this. 17 It seems to me that there would necessarily 18 have to be a hearing in every case. 19 MR. BURSCH: Well, there would at least have 20 to be a 2255 hearing to get those facts on the table. 21 But, Mr. Chief justice, what I want to emphasize is that 22 this is an objective test, not a subjective test. And 23 so it's not enough for a defendant simply to say: Well, 24 had I known, I would have rejected my plea. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it sounds like
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 a subjective test. I mean -- I don't know if it's

8

2 hypothetically, or we can assume it's actually, the idea

3 is that, even though the result of a trial is going to

4 be exactly the same, there's no reasonable probability

5 that he won't be deported, he nonetheless wants to go

6 through the trial.

7 Now that could be certainly characterized as

8 a subjective wish, not an objective. An objective

9 person would say: Well, it's going to come out the same

10 anyway.

11 MR. BURSCH: Well -- well, first, let's talk

12 about an example where you can see where the outcome

13 would be different based on objective, and then let's go

14 back to the facts of this case and show why it's

15 objectively rational here.

16 I -- consider a case where a defendant is

17 new to the country. He has no familial or business ties

18 to the United States; they're all to his country of

19 origin, and the sentencing disparity between the plea

20 that was offered and what could happen to him if he went

21 to trial is enormous. Say it's 50 years. It would not

22 be rational for that person to choose to go to trial,

23 because they don't have the connections.

24 But what we're talking about here --

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does rationality

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 have to do with this, Mr. Bursch?

9

2 MR. BURSCH: Well --

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We often get people who

4 come in and say I wasn't told about a plea, and I would

5 have pled guilty. And judges then look at the facts and

6 find out that the defendant was claiming he was

7 innocent, despite overwhelming evidence that he or she

8 was guilty.

9 MR. BURSCH: Yes.

10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Rock solid evidence. I

11 mean, not only is there a video, there's witnesses,

12 there's fingerprints, you name it, they're there, and

13 defendants will come in and say I'm not guilty. And we

14 say, you know, he's foolish, he's irrational. No

15 rational human being would not take this plea, the

16 difference between 50 years and five years, and yet, we

17 deny their motion to undo their plea because we

18 basically say it's subjective. This foolish defendant

19 wanted to go to trial.

20 I'm not quite sure what objectivity has to

21 do with making a judgment whether this particular

22 person, under their particular circumstances, would have

23 or would not have gone to trial.

24 Now, the factors you point to can support

25 that subjective wish. If the difference between going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 to jail or not is only nine months, I might say: Hmm, 2 hundred percent chance I'm going to be deported. And 3 the only benefit I get is nine months in my plea, which 4 is what happened here. 5 MR. BURSCH: Yes. 6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there's even a one 7 percent chance that I might be found not guilty, or at 8 least found guilty of possession and not something else. 9 I think I'm going to roll the dice. 10 MR. BURSCH: Exactly. And that's why, 11 here -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not irrational. 13 MR. BURSCH: It -- it -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I don't know whether 15 -16 MR. BURSCH: It's irrational, and it's 17 reasonably probable that that's the decision he would 18 have made if properly informed. And I -19 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't think that's -20 Mr. Bursch, I don't think that's a manageable standard. 21 I -- I see a number of possible standards that could be 22 used here. One is purely subjective: What would this 23 defendant have done? I understand the concept; it 24 creates a lot of practical difficulties. 25 Another objective standard would be, is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 there a reasonable probability of a better outcome if 2 the defendant had gone to trial? That's manageable. 3 That's standard Strickland. 4 But if the test is, would a rational 5 defendant have in -- have gone to trial given the -- the 6 sentence that would be -- that the defendant might face 7 if convicted discounted by the probability of conviction 8 versus the consequences of -- of deportation, I -- I 9 don't know how to do that. It's -- it's -- because 10 it -- it depends on how a particular person values those 11 two things. 12 MR. BURSCH: Well -13 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it -- is it irrational 14 to try to climb Mount Everest without oxygen? I mean, 15 is it irrational to swim with sharks or perform on a 16 tightrope without a net? I mean, I wouldn't do those 17 things, but people do it. I can't say they're 18 irrational. They're much less risk averse and they 19 value things differently. I -- I think -20 MR. BURSCH: Right. 21 JUSTICE ALITO: -- it's an unmanageable 22 standard. 23 MR. BURSCH: Well, I -- I think that the 24 rationality standard, which you articulated in Padilla 25 but not Hill, is supposed to be a low standard. It's a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 backstop to prevent the person from making the crazy

12

2 decision like Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, where if

3 the consequences of going to trial were the death

4 penalty and they had a plea on the table where they

5 could serve 12 months and then -- then be out, you know,

6 true irrationality. In most cases, like this one,

7 you're going to be dealing with a defendant who acts

8 rational, and -- and it's simply a backstop.

9 And when you're talking about giving up any

10 chance to stay in this country versus a 9- to 11-month

11 diminution in the sentencing guidelines range, I -- I

12 think that's not only rational for Mr. Lee or for you

13 and me, but for almost anyone.

14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- you have very

15 sympathetic facts, but suppose we change the variables a

16 bit. You know, they both can -- they both are a sliding

17 scale.

18 MR. BURSCH: Yes.

19 JUSTICE ALITO: So you have a much more

20 serious -- the potential for a much more serious

21 sentence. Let's say, if the person is convicted, the

22 person will serve eight years. And you have a person

23 who has many more ties to the country to which the

24 person would be removed.

25 Now, how do you make that -- how do you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 decide whether that's rational?

13

2 MR. BURSCH: Well --

3 JUSTICE ALITO: At what point does it become

4 irrational?

5 MR. BURSCH: Well, I think the starting

6 point is the Hill test: Is there a reasonable

7 probability the defendant, given all the objective

8 circumstances, would have pleaded guilty? And once

9 you've satisfied that, then you say, well, was this a

10 rational thing to do? And the Court shouldn't guess in

11 close cases. Again, it's a backstop to prevent the life

12 sentence versus a 12-month sentence defendant from doing

13 something irrational. In a case like this one, it's

14 easy.

15 But courts have to do this balancing all the

16 time. And the genius of Strickland was that we didn't

17 take any of those factors and say we're not going to

18 consider those, which is what the Sixth Circuit did. We

19 said, you're going to look at all the circumstances.

20 And so in your hypothetical, the length of the sentence

21 matters and the consequences matter.

22 Now, I want to take your --

23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't this case, Mr. --

24 Mr. -- is unlike Strickland in this sense? In

25 Strickland, so it's a trial error and the Court can --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 can determine whether it's harmless.

14

2 MR. BURSCH: Yes.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here, the plea is --

4 is a different thing. The plea -- there is no trial

5 error. And the defendant says, if I were properly

6 informed, I would exercise my constitutional right to a

7 jury trial. And it doesn't -- the Constitution doesn't

8 say I have to be rational in making that choice. I have

9 a right to a jury trial.

10 MR. BURSCH: Yeah. We agree with that,

11 because what -- what Hill made clear is that the trial

12 process and the plea process are two different things.

13 And I'll quote from Hill. This is 474 U.S. at 59.

14 Whether ineffective performance affected the outcome of

15 the plea process. Misadvice, as you're indicating,

16 Justice Ginsburg, causes a defendant to forsake their

17 constitutional right to choose a trial.

18 So it's a prejudice to the decision, Justice

19 Alito, whether to invoke their right to trial in the

20 first instance.

21 JUSTICE ALITO: But that points to a purely

22 subjective test, which, as I said, is conceptually

23 coherent, but creates a lot of practical difficulties,

24 because then the Court is going to have to try to

25 recreate what the defendant would have done. And, of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 course, after the defendant has been in prison for a

15

2 while and is facing deportation, the person -- the

3 person, I mean, I don't know, may have second thoughts.

4 It's very hard to recreate that.

5 MR. BURSCH: Well, it's not so hard, because

6 under the Federal statute for filing a 2255 petition,

7 you've got to do it within a year. You know, what

8 happened here is Mr. Lee found out, essentially the day

9 that he was assigned to a facility, that it was a

10 detention facility.

11 JUSTICE ALITO: But is that what you're

12 asking us to do, to adopt a purely subjective standard?

13 You say no.

14 MR. BURSCH: No, absolutely not.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is --

16 JUSTICE ALITO: What is --

17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your standard?

18 MR. BURSCH: Our standard is the same

19 objective standard you articulated in Hill, and that is

20 whether there was a reasonable probability the defendant

21 would not have pleaded guilty.

22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- so wait.

23 You -- even if it's irrational?

24 MR. BURSCH: Well, we're -- we're -- we're

25 willing to live with the Padilla language that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 decision --

16

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

3 MR. BURSCH: -- can be completely

4 irrational.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it's the same question

6 differently, but it's meant to be the same question.

7 What is the precise mistake of law that you think that

8 the Sixth -- that the Sixth Circuit -- that Judge

9 Batchelder made?

10 MR. BURSCH: Yes. Judge Batchelder in the

11 Sixth Circuit made the mistake of having a categorical

12 test, where instead of considering all the circumstances

13 objectively, she looked only at the likelihood of

14 success at trial to the exclusion of everything else.

15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm not sure she did

16 that. I thought that she said -- my reading of it was

17 she tried to follow what we've said.

18 MR. BURSCH: Well, if you look --

19 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and in particular --

20 in particular, she said, look, this person would have

21 been faced with a choice. So you started with your

22 example. In your example, it would have been nuts to

23 reject the plea bargain. The guy would have ended up in

24 the same place, deported, and he would have been in jail

25 for a lot more time.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
17 1 She says, here it's the same. He would have 2 ended up being deported anyway. The lawyer would have 3 had to tell him, your chance of winning this trial is 4 zero, near zero, close to zero, and you'll have served 5 an extra -- at least an extra 9 to 11 months because 6 you'll be in jail for 9 to 11 months more, and the same 7 thing will happen to you anyway. Who would want that? 8 It might be more than 9 to 11 months, because the 9 chances of departure are smaller. 10 Okay. So now I can repeat, and you started 11 in answering the Chief Justice: What's different about 12 this case? And I'd say there are factual differences 13 and there are legal differences. Start with the legal 14 differences -15 MR. BURSCH: Well -16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then tell us the 17 factual differences, why they matter. 18 MR. BURSCH: Starting with the -- the legal, 19 on page 4A of the Petition Appendix, that's where Judge 20 Batchelder reaffirms the Sixth Circuit decision in 21 Pilla, P-i-l-l-a, which says: If a defendant is facing 22 overwhelming evidence of guilt, then it's not rational 23 for them to do anything other than to take the best -24 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought she said only if 25 the only hope for him is jury nullification.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 MR. BURSCH: Well, she went on about jury 2 nullification, but the test in Pilla that she followed, 3 because it was Sixth Circuit precedent, was you only 4 consider overwhelming evidence -5 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 6 MR. BURSCH: -- in that -7 JUSTICE BREYER: So what we -- what you want 8 us to do is to add to what she said. And what you have 9 to mean by that is it would have been no hope for you at 10 trial. That's the reason. 11 MR. BURSCH: That's not really -12 JUSTICE BREYER: No hope for you. Well, 13 what do you want us to do? 14 MR. BURSCH: That's -- that's not the point 15 that we're making. 16 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the -17 MR. BURSCH: The point is you should never 18 focus just on one piece of the circumstances, the 19 likelihood of success at trial. You should consider all 20 the circumstances, like you said in -21 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's consider them all. 22 MR. BURSCH: And -- and -23 JUSTICE BREYER: And suppose one of them is 24 there's no hope of success at trial except jury 25 nullification.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 MR. BURSCH: Right. And -- and there's two 2 responses to that -3 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 4 MR. BURSCH: -- which are kind of legal and 5 factual. The first is that even a -- a defendant who 6 has virtually no hope at trial -- we don't concede 7 that's the case -8 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 9 MR. BURSCH: -- may still choose to invoke 10 their right to trial rather than take certain mandatory 11 banishment from the United States for the benefit of 12 only a 9- to 11-month reduction in their sentencing 13 range. That is both reasonable and rational. 14 The second is that there's a possibility 15 that with informed counsel, he would be able to bargain 16 for a plea that has lesser deportation consequences. 17 And we know that, again, Justice Kennedy, going back to 18 124 to 127 of the Joint Appendix, the sentencing hearing 19 colloquy, even the government thought that this plea was 20 going to result in Mr. Lee going back to his restaurant 21 business after his sentence was concluded. If the 22 government -23 JUSTICE BREYER: All Right. That was a good 24 point. So imagine that your lawyers below in this very 25 case went to the government and said, look, everybody
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 was under a mistake here. Why don't you go to the

20

2 district court with me.

3 MR. BURSCH: We --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: We jointly will tell them,

5 the judge, that not -- what would have happened if he'd

6 gotten good advice, is the government would have figured

7 something out to help him. The government would have

8 charged him with a -- a lesser crime. And my guess is

9 you did that, and my guess is the government wouldn't do

10 it.

11 MR. BURSCH: My -- my understanding is that

12 that hasn't happened, that the government took the

13 position that because there was no likelihood of success

14 at trial, game over. The Sixth Circuit got it right.

15 We would love to have that opportunity. And

16 the fact that we haven't had it is exactly why there's

17 prejudice in this case.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your -- but

19 your -- your rational defendant rule that you suggest

20 sounds almost like a jury question. What were -- did he

21 have lots of ties? Did he have lots of families, to

22 Korea? He had none? I just don't see how, A, a -- a

23 trial judge can do that other than on a strictly

24 case-by-case basis, which is nonreviewable. This is

25 just like a jury question.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 MR. BURSCH: Well, Justice Kennedy, the -2 the reasonable probability and rational bases tests 3 are -- are not our tests; they're your tests in Hill and 4 Padilla. And lower courts have been applying them 5 without any difficulty -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -7 MR. BURSCH: -- for many years. 8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but as Justice 9 Ginsburg pointed out, we have in -- in those contexts, 10 we -- we have -- we have a trial, and -- and Padilla -11 Padilla, I understand is different, but -- but it seems 12 to me that your -- you have so many subjective factors 13 that you endanger the system by having second -14 second -- second thoughts, people who want the second 15 bite of the apple. 16 MR. BURSCH: But like in any Strickland 17 case, when you consider all the circumstances, you have 18 individualized facts, not subjective facts, but 19 individualized facts that must then be looked at 20 objectively. 21 And -- and let's think about Hill and what 22 happened there. In -- in Hill, you had attorney who 23 gave affirmative misadvice to his counsel about parole 24 conditions, and that was enough for this Court to say 25 there was ineffective assistance, but no prejudice there
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
22 1 because he was unable to show a reasonable probability, 2 that had he known the proper parole conditions he would 3 be facing, that he would have rejected the plea. 4 But we have the exact opposite here. No one 5 denies that if Mr. Lee understood the mandatory 6 banishment that he was facing, of course he would have 7 rejected the plea and taken his chances at trial, even 8 if they were slim. 9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- but I think 10 several times in your brief and here today, you talk 11 about -- you say well, who knows what will happen at 12 trial. Well, that can't be the right test because 13 otherwise, there'd never be prejudice in a Strickland 14 situation. 15 MR. BURSCH: Well, but -16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, who knows 17 what will happen? Maybe the jury won't convict because 18 they get -- get it wrong. Maybe there'll be a case of 19 jury nullification. You say in your brief maybe the 20 government witness will die. I mean, it's all -- yeah, 21 of course you can't be certain about what's going to 22 happen, but if your test is right, then all the 23 Strickland cases come out the other way. 24 MR. BURSCH: No -- no, Mr. Chief Justice, I 25 want to draw a bright line, again, between posttrial
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 claims of ineffective assistance and plea-stage

23

2 ineffective assistance. Because after you've had a

3 trial, you can already see what the government's theory

4 is, what the defense theory -- theories were, whether

5 motions to suppress were granted or denied, how the

6 witnesses responded under the fire of cross-examination.

7 You have all that data and there --

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

9 MR. BURSCH: -- and the defendant --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't know

11 what would have happened if the attorney had not been

12 incompetent.

13 MR. BURSCH: But --

14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know what

15 would have happened if the attorney hadn't, you know,

16 not called the witness or not presented this evidence,

17 who knows what would have happened.

18 MR. BURSCH: But -- but you have this large

19 data set. And district courts are fully capable of

20 saying: Okay, what if this witness hadn't testified?

21 Would that have changed the course of the proceeding?

22 Yes or no?

23 But at the plea stage, you don't know any of

24 that. You don't know what's going to happen to the

25 motion to suppress. You don't know what's going to

1 happen on cross-examination. Now --

24

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: I would have thought that

3 the -- that -- that the difference is more fundamental,

4 which is that usually in Strickland, we are asking what

5 was going to happen at trial.

6 MR. BURSCH: Yes.

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: And we don't think, well,

8 there was this 1 percent chance that the witness would

9 drop dead. We put that to the side.

10 MR. BURSCH: Correct.

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: But here, the inquiry is

12 different. The inquiry is not the outcome of the trial.

13 The inquiry is the outcome of the plea proceeding.

14 MR. BURSCH: Exactly.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: And the plea proceeding

16 might be very affected by somebody saying, you know,

17 given my ties to this country, given my negative ties to

18 any other country, given the fact that this is only a

19 nine-month difference in prison term, I'm going to roll

20 the dice for that 1 percent chance.

21 MR. BURSCH: Exactly.

22 JUSTICE KAGAN: And that would be a

23 completely reasonable thing to do, a thing that many

24 people would do.

25 MR. BURSCH: Absolutely. Because that's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 kind of risk calculus that rational people --

25

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the key is that the

3 outcome of the proceeding here is not the outcome of the

4 trial, as it usually is in a Strickland case. The

5 outcome of the proceeding here is the outcome of the

6 plea negotiation.

7 MR. BURSCH: Exactly. Just -- just like

8 that quote that I read from Hill. It's about --

9 JUSTICE ALITO: All of that --

10 MR. BURSCH: -- that process -- the due

11 process.

12 JUSTICE ALITO: -- all of that is true on

13 the facts of this case. But I have to ask the same

14 question -- I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you

15 can change the facts. So you have a defendant with more

16 ties to Korea. He didn't come here as a young man. He

17 came here when he was 25 years old.

18 MR. BURSCH: Yeah.

19 JUSTICE ALITO: He still has some relatives

20 and friends in Korea. The sentence that he faces here

21 is much higher. Let's say it's five years or it's eight

22 years or it's ten years. At what point -- how do you

23 decide whether it's rational.

24 MR. BURSCH: Well, that's the job of the

25 district courts applying all the circumstances.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well --

26

2 MR. BURSCH: I hate to keep repeating that.

3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would you do as a

4 district -- how would you evaluate that as a district

5 court judge?

6 MR. BURSCH: Well, the -- the -- the first

7 question I would do is I would ask the Hill test: Is

8 there a reasonable probability that this defendant would

9 not have pleaded guilty? And if I thought the answer to

10 that question was no, then that's the end of the game.

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: And that is the Hill test,

12 right?

13 MR. BURSCH: It is.

14 JUSTICE KAGAN: We've said that.

15 MR. BURSCH: Right. And it's been in place

16 for years.

17 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, this is not your

18 test.

19 MR. BURSCH: No.

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: This is a test that's

21 staring at me on page 59 of volume 474.

22 MR. BURSCH: That's right.

23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that --

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's always --

25 JUSTICE ALITO: That's a purely subjective

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 test.

27

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's always --

3 there's always a set of degrees. I mean, whether or not

4 we talk about this rational person would have accepted,

5 how much of a defense and how viable is the defense?

6 Would 1 percent defense versus 20 percent defense,

7 30 percent defense? At some point the district court is

8 going to draw a rationality line that they think is

9 reasonable, correct?

10 MR. BURSCH: Correct. And -- and it's a

11 series of levers. Every one of those factors --

12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if -- if there -- if

13 there's a defense that has a 1 percent chance, is that

14 okay, versus one that has a 20 percent chance? Or how

15 do you even measure how rational a potential defense may

16 be --

17 MR. BURSCH: Well, the --

18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if the inquiry is how

19 much do we know he would or would not have taken this

20 plea?

21 MR. BURSCH: We -- we think that is the Hill

22 test, correct. And I don't think anyone doubts, the

23 government or even the -- the district court judge

24 doubts, that had he known, he would have rejected it.

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's no question --

But -- but -2 let's -- the question -- but the question that was -3 was -- was put to you with reference to Strickland was 4 in the context of what might happen at a trial with 5 different evidence, with different arguments. We know 6 how to do that. Judges know how to do that. 7 You're asking us how -- how to assess the 8 mindset of -- of the defendant when -- when he or she 9 makes the plea. That's very different. 10 MR. BURSCH: Well, I -- I wouldn't say, 11 because it's an objective test, not the mindset of the 12 defendant, but the mindset of a defendant in this 13 particular instance -14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I understand 15 you -- you call your test an objective test. You -16 you -17 MR. BURSCH: Yes. 18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I understand that. 19 But the question is whether or not it isn't so distinct 20 from Strickland as to be unworkable. 21 MR.

Because -25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. One more --

29 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Kagan pointed out 2 that the test that you're asking us to apply is the test 3 that this Court says is applicable at the plea stage. 4 Is there a reasonable probability, but for counsel's 5 error, defendant would not have pleaded guilty, but 6 would have insisted on his right to trial? 7 MR. BURSCH: Correct. 8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's exactly what we 9 said the standard is, and I think you're just asking us 10 to -- to adhere to that standard. 11 MR. BURSCH: I'm asking you to -- to 12 re-adhere to that standard, but also to reaffirm the 13 Strickland totality of the circumstances -14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- so is 15 this the mistake you say that Judge Batchelder made is 16 she said: I will assume, at least, that your client 17 would have said I want to go to trial. 18 Question: Would that have been a rational 19 decision? Some circuits say if there is overwhelming 20 evidence of guilt, it's never a rational decision. And 21 that's what we say. And you want us to say that's where 22 she was wrong. 23 MR. BURSCH: Correct. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: And so send it back with 25 the knowledge that sometimes it could be rational for a

3 could be, and my client's the guy.

7 overwhelming evidence is not always the end of the case.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the others, for

20 myself, I don't see how we don't send it back. I'm not

21 a trial judge. I don't really know how trial defendants

22 react, and -- and a trial judge does know that much

23 better than I.

25 extreme facts, you could conclude there's a reasonable

7 the absolute rule of this circuit is --

8 MR. BURSCH: Correct.

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what led this

10 district court judge to say I believe this person would

11 have gone to trial, but this rule doesn't permit me to

16 overwhelming evidence that this defendant, that the

17 defendant in the case would have gone to trial if the

18 defendant knew about the deportation consequences,

19 overwhelming subjective evidence, statements before the

20 plea was entered, but also, virtually no chance of

21 acquittal had the defendant gone to trial. What happens

22 then?

4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

5 Mr. Feigin.

6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

7 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8 MR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10 The crux of a Padilla claim is the

11 defendant's contention that if he had constitutionally

12 competent counsel, that counsel could have given him a

13 legitimate chance at avoiding a removal with

14 particular -- avoiding a conviction with particular

15 removal consequences.

16 A defendant can't prevail on that kind of

17 claim if there's nothing constitutionally competent

18 counsel could have done to create that chance. And

19 that's the case here where the lower courts found, in

20 the words of the court of appeals, that Petitioner had

21 no bona fide defense, not even a weak one, and stood to

22 gain nothing from going to trial aside from a longer

23 prison sentence, except for the off chance of jury

24 nullification --

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 MR. FEIGIN: -- or the like.

34

2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you'll agree that

3 there are many possibilities where it would nonetheless

4 be rational for him to choose -- where -- where it would

5 make sense for him to want a longer prison sentence,

6 right? Let's say that there -- he has a serious medical

7 condition. The medical care he's going to get at

8 Millington is better than what he's going to get

9 wherever he's going. He may get no medical care where

10 he's being removed to.

11 Isn't that rational for him to want to go to

12 trial with the expectation that he'll get a longer

13 prison sentence?

14 MR. FEIGIN: Well, two points on that, Your

15 Honor. First, when I think the Court is using the term

16 "rational" here, and where it uses it in Padilla as a

17 supplement to the "would the defendant go to trial" test

18 and says that the defendant has to convince the court

19 that it would be rational under the circumstances to

20 reject the plea, the Court is using the term "rational"

21 in its traditional legal sense. When we talk about a

22 rational jury and the result a rational jury would

23 reach, we're thinking of a jury that applies the law to

24 the facts and doesn't think about results like jury

25 nullification or happenstance.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
35 1 As to your particular question about whether 2 it would be rational, I think in a more common sense 3 way, to want that, that might well be true, Mr. Chief 4 Justice, but that's not the kind of thing that we 5 consider to be prejudice for Sixth Amendment purposes 6 understand Strickland. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Strickland, in 8 the typical Strickland case where you're talking about 9 the outcome of a trial, I understand that. But we're 10 talking about something different here. We're talking 11 about reasonable probability that he would or would not 12 have accepted the -- the plea agreement. 13 MR. FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, I'm not aware 14 of this Court ever accepting a claim that the 15 defendant's counsel was deficient because he didn't get 16 more prison time. And I don't think that's the kind 17 of -18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. But I mean, 19 you know, that's funny, but the -- the fact is this is a 20 situation where he might well have elected to have more 21 prison time because it would keep him in -- in 22 Tennessee, close to his family, where he would be able 23 to visit his children, where he could even, as I think 24 the judge suggested, have some role in continuing to -25 to run the restaurant.

It is -- so I don't think 5 I could accurately answer your question, Mr. Chief 6 Justice. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is -8 what is life like at a minimum security federal prison? 9 I mean, the judge here recommended a particular facility 10 close to Tennessee. I assume he -- he didn't seem to 11 want to sort of throw the book at the -- the defendant. 12 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's visitation, 14 right? 15 MR. FEIGIN: I think the premise that 16 someone is entitled to counsel who will keep him 17 incarcerated in the United States is not only contrary 18 to anything the courts recognize under Strickland, but 19 also contrary to our criminal immigration laws where 20 incarceration in the United States is the penalty for 21 reentry. 22 I also the -- say -- would want to make 23 clear that there's nothing in the record to suggest that 24 this particular Petitioner, had he known that removal 25 was inevitable for conviction, would nevertheless have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 opted for a conviction that would give him a longer

37

2 prison sentence.

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that might --

4 MR. FEIGIN: What we were discussing is the

5 rest --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: What about murder? Suppose

7 he thinks he's going to be murdered if he's sent abroad.

8 Same problem.

9 MR. FEIGIN: Well --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, I -- the

11 problem is that he -- which you can read Judge

12 Batchelder's opinion. I mean, it could be read, as he

13 says, that -- that if the evidence is overwhelming,

14 that's the end of the matter, and it wouldn't have been

15 rational to -- to ask for a trial. And now all we've

16 done is think of situations where it might be. I mean,

17 he thinks he's going to be sent back to some country in

18 the world and it's going to end up he's dead, as is his

19 family. He'd rather be in jail.

20 Now, we're not supposed to take that into

21 account? Why not?

22 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, there's a

23 real disconnect between the claim the Petitioner is

24 bringing and the relief that he's seeking. The reason

25 that he is subject to removal is not because of any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 misadvice counsel made. It's because a rational -- any 2 rational jury, the lower courts found, applying the law 3 to the facts, would have convicted him -4 JUSTICE KAGAN: You see -5 MR. FEIGIN: -- of dealing drugs -6 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that's confusing two 7 things. And this goes back to the point that the Chief 8 Justice made, is that you keep on saying what's the 9 probability that the jury wouldn't have convicted him, 10 but that's not the question, and we made this clear in 11 Hill and in other cases. 12 The question is: What's the -- what's the 13 -- what's the probability that the relevant proceeding 14 would have been different? And here the relevant 15 proceeding is the plea negotiation and the plea 16 agreement. And that's the thing that we're looking at 17 is did this deficient performance lead to a different 18 decision by this -- by Mr. Lee to go to trial or not, to 19 plea or not. And that's all we're supposed to be 20 looking at here, according to Hill. 21 Now, that has its difficulties, as 22 Justice Alito said. What exactly do we look to? How do 23 we draw lines? There's no question that this is, in 24 some cases, an uncomfortable inquiry. But that's the 25 inquiry we're supposed to be making, isn't it? And you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 keep flipping it to a different inquiry, which is the 2 inquiry in a trial context, but not in a plea context. 3 MR. FEIGIN: That's because, Justice Kagan, 4 I -- I don't actually think that's purely the inquiry 5 we're supposed to be making here. I don't think Hill or 6 any other case in this Court's Strickland line values 7 the right to go to trial -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry -9 MR. FEIGIN: -- early in the -10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry -11 JUSTICE KAGAN: This is what -- this is what 12 Hill says, Mr. Feigin. It just says, here's the 13 standard: The defendant must show that there's a 14 reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, he 15 would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on 16 going to trial. 17 That's what we're trying to determine, 18 whether he would have insisted on going to trial. 19 MR. FEIGIN: Well, let me say a few things 20 about that. First, right after that, Hill looks at the 21 right to go to trial through the lens of an attorney, 22 and whether the reasonable attorney, who's just looking 23 at the outcome of the trial, would have advised the 24 defendant to go to trial. But also -25 JUSTICE KAGAN: So to the contrary, when
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Hill keeps on going, it says, you know, this -- this

40

2 defendant didn't care about his parole eligibility, so

3 we shouldn't -- we shouldn't look at the fact that

4 the -- the parole eligibility was a bad deal for him

5 because he didn't care.

6 So the emphasis clearly in Hill is -- is

7 what are the things that would have made a difference --

8 MR. FEIGIN: Well --

9 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- in the plea negotiation?

10 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, the particular

11 defendant in Hill didn't even get to the objective part

12 of the inquiry we're discussing today because he failed

13 at the outset. There wasn't even an allegation that he

14 subjectively would have selected a trial.

15 But I also point the Court to Padilla where

16 it lays out the test from Hill and says, moreover, a

17 defendant in these circumstances needs to convince the

18 court that it would be rational under the circumstances

19 to reject the plea.

20 And finally, another good place to look

21 would be --

22 JUSTICE KAGAN: What Padilla is saying,

23 isn't it, Mr. Feigin, is essentially, look, this is not

24 going to be a case where somebody can just get up and

25 say this is what I would have done and the court has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 accept it.

41

2 No, Padilla says. The court doesn't have to

3 accept every claim that a defendant makes. A court can

4 test those claims against a notion of rationality,

5 against a notion of what reasonable people would do.

6 But still, the -- the essence of the inquiry is what

7 would -- what would have happened at the plea

8 negotiation, not what would have happened at the trial.

9 MR. FEIGIN: Well, with respect, Justice

10 Kagan, I think, as the discussion when my friend was up

11 here demonstrated, I don't think a court can reasonably

12 do that. As the Chief Justice pointed out, there might

13 be somebody who hasn't been in the United States very

14 long and doesn't have the ties that this defendant has

15 who says, well, all my life I've been waiting to come to

16 the United States, and so it's perfectly rational for me

17 to roll the dice.

18 The -- the last place I would look -- point

19 you to for the fact that trials are treated as

20 instrumental under Strickland, not as ends in and of

21 themselves, is the Court's most recent Strickland

22 decisions in Cooper and Frye, which look to the outcome

23 of what would have happened in the combined trial/plea

24 process, and in fact, find the defendant's election to

25 go to trial was prejudicial where there was a plea offer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 on the table before he went to trial that would have

42

2 given him a better overall outcome.

3 I think this makes a great deal of sense,

4 because if you're granting relief to defendants in

5 circumstances where a rational jury would have convicted

6 them had they gone to trial, you're giving them windfall

7 relief that they couldn't reasonably have expected at

8 the time.

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the windfall?

10 You're entitled to a constitutional trial. But putting

11 that aside, you're not entitled to a plea. You're not

12 entitled to a lesser sentence. You're entitled to go to

13 jail if you want to. Isn't that what we said in

14 Dominguez Benitez in a Rule 11 Strickland evaluation?

15 We said that a court should, quote, "Not

16 second guess a defendant's actual decision if it is

17 reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent

18 the error, it is no matter that the choice may have been

19 foolish."

20 Now, that's Strickland under Rule 11, and

21 it's the same inquiry. Would he have pled guilty if he

22 had known this information? And we explicitly said your

23 decision can be foolish.

24 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, while

25 Dominguez Benitez draws some analogies to Strickland,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 it's a slightly different test.

43

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not an analogy. It

3 talks about Strickland in the Rule 11 context.

4 MR. FEIGIN: I think the Court made clear in

5 Gonzalez-Lopez that the Sixth Amendment right to

6 effective assistance of counsel actually includes the

7 prejudice itself, which isn't true of the Rule 11 right

8 that was issued in Dominguez Benitez. Attorney errors

9 come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and the kind of

10 error that amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel

11 is one that prejudiced the defense. So you have to --

12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So here we have a

13 defense attorney who says: I didn't know the law. I

14 told him he wouldn't be deported. And if I had known

15 the law, I would have told him to go to trial.

16 MR. FEIGIN: Well --

17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this is both

18 prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to

19 go -- move forward.

20 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I think you have to

21 also --

22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or not move forward.

23 MR. FEIGIN: I think you have to also look

24 whether there was prejudice in the outcome. And I

25 actually think this is clear, if we -- if you'll bear

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
44 1 with me for a second, if you think about an example that 2 comes straight from Hill. 3 So let's take a defendant where there is 4 overwhelming evidence that he committed, say, a bank 5 robbery: Forensic evidence, video evidence, what have 6 you. And that defendant's complaint is that his 7 attorney didn't adequately investigate. And the 8 attorney did nothing to investigate. He just said, why 9 don't you plead guilty. 10 And it turns out, had the attorney 11 investigated, he would have come up with 20 character 12 witnesses, all of whom would have testified this is a 13 great guy and he just needed money because one of his 14 children was sick. And let's say the defendant, because 15 he has a sick child, would have done anything to avoid 16 prison time. 17 Under the analysis that goes from page 59 to 18 page 60 in Hill, that defendant, even if we subjectively 19 believed him that he would have selected trial, is not 20 entitled to Strickland relief if his only chance of 21 prevailing at trial was jury nullification or some off 22 chance of some external circumstance handicapping the 23 government's case. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: So step back a second. And 25 I agree with you. I can't find total clarity in -- in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 these decisions. And it seemed to me that if we're

45

2 making the separation, as they made, between what you

3 look to, to show prejudice in a plea agreement and at a

4 trial, both Strickland errors, it must be that the

5 constitutional consideration of not really wanting a

6 person to feel he has to give up his right to a jury

7 trial, that influences the standard. And if it doesn't

8 influence the standard, I have a harder time deciding

9 the cases.

10 So, really, I think what we're deciding here

11 is to what extent it influences the standard.

12 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --

13 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and -- and you --

14 you see how I'm thinking that?

15 MR. FEIGIN: Well --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: Because there's a kind of

17 just look to the plea, just look to the plea. Don't

18 give a damn about what happens at trial. Well, we can't

19 get that extreme. So we say, well, we'll look just at

20 the plea. But if it's just overwhelming, then we're

21 going to say we're looking to the trial, too. Okay.

22 If I'm right as to what these cases mean,

23 then we are in a world where 95 percent of the people

24 and what happens to them depend upon pleas, not upon

25 trials. And doesn't that argue for "look to that plea"

46 1 part of the thing? Don't worry so much about whether 2 he'd been convicted at trial. In other words, we're 3 talking about very small degrees here. But that factor 4 seems to me to -- to push in the direction of, if you 5 really think he would have gone to trial, that should be 6 the end of it, even if he's pretty irrational. 7 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I don't think 8 that's a good reason for under -- for unwinding reliable 9 admissions of guilt when we have a kind of outlier case 10 like this one where the lower courts were certain that 11 he would have been convicted at trial unless jury 12 nullification or some other happenstance occurred. 13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the answer to the 14 lesser-included offense? Was that -- is that out of the 15 picture? 16 MR. FEIGIN: That is also out of the 17 picture, Your Honor. 18 So if I could just briefly recount the 19 evidence here. On a search of his residence, they found 20 88 Ectasy pills, over $32,000 in cash, and a loaded 21 rifle. Immediately after the search, he admitted to the 22 police, after being given Miranda warnings, that he -23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yeah, I know what the -24 MR. FEIGIN: Okay. 25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what the facts are.

47 1 But isn't it sometimes a prosecutor might say, I have a 2 solid case, the evidence is overwhelming, but this is a 3 nice young man and the jury might be sympathetic, so 4 rather than risk nullification, if you call it that, why 5 not give the jury an opportunity to convict him on the 6 lesser, so at least there will be a conviction? 7 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, there might 8 be cases where a prosecutor might say that, but the 9 question here is whether Petitioner has a constitutional 10 entitlement through the lens of ineffective assistance 11 of counsel to try to seek that kind of result. And 12 here, there is absolutely no evidence that the trial 13 prosecutor was -14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. 15 MR. FEIGIN: -- inclined to -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He has a constitutional 17 right to effective counsel. 18 MR. FEIGIN: And I think that -19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if he has that 20 right, aren't we depriving him of that right and the 21 right to a trial, both of them guaranteed by the 22 Constitution -- as I keep saying, a plea is not -- to 23 have his attorney try everything that is legally 24 permissible to try? None of these attempts -- and your 25 adversary went on for pages of the variety of different

48 1 ways for him to have achieved a nondeportation plea as a 2 possibility. Doesn't he have a right to have someone 3 try that for him? 4 MR. FEIGIN: No, Your Honor, not where 5 there's no evidence that there's any -- there was any 6 possibility of a better plea. The government doesn't 7 have any general practice or policy of -8 JUSTICE KAGAN: You don't mean that -9 MR. FEIGIN: -- deals that -10 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- Mr. Feigin. I think -11 MR. FEIGIN: Huh? 12 JUSTICE KAGAN: You don't mean that. I 13 think -- because I think what you just said was that 14 there's no constitutional right to go to trial when 15 there's no evidence? 16 MR. FEIGIN: Oh, Your Honor, I was answering 17 the question about the plea. I'm -- if I could 18 answer -19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Of course -20 MR. FEIGIN: -- the question about the 21 trial. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- there's a constitutional 23 right to go to trial, isn't there? 24 MR. FEIGIN: There is, Your Honor, but -25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Even if there's -- even if

1 there's very weak evidence on your side.

49

2 MR. FEIGIN: There is, Your Honor, but I

3 think we protect that ex ante much more than --

4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well --

5 MR. FEIGIN: -- post, and let me explain

6 why.

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let me just --

8 MR. FEIGIN: Okay.

9 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- finish the question.

10 I mean, you would agree that there's a

11 constitutional right to go to trial, regardless of what

12 the --

13 MR. FEIGIN: I think I'd have to, Justice

14 Kagan, yes.

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- regardless of what the

16 state of the evidence was; right?

17 MR. FEIGIN: That's absolutely correct.

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Which is the question that

19 Justice Sotomayor asked you. And she said, and why

20 isn't this correct?

21 So then the question is, has there been

22 deficient performance? And a person's entitlement to go

23 to trial and entitlement to stare at all the various

24 probabilities and to make an informed choice, that

25 entitlement has been taken away by the supremely

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
50 1 deficient performance. And that should be the question. 2 MR. FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, I think there's 3 several reasons why we would -- we value the right to go 4 to trial ex ante and not necessarily in the Strickland 5 context, whereas I've suggested I think it's much more 6 outcome-focused. 7 The first is that the touchstone of 8 Strickland is fundamental fairness. And we don't -- I 9 think both Strickland and Hill exclude the possibility 10 of jury nullification or happenstance precisely because 11 we don't think anything unfair has happened to a 12 defendant because he's been denied the possibility -13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Strickland is a very 14 different case in that -- in that way. Because what 15 Strickland says is once you're at a trial, you're right 16 is to a fair and accurate trial. And nullification has 17 nothing to do with a fair and accurate trial. 18 But this is before. This is when you're 19 trying to decide whether to exercise that right to go to 20 trial. And there, what you're entitled to is that a 21 lawyer be able to give you, in a nondeficient way, the 22 various circumstances, the various things that you would 23 consider to enable you to make that constitutional -24 constitutionally protected decision in a reasonable way. 25 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, we protect
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
51 1 the right to go to trial ex ante very closely and allow 2 a defendant to select that result, even when it's 3 foolish. But the difference when you're looking at it 4 ex post is that you're asking a judge to both evaluate 5 and endorse the idea that someone would seek these 6 extra-legal results, like jury nullification or simply 7 hoping that overwhelming evidence of guilt falls apart, 8 as a reason for unwinding a reliable admission of 9 guilt -10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, all you're asking the 11 judge to do is to say that in certain circumstances, it 12 is not beyond the bounds of reasonableness to throw the 13 dice in order to get an outcome -- in order to get -- in 14 order not to be deported from a country where you've 15 lived your whole life. 16 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 17 the bounds of reasonableness rationality test is a 18 particularly workable standard. And I think in cases 19 like this, it's just going to lead these -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Feigin, you know, 21 we're talking about cases like this, the circuits are 22 split. The vast majority of them do the reasonable 23 probability test and don't seem to have the problems 24 you're talking about. 25 Do you know how many of these motions there
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 are?

52

2 MR. FEIGIN: I don't, Your Honor, but I

3 also --

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's not a whole --

5 MR. FEIGIN: I --

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I mean, there's not

7 a whole lot of them.

8 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I --

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's a handful of

10 them. The vast majority, the motion for relief are

11 denied by the lower courts, not on the Sixth Circuit

12 rule, but on the totality of the circumstances. It --

13 it doesn't appear as if we're overwhelmed with these.

14 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I can't give

15 you a precise number, but if you search for cases in the

16 Federal and State courts in which, you know, Padilla is

17 cited more than five times, you get about 1500 results.

18 And I think that shows these claims are being brought

19 fairly frequently.

20 And under Petitioner's rule, I don't

21 think --

22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many of them are

23 being granted?

24 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I -- I couldn't

25 give you an answer to that, but I think under

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Petitioner's rule, many more of them will -- will be

53

2 granted.

3 JUSTICE ALITO: Because defendant --

4 MR. FEIGIN: It means that any time -- I'm

5 sorry, Justice Alito.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I -- finish your

7 sentence. I'm sorry.

8 MR. FEIGIN: It means that any time a

9 defendant can subjectively state that he would have gone

10 to trial and the trial judge finds it credible, which I

11 think you could under pretty much any set of

12 circumstances, the Chief Justice pointed out -- I'm

13 sorry, the sentence is getting a little run on, Justice

14 Alito.

15 JUSTICE ALITO: No, no, that's fine.

16 MR. FEIGIN: Then the -- then that defendant

17 will be entitled to relief and will have a new trial,

18 even though that defendant, when he actually faced the

19 choice as to whether he should enter the plea and was

20 balancing that against a trial, didn't have any

21 legitimate chance of prevailing at a trial.

22 JUSTICE ALITO: I -- I --

23 MR. FEIGIN: His chances were jury

24 nullification --

25 JUSTICE ALITO: I -- I understand the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 argument that the test should be purely subjective.

54

2 What would this defendant have done? There's language

3 in Hill that supports that. The language that says is

4 it rational under the circumstances is contrary to that,

5 as I read it, because rationality is not a matter of --

6 is not a subjective thing. It's objective.

7 But let's say it is a purely subjective

8 question. Then I think it's a question of historical

9 fact. So you have to have a finding of fact by

10 somebody, presumably the judge, in the 2255, and that

11 would be reviewed for clear error. Would that --

12 wouldn't that follow?

13 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think

14 you -- are you proposing a test where you just find the

15 fact --

16 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I'm not proposing that

17 test, but I'm -- I'm suggesting that that is the

18 consequence of our saying that the test is purely

19 subjective. We can't decide that this defendant would

20 have, as a matter of fact, gone to trial had he been

21 properly advised. That's a -- that's a factual

22 question, purely historic fact. It would have to go

23 back to a judge to make a finding of fact on that

24 question.

25 MR. FEIGIN: You mean in this case?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
55 1 JUSTICE ALITO: In this case or in any case. 2 MR. FEIGIN: I think you could ask judges to 3 make those sorts of -- of factual findings. But I think 4 one problem that Justice Kennedy brought up earlier is 5 there's a problem there of hindsight bias, and in some 6 cases, I'm not suggesting that that's true in this case, 7 a defendant telling things that aren't true in order to 8 obtain collateral relief and having an objective 9 backstop where we make sure that we don't give 10 defendants a chance in postconviction review that they 11 didn't originally have. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Feigin -13 Mr. Feigin, routinely papers come in from a Petitioner 14 who says, my lawyer didn't do X. Most commonly, the 15 lawyer comes in and says I did do X. And most commonly, 16 the district court says the lawyer told me I did X, and 17 at the pea -- plea colloquy I asked that question and 18 the defendant said yes, I understood that consequence, 19 and the court doesn't have a hearing. 20 A ruling in our case wouldn't change those 21 cases. 22 MR. FEIGIN: Well -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It wouldn't change the 24 cases where the defendant comes in and says I would have 25 pled guilty, but the lawyer comes in and says he
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 insisted he was innocent. I kept telling him the

56

2 evidence was overwhelming, that he should take the plea,

3 but he kept telling me I'm innocent. It doesn't require

4 a hearing for a judge to say that defendant would not

5 have pled guilty because he was claiming his innocence.

6 Those cases wouldn't change either.

7 Those are a good majority of the cases that

8 come before district and circuit courts.

9 MR. FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, what we're

10 talking about here is a set of cases where, as the lower

11 courts founds here, the only chance the defendant had at

12 trial was jury nullification or, frankly, some stroke of

13 luck that would collapse the government's case somehow.

14 And in that set of cases, it does not make sense to

15 grant a defendant windfall relief that gives him an

16 opportunity he could never have reasonably expected at

17 the outset.

18 I think the --

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I still go back

20 to -- to my earlier point, which is the difference

21 between nine years and five and ten years is very big.

22 For nine months and sure banishment? What's so

23 irrational about going to trial?

24 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, as I

25 suggested earlier in my colloquy with the Chief Justice,


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 I think rationality here has its traditional legal

57

2 meaning, meaning looking at it through an objectively

3 reasonable len -- a lens of objective reasonableness.

4 And I think that makes great sense here because if that

5 were not the case, then I think Padilla's promise that

6 the ruling would not really be opening Pandora's box,

7 but would instead be cabined by the requirement --

8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do we do -- what

9 do we do with all those defendants who reject pleas with

10 full knowledge and say a rational person must have

11 wanted -- should have taken this case. And so you

12 should vacate because I didn't take my plea. Don't look

13 at all the facts and circumstances. Don't look at any

14 of the arguments because it's only a rationality test.

15 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, we're not saying

16 there's only a rationality test here. First of all,

17 the -- there's a threshold inquiry -- and this is where

18 the defendant in Hill failed -- there's a threshold

19 inquiry that this defendant has to say I would have done

20 something differently if my lawyer had given me better

21 advice, constitutionally competent advice. And then, if

22 that is what the -- then if we believe that the

23 defendant is credible in saying that, we then go on to

24 the objective portion of the inquiry, which is the --

25 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Feigin, again

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
58 1 the -- just in your words, objective reasonableness, why 2 can't a judge find as to a defendant that it is 3 objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine 4 months for a shot at staying in this country rather than 5 being deported to a place that you don't know and where 6 you have no ties? I mean, you know, if somebody gave me 7 that choice, sign me up. 8 So I think of myself as an objectively 9 reasonable human being. 10 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think what 11 objective reasonableness means here -- again, I come 12 back to the way the Court uses the term rational that's 13 used in Padilla and the way it uses it to describe, for 14 example, a rational jury, is the application of the law 15 to the facts and what outcome we would have reached 16 there. And I'm not sure -17 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's an objectively 18 reasonable assessment, it's an -- it -- it would be an 19 objectively reasonable choice to exercise my right to a 20 jury trial in that context. And that's the question, 21 whether it's objectively reasonable to make a decision 22 different from the decision that I would have made in 23 this proceeding, which is the plea negotiation. 24 MR. FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, if you look at 25 the inquiry that way, I don't think it's acting as any
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 sort of meaningful check at all, because you could

59

2 always make the argument that, yeah, I would have risked

3 two more years, yes, I would have risked five more

4 years, and I don't know how a court can come in and say,

5 you know what, that's not objectively reasonable.

6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the court can do it in

7 the way that the Court has done it since 1985 when we

8 said that this was the inquiry under Hill. This is what

9 courts have been doing since -- for the last 30 years.

10 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think the

11 circuit conflict that we have here shows that that's not

12 what all courts have been doing. Another point --

13 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's what many courts have

14 been doing for three decades.

15 MR. FEIGIN: I'm not saying -- I'm not

16 saying that a court can't try to do that. I'm saying

17 that we -- it's very difficult to achieve reliable

18 results.

19 So Petitioner has an example on page 6 of

20 his reply brief of circumstances where a defendant

21 doesn't have very many ties to the United States and

22 just got here, and Petitioner asserts well, in that

23 case, he couldn't possibly have shown that he would have

24 selected a trial. But I don't think that's true. A

25 defendant could get up on the stand and say all my life,

Alderson Reporting Company

60 1 as the Chief Justice suggested earlier, I've wanted to 2 come to the United States and I -3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this is a 4 little -- little bit different question -5 MR. FEIGIN: Yeah. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but assume a petitioner 7 prevails and there can be no trial because the evidence 8 is stale or something. Can the INS still proceed to 9 deport this person? Does it need a conviction given -10 given his admission at -- at the earlier plea? 11 MR. FEIGIN: Right now, there is a final 12 order of removal, but that final order of removal is 13 based on his conviction for aggravated felony. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question is, can you do 15 it without the -- without the conviction? 16 MR. FEIGIN: Without the conviction for an 17 aggravated felony, there would be no basis for the 18 removal. He would be a lawful -19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There has to be a 20 conviction -21 MR. FEIGIN: It -- to -- to make sure I'm 22 giving you a complete answer, Justice Kennedy -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Sure. 24 MR. FEIGIN: -- he would need to seek some 25 sort of immigration relief from the immigration courts
Alderson Reporting Company

1 in order to -- in order to not be removed from the

61

2 United States.

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he would get

4 that, right, if the basis for the removal order was a

5 conviction that's been overturned?

6 MR. FEIGIN: He should be able -- he should

7 be able to seek reopening. If for some reason the case

8 is not reopened, he could seek judicial review of the

9 non-reopening. So he has various avenues in which to --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the government still

11 make the -- the case that even though the conviction has

12 been set aside, it has adequate proof and it wants to

13 present proof of the violation in the -- in the

14 deportation hearings?

15 MR. FEIGIN: I don't believe it would do

16 that just because it has evidence that wouldn't be

17 sufficient to convict. I don't think that's necessarily

18 going to make him removable here.

19 So I think if -- if a defendant's conviction

20 were vacated, he -- he would not be removed.

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do prosecutors ever advise

22 the court in open court that this is a deportable

23 offense?

24 MR. FEIGIN: I don't know whether they do

25 that. Under the new version of Federal Rule 11, the

Alderson Reporting Company

62

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know the court asked.

3 MR. FEIGIN: The court is required to ask

4 and -- and to advise.

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does counsel -- does --

6 does the prosecution ever comment in response to that

7 question? It's a colloquy between the defendant and --

8 and -- and does the counsel ever --

9 MR. FEIGIN: I --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- prosecutor ever

11 interrupt or intervene?

12 MR. FEIGIN: I think it's unlikely that the

13 prosecutor would interrupt a colloquy between the court

14 and the defendant in a Rule 11 context.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

16 MR. FEIGIN: I think prosecutors, of course,

17 have their ethical duties, and if they see some mistake

18 is being made, I'm sure they would speak up. And the

19 court is always entitled to ask the prosecutor if they

20 have a view.

24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

25 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
63 1 MR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 2 Two quick things. 3 First, I don't want to lose the point that 4 Justice Sotomayor raised, that this isn't just keep this 5 plea or go to trial. There's also the opportunity to 6 negotiate other plea alternatives. And we give a couple 7 of those in our reply brief, including one where there 8 was a defendant with two-and-a-half kilograms of meth 9 who was able to get a plea conviction with lessened 10 deportation consequences. 11 And my friend says there's no evidence that 12 could happen here. Well, that's because the government, 13 based on the Sixth Circuit categorical rule, has refused 14 to negotiate throughout the process. 15 If you look at what happened at that plea 16 colloquy again, even the government believed that 17 Mr. Lee was going to remain in the country. And the 18 fact that he was willing to serve seven years here 19 instead of just his one voluntarily rather than be 20 deported is strong evidence that there could have been 21 some other arrangement, a meeting in the middle. 22 Second thing about Cooper and Frye, my 23 friend mentioned that in that case, you did look at what 24 would likely happen at trial. Well, we don't disagree 25 with that approach. Under our approach, just like in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
64 1 Strickland, you look at all the circumstances. And the 2 Sixth Circuit's mistake here, Justice Breyer, is that 3 they focused just on one circumstance, not the rest. 4 JUSTICE BREYER: This is what they say. It 5 says at the end there that it's alongside -- I mean, she 6 says: Alongside -- we adjoin the second to the -- that 7 a claimant's ties to the United States should be taken 8 into account in evaluating alongside the legal merits. 9 MR. BURSCH: She says that because that was 10 the test. But then what she says on page 4A of the 11 Appendix, in Pilla -- again, the -- the prior Sixth 12 Circuit precedent they're bound by: We held that no 13 rational defendant charged with a deportable offense and 14 facing overwhelming evidence of guilt would proceed to 15 trial rather than take a plea deal. That's the problem. 16 So that the final thing, I think Justice 17 Kagan nails this on the head when she says the test has 18 to be did deficient performance lead to a different 19 decision? That was the -- the standard you articulated 20 in Hill. It's been on the books for 32 years. Justice 21 Alito, I understand completely how district courts might 22 struggle with that in tough cases, but they've been 23 doing that successfully. 24 And to the extent that there's any doubt 25 about whether that should be the test, Justice Breyer,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
65 1 you're exactly right. It's that consideration of the 2 right to jury trial that's being given up, the gold 3 standard in our judicial process. 4 So we ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit 5 and hold that Mr. Lee can withdraw his plea. 6 Thank you. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 8 Case is submitted. 9 (Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the 10 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
