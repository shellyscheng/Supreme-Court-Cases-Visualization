3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:22 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 today in Case 16-32, Kindred Nursing Centers v. Clark. 5 Mr. Pincus. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 8 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 9 and may it please the Court: 10 To determine whether a power of attorney 11 confers authority to enter into an arbitration 12 agreement, Kentucky applies the rule different and more 13 demanding than the rule for determining whether a power 14 of attorney confers authority to enter into contracts 15 generally. 16 The question in this case is whether the 17 Federal Arbitration Act precludes Kentucky from erecting 18 the special obstacle to enforce arbitration agreements 19 signed by an attorney-in-fact. To ask that question, we 20 believe, is to answer it. That's the very reason that 21 Congress enacted the FAA, to prevent discriminatory 22 rules targeting arbitration agreements. 23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose Kentucky had a 24 statute providing that an attorney-in-fact lacks 25 authority to do a -- a -- a number of things: Convey
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 real property, move the principal's residence out of

4

2 state, invest in foreign real estate, a few more

3 examples like that, or sign an arbitration clause --

4 arbitration contract. That's -- that's not this

5 statute, I know.

6 But at -- at some point, can arbitration

7 clauses be included in a -- in a list of items that must

8 be given special attention?

9 MR. PINCUS: At some point they can, Your

10 Honor. And I think the dividing line -- the statute, of

11 course, refers to rules that apply to any contract.

12 This Court has talked about contracts generally. We

13 don't think that -- that means that the rule has to

14 apply to every single contract no matter what.

15 If the rule takes its meaning from a

16 characteristic other than arbitration, to give an

17 example, if a -- if a State had a law that said all

18 consumer contracts have to be in at least 10-point type,

19 surely the court -- the State could apply that law to an

20 arbitration agreement associated with a consumer

21 contract.

22 The problem, obviously, arises if there's

23 some gerrymandering that puts arbitration in a special

24 category. And -- and we think the rule here fails for

25 several reasons, one of which is even the categories

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
5 1 that the State court said it was erecting really don't 2 hold up based on the objective evidence. But also more 3 importantly, the reason that arbitration was included in 4 this category is the very reason that the FAA forbids, 5 which is the conclusion by the State that arbitration -6 an arbitration contract is especially onerous, and 7 therefore, should be classed with other especially 8 onerous contracts. That's exactly what the FAA was 9 designed to prevent. So that's the -- the problem here. 10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how about a different 11 example, but more related in my mind right now. 12 Under Kentucky law, let's say, the power of 13 attorney requirements are strictly construed. That was 14 one of the principles that the court below used to 15 interpret at least one of the contracts. And as a 16 general matter, it states that the State requires 17 express consent to confer power to waive any fundamental 18 constitutional right. 19 Would this general principle be preempted by 20 the FFA -- by the FAA? 21 MR. PINCUS: Well, let me distinguish 22 between those -- those two general principles, Your 23 Honor, if I may. 24 I think a principle of strict construction, 25 fairly applied across a wide category of contracts
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
6 1 probably is something; in other words, if it applied to 2 all powers of attorney probably is something that would 3 pass muster under the FAA, again, recognizing that a 4 court would have to take care that that notwithstanding 5 the general rule, there wasn't some 6 discrimination-in-fact against arbitration. 7 I think the question about a fundamental 8 rights line, let me answer that in two ways. 9 First of all, in this case, we don't believe 10 that that's in fact what happened because we think there 11 are a number of fundamental rights that are not 12 categorized in the group that the State court mentioned. 13 And, in fact, what the State court did was identify four 14 or five especially onerous examples of intrusion on 15 fundamental rights and say they -- these are all like 16 arbitration. It didn't say all fundamental rights, for 17 example. Foreign selection clauses may waive due 18 process rights. There's no indication that they're 19 covered; the right to property, et cetera, et cetera. 20 I think -- so that's not this case. If 21 there were a fundamental rights rule, I think the 22 problem that it presents is whether that intrudes on the 23 judgment that the FAA made, that arbitration contracts 24 are not especially onerous as other waivers of 25 fundamental rights may be; and therefore, I think that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 case would -- it's obviously different than this one.

7

2 The Court doesn't have to reach it, but we

3 think even in that case, grouping an arbitration

4 contract with a contract to enter into a guilty plea or

5 something like that, I think is troublesome because it

6 really puts arbitration agreements in the very category

7 that Congress said they shouldn't be in.

8 JUSTICE ALITO: What about if the category

9 were fundamental rights that implicate the -- the

10 individual's life or health, so that you would have to

11 have an express provision giving the attorney-in-fact

12 authorization to consent to various procedures that a

13 terminally ill person might undergo, and if this were

14 put in that category?

15 MR. PINCUS: Well, I -- I -- I just want to

16 make sure I understand your hypothetical, Your Honor.

17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in this case, what's

18 involved here is care for a -- a person who is unable to

19 look after that -- that person's own care, an elderly

20 person, a disabled person in a -- in a nursing facility.

21 So what if that were lumped together with

22 consent to surgery, consent to terminate feeding, or --

23 or breathing for a terminally-ill patient. All of those

24 could be put into a category that implicate life or

25 health.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
8 1 MR. PINCUS: They could. I -- I don't think 2 an arbitration agreement would -- would fall into that 3 same category of implicating life and health. And -4 and also, I think it's important to recognize that -5 that, again, here the State court didn't say that all 6 decisions implicating life or health are subject to its 7 special express requirement. It -- it -- it identified 8 a couple of -- an abortion or adoption. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in Justice Alito's 10 example, just to take it a little further, suppose the 11 nursing home said you cannot enter here unless you sign 12 the arbitration agreement, and this is the -- this is 13 the only place where this person can go for care. That 14 brings it closer to some of Justice Alito's examples 15 because now there's a danger that the care can't be 16 rendered. 17 MR. PINCUS: Well, interestingly, what 18 the -- the Kentucky court held in another case, Ping, 19 that -- that actually a -- the power to make health 20 decisions would be interpreted to include the power to 21 enter into an arbitration agreement if arbitration were 22 a condition of admission. But in this case, because it 23 wasn't a condition of admission, it didn't apply that 24 rationale. 25 I -- I -- I think -- I guess the distinction
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
9 1 here seems to me the decisions about health that we're 2 talking about; operations, medicine, are a category of 3 important decisions that the State has the power to 4 decide about. 5 The -- the -- the problem with the -- with 6 the hypotheticals is that the FAA basically says the 7 State doesn't have the power to treat arbitration 8 agreements specially on the theory that they impose some 9 special burden on the parties to the arbitration 10 agreement. And so I think a decision by the State to 11 lump them together with those other decisions runs afoul 12 of the FAA. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: But the -14 MR. PINCUS: Again, not in this case. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: But the context here seems 16 different from the arbitration cases that we've had in 17 recent years. This doesn't involve an -- an arbitration 18 about the amount that you were charged for your cable 19 bill or for your telephone bill. This involves a 20 situation where an elderly person needs care. 21 And as Justice Kennedy's hypothetical 22 mentioned, it may be that the only facility that's 23 available, or all of the facilities, require the signing 24 of an -- an arbitration agreement which prevents the 25 assertion of tort claims and the -- the elimination of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 the deterrents that they provide may really implicate 2 the care of someone who is vulnerable. So this seems 3 like something that is close to or that it falls 4 squarely within the police power of a State. 5 Now, I suppose that there's a connection 6 here to interstate commerce, I don't know what exactly 7 it is, but on the assumption that everything is 8 connected to interstate commerce, I assume that this 9 falls within the FAA. 10 But you see the problem? This is really 11 taking the arbitration precedence that we have handed 12 down in recent years into a different category of 13 interests. 14 MR. PINCUS: Well, respectfully, I don't -15 I don't think so, Your Honor. The -- the courts 16 unanimously decided the Marmet case a few years ago, 17 which involved this precise context: An arbitration 18 agreement in the nursing home context. And there, one 19 of the arguments that was advanced in -- in opposing -20 in supporting the rationale that the arbitration clause 21 shouldn't be enforced was that tort claims and the 22 nursing home context is different. And the Court 23 expressly rejected that criteria. 24 And I think Congress's judgment in the 25 FAA -- and Congress has specifically looked at the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 nursing home context in recent years; there have been a 2 number of hearings and examinations -- is that there 3 isn't a difference between deciding claims in 4 arbitration or in court. And the amicus briefs filed in 5 the case, I think, recite some of the empirical data 6 that, in fact, in the nursing home context and in other 7 contexts, arbitration results for claimants are quite 8 similar. The differences are it's cheaper, the process 9 is cheaper and faster. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the 11 argument that this doesn't have to do with the 12 enforcement of an arbitration agreement? It goes to the 13 question of whether the agreement was ever formed or 14 made. That is, if it takes outside the power of 15 attorney, the power to enter into arbitration 16 agreements, so it's a question that goes to making that 17 enforcement. 18 MR. PINCUS: Well, two answers, Your Honor. 19 I -- I -- I think it does go to enforcement because 20 really the question here is what the Kentucky court 21 said: We are interpreting the power of attorney 22 document in a way that renders the arbitration agreement 23 unenforceable. I don't think anyone argues that any of 24 the other requisites of contract formation were not 25 present.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
12 1 But, also, this Court has never drawn a 2 distinction between contract formation and 3 enforceability in applying the FAA. And I think to do 4 so would open a dramatic hole in -- in the FAA, because 5 it would be quite easy for a State to say, for example, 6 an arbitration agreement requires notarization; no other 7 contract does. Or an arbitration agreement, to be 8 properly formed, must contain a provision that allows it 9 to be revocable at will. 10 And so it would be quite easy to -- to -- if 11 formation was ruled off limits, to allow very easy 12 circumvention of the protections of the FAA. 13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about the 14 Wellner -- the Wellner documents. As I read what the 15 court said in the first part of its discussion about 16 that, it just interpreted the power of attorney as not 17 reaching arbitration. So there it was just exercising 18 its ordinary powers of contract interpretation. 19 MR. PINCUS: I think Wellner is closer to 20 the -- to the issue that the court confronted in 21 Imburgia, whether that really was an ordinary contract 22 interpretation. And as we've explained, the argument 23 for enforcing it is that it expressly provides the 24 authority to contract with respect to personal property. 25 And it's been long settled under Kentucky law that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 choses in action, clauses of action are personal

13

2 property.

3 The court didn't apply that precedent, and

4 that seems to us to be exactly as in Imburgia: The -- a

5 situation where a generally applicable rule was not

6 applied in the arbitration context.

7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you think every

8 time a State court incorrectly interprets a power of

9 attorney relating to -- as it relates to arbitration,

10 that that raises an FAA preemption issue?

11 MR. PINCUS: I think the question is whether

12 the State court's decision fails to put an arbitration

13 agreement on an equal footing, as the -- as the Court

14 has said. I -- obviously, there's not going to be the

15 occasion or the ability for the Court to review all of

16 those decisions.

17 I think in this case there's obviously a

18 difference between the Clark situation where there was

19 no argument that the power of attorney was ambiguous; in

20 fact, the State court said it wasn't. That's just

21 applying a new legal rule. In the Clark situation,

22 there is this question about whether or not it was

23 ambiguous. But we think under -- under any reasonable

24 test, it -- it really can't be said to be ambiguous,

25 given the long-standing rule under Kentucky law and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 fact that the -- the power of attorney there, in a

14

2 separate provision, conveyed the authority to --

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. --

4 MR. PINCUS: -- bringing Federal lawsuits.

5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Following up on Justice

6 Alito's question, and I know Ping is not before us, but

7 applying your arguments to Ping, because the author of

8 Ping dissented in these two cases, do you think Ping is

9 closer to the neutral application of a contract

10 interpretation?

11 MR. PINCUS: I do, because the -- what the

12 court relied on in Ping was the absence of any general

13 authority to contract and the fact that the broader --

14 all -- what Ping provided for was the ability to -- to

15 invest funds, the ability to make health decisions,

16 and -- and the ability to essentially administer real

17 property. It didn't have a general clause relating to

18 the making of contracts or the making of contracts with

19 respect to personal property.

20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see --

21 MR. PINCUS: There was some --

22 I'm sorry, Your Honor.

23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. I was going to

24 say, Wellner is a little closer.

25 MR. PINCUS: Wellner is --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
15 1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it seems to me 2 that -3 MR. PINCUS: The difference in Wellner is 4 that Wellner does have a very broad clause that provides 5 for the making of contracts with respect to personal 6 property. And given the fact that under Kentucky law, 7 personal property includes choses of -- clauses of 8 action, choses in action, it's pretty clear. 9 And also in Wellner and not in Ping was a 10 separate provision that gave the attorney the power to 11 bring and prosecute lawsuits. So if the -- if the -- if 12 the fear was that that general power to contract with 13 respect to personal property somehow didn't extend to 14 litigation, there's a separate clause with respect to 15 litigation. 16 Now, the Kentucky Court said that clause 17 alone isn't enough because it doesn't relate to 18 arbitration or to contracting, but it seems to me the 19 combination of them is pretty powerful in -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a pretty 21 powerful -22 MR. PINCUS: -- explaining what's going on. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a pretty weak 24 argument that they've automatically made a special rule 25 for arbitration. They looked at, will the institute
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 settle and conduct litigation with no mention of

16

2 alternative dispute resolution and conveying personal

3 property, not necessarily contracting. There wasn't a

4 general contracting clause. So I think there's

5 arguments on both sides of that question.

6 If there is, what do you suggest we do?

7 MR. PINCUS: Well, let me take a little bit

8 of issue with -- with your -- with the predicate of your

9 question, because the Wellner power does say to make,

10 execute, deliver deeds, releases, conveyances, and

11 contracts of every nature in relation to both real and

12 personal property. So I think that is a pretty broad

13 provision that -- that was not present in Ping.

14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And, Mr. Pincus, may I

15 ask you a question about the wrongful death action,

16 which everyone agrees does not belong to the patient; it

17 belongs to -- to the survivors. And the same issues of

18 negligence on the nursing home part would arise in the

19 patient's suit as in the survivor's suit.

20 Now, who determines which one goes first?

21 Because if the -- if the survivor's action goes first

22 and the nursing home is found liable, wouldn't the

23 nursing home be bound by that in the arbitration?

24 MR. PINCUS: I guess that, in the first

25 instance, would be a question of Kentucky law, Your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Honor. I'm not sure how Kentucky law in arbitration

17

2 treats prior decisions. And I also -- since there are

3 different parties, I don't know whether Kentucky law

4 provides for offensive, non-mutual estoppel. So I guess

5 those would be the questions that would arise in that

6 context.

7 Of course, the Court has said most recently

8 in the KPMG case that the fact that there are claims

9 that -- that could be bundled together doesn't mean that

10 the ones that are subject to an arbitration clause

11 shouldn't be sent to arbitration.

12 So just to -- to sort of return to first

13 principles and -- and to elaborate on my answer to

14 Justice Sotomayor's question, I -- there are two -- two

15 distinct issues in this case. One is the general

16 express reference rule that the Court announced and

17 applied with respect to Wellner in particular. That

18 rule obviously also applies to the Clark power of

19 attorney -- I mean, applied in Clark with respect to the

20 Wellner power of attorney.

21 There's the second question about whether

22 the -- the language that -- that I quoted is

23 sufficiently clear that a decision by the State court

24 that it is ambiguous triggers the same kind of a concern

25 that the Court identified in Imburgia as -- as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 indicating that this is really a special rule targeting 2 arbitration, as opposed to the application of a neutral 3 principle. 4 Unless the Court has any further questions, 5 I'll save the remainder of my time for rebuttal. Thank 6 you. 7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 8 Mr. Salyer. 9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. SALYER 10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 11 MR. SALYER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 12 and may it please the Court: 13 Kentucky is a common law State in the 14 development of its power of attorney interpretive law. 15 It is not a uniform power of attorney act State. 16 Therefore, over time, the Kentucky Supreme Court and the 17 lower courts of Kentucky developed Kentucky's 18 interpretive rules regarding powers of attorney case by 19 case, again, over time. And -- and this is the rule 20 that the Kentucky Supreme Court has established in this 21 case below. The power to waive generally fundamental 22 constitutional rights must be unambiguously expressed in 23 the text of a power of attorney. 24 Now -25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is there such an
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 explicit reference in the power of attorney with respect 2 to anything other than arbitration agreements? 3 MR. SALYER: Is -- is there anything? 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there an explicit 5 reference -- to be effective, you've just told us, the 6 power of attorney has to explicitly state the -- that 7 disputes will be settled by an arbitration. 8 My question is whether there is any other 9 contract that in order to be made effectively in 10 Kentucky, it must be an explicit reference in the power 11 of attorney. 12 MR. SALYER: Oh, I -- I understand your -13 your question, Justice Ginsburg. 14 From -- this is the announcing of this 15 particular rule, but logically, from here on out, any 16 such actions taken by an -- a -- an attorney-in-fact 17 that might restrict the principal's free speech rights, 18 say, by entering into a contract with a 19 non-disparagement clause or some sort of confidentiality 20 clause, that would necessarily have to be spelled out in 21 a power of attorney. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words -- in other 24 words, for a number of years Kentucky had allowed powers 25 of attorney and the first time that one was called into
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 question under this theory was with reference to the

20

2 arbitration.

3 MR. SALYER: Well, Your Honor, here --

4 here's the thing about Kentucky powers of attorney. It

5 has been the law of Kentucky since 1912 that powers of

6 attorney are to be strictly interpreted and that the --

7 the third party deals with the principal by an agent at

8 that third party's own peril. Therefore, it is up to

9 and -- and incumbent upon that third party to be very

10 clear and understand what the agent is allowed to do.

11 And -- and -- and the fact is that it is -- the reason

12 that these cases have not come up is that the third

13 parties, the -- the banks, the -- the whatever that

14 are -- are receiving powers of attorney as authority of

15 agents for principals, they've always demanded very

16 explicit information in that power of attorney.

17 And this happens to be an instance where you

18 have the third party who doesn't -- who doesn't actually

19 want more explicit language in the power of attorney.

20 Have I answered your -- your -- yes, sir.

21 JUSTICE BREYER: So in Kentucky, I issue a

22 power of attorney to Jones and say, you have full power

23 to protect, defend and maximize the value of all my

24 property. Okay. That's what it says.

25 MR. SALYER: Yes, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

21 1 JUSTICE BREYER: And someone claims that 2 this piece of land over here that we thought belonged to 3 Smith belongs to him under various deeds. All right? 4 MR. SALYER: Yes, Your Honor. 5 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the -- the attorney 6 says, in my opinion, I want this tried before a judge 7 because I think I'll get a fairer shake. Okay. 8 Illegal; right? 9 MR. SALYER: Are you making the distinction, 10 Your Honor, between -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you just said 12 anything that waives the right to a jury is illegal 13 unless it's explicitly there. So, that's case one. 14 Case two, similar kind of argument, and the 15 lawyers for the two parties get together and say, we'd 16 like to settle this case. Illegal; right? No power, 17 they can't do it in Kentucky. Can't settle cases. 18 Can't have traces -- cases tried before a judge. Is 19 that right? 20 MR. SALYER: No, Your Honor. That -21 that -22 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's not right. Oh, 23 I see. In other words, you -- you -- you -- why -- why 24 isn't it right? Because after all, the fundamental 25 right of trial by jury is being -- you're giving the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 attorney the power to refuse to have a jury.

22

2 MR. SALYER: Well, Your Honor --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: So what's the difference

4 between that and the case we have, where we're not going

5 to have a mediator, we're not going to have settlement,

6 we're not going to have a judge trial, we're going to

7 have an arbitrator.

8 MR. SALYER: Your Honor, the -- the

9 interpretive rule that the Kentucky Supreme Court

10 enunciated was the power to waive generally fundamental

11 constitutional rights. The -- the idea that -- that

12 the -- the person is going to waive their jury rights

13 in -- in general from now on --

14 JUSTICE BREYER: All he did was say that in

15 the attorney's judgment, if he wants to go to

16 arbitration and thinks that's best, he can do it. Now,

17 I just don't see the difference between that and

18 implying, in the attorney's judgment, if he wants to

19 settle a case, rather than going to a jury, he can do

20 it. Or, if in the attorney's judgment, he would like a

21 case tried before a judge instead of a jury, he can do

22 it. And you're going to tell me that that's ridiculous

23 to think that a general power of attorney would give the

24 attorney the right to say, no jury, judge trial. No

25 jury, mediator. Oh, but it makes perfect sense to say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 no jury, arbitrary -- arbitrator.

23

2 Now, if you're not going to tell me that

3 those are treated exactly alike, I will tell you in my

4 opinion right now you have discriminated against

5 arbitration --

6 MR. SALYER: Well, Your Honor --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Unless you can find some

8 difference.

9 MR. SALYER: It seems to me that the

10 analogue to what you're -- you're proposing would be an

11 instance where the -- the attorney engaged with another

12 party never to have a jury trial with that party

13 pre-dispute just for a -- for from now on. Or that

14 they're always going to go to mediation and never go

15 to --

16 JUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't this. You

17 say that a attorney -- I'll be repeating myself. I'm

18 testing out whether it's really true. Of course I'm

19 highly suspicious as you can tell from my tone of voice.

20 What I really think has happened is that Kentucky just

21 doesn't like the Federal law. That's what I suspect.

22 So they're not going to follow it. Now, that, of

23 course, you're going to say, no, they would never do

24 that. So I'm trying to test this out. And that's why I

25 asked my question. Because it seems to me that

2 dispute, mediation as a means of settling a dispute, a

3 judge as a means of settling a dispute, are equally and

4 no different in the respect that none of those three

5 involves a trial by jury.

6 So I just want to know -- and you have

7 already said, no, no, they're all different. Well, that

8 to me proves that they're treating arbitration

9 specially. So I put my whole argument there because I

10 want you to have an opportunity to reply.

11 MR. SALYER: Thank you, Your Honor.

12 I -- I think that the -- the -- the

13 distinction that -- that would be made there is that

14 we're -- we're talking about an agreement that's

15 pre-dispute and waives a -- this particular right

16 vis-à-vis the nursing home resident and the nursing home

17 potentially in perpetuity.

18 And I guess the analogue to -- to a --

19 coming to an agreement to settle pre-dispute would be a

20 liquidated damages clause. And I think that the -- that

21 the Kentucky Supreme Court probably would not look very

22 favorably on an attorney-in-fact executing a liquidated

23 damages clause with a nursing home to settle any

24 potential personal injury that occurred at -- during the

25 nursing home resident's stay.

25 1 But I -- I actually want to get to -- to, if 2 I could, to a more overarching point in -- in this case; 3 and that is, the Federal Arbitration Act does not extend 4 this Court's powers of interpretation beyond agreements 5 to arbitrate. Moreover, DIRECTV was the exception that 6 proved the rule, and the rule applies here. Excuse me. 7 This Court does not ordinarily instruct 8 States in how to interpret the instruments and documents 9 that are governed by State law. Now -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And maybe I missed 11 your -- missed your point. The FAA does not extend 12 beyond what? 13 MR. SALYER: Agreements to -- beyond 14 agreements to arbitrate and -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Interpret -16 interpreting them or anything with respect to them? For 17 example, you're not arguing that if Kentucky had a law 18 saying you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that 19 would certainly be covered by the FAA. 20 MR. SALYER: Yes, Your Honor, that -21 that -- well, we believe, would be covered by the FAA. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- and if that 23 was a decision of a court that said, under our common 24 law you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that would 25 also?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
26 1 MR. SALYER: Totally not. That's what the 2 Federal Arbitration Act is directly directed at. 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, since we're 4 talking about laws that have an impact on agreements to 5 arbitrate, I guess I don't understand the effect of your 6 principle. 7 MR. SALYER: Well, we're looking at the 8 black letter of Section 2, which provides that 9 agreements to arbitrate shall be valid, irrevocable, and 10 enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist for the 11 revocation of any contract. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 13 MR. SALYER: That pertains specifically to 14 arbitration agreements. And so what do we have here? 15 We have an absence of authority of the signator to this 16 arbitration agreement. That certainly should qualify as 17 a -- a ground for revocation of any contract, absence of 18 authority. 19 So that is as far as the Federal Arbitration 20 Act extends. It extends to the enforcement of formed, 21 existing arbitration agreements. It doesn't bootstrap 22 them into place by -- Section 2 creates substantive 23 contract rights, certainly. The presumption of 24 arbitrability in certain instances, the preemption of 25 State law in certain instances. What it does not create
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 are other kinds of rights, such as the right -- the

27

2 entitlement to the creation of agency in someone else's

3 agency instrument.

4 Have I answered --

5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and your reasoning,

6 I take it, that Kentucky could adopt a law that says

7 agents lack authority to enter into arbitration on

8 behalf of the principal.

9 MR. SALYER: Well, technically, Your Honor,

10 that's correct. However, this Court would not have to

11 go that far in this particular case, because again, what

12 we're talking about is interpreting a power of attorney.

13 And if you -- if you take a look at -- let's

14 use a comparison, the -- the spectrum of Volt on one end

15 and DIRECTV on the other end. We have instances where

16 this Court in Volt said that ordinarily, issues of State

17 contract law interpretation are for the States. And it

18 accepted the -- the lower California court's

19 interpretation of that -- that particular California

20 contract, even though it -- it meant that there was not

21 going to be an arbitration. On the other hand, in

22 DIRECTV, the opposite occurred.

23 And now what's really the difference there?

24 The difference there is where the decision maker has

25 effectively abandoned its interpretive role. In

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 DIRECTV, one could certainly say that the California

28

2 Appellate Court in that case had abandoned its

3 interpretive role and rather imposed its own policy

4 interests and -- and predilections on that -- that

5 contract.

6 To use another example -- now, this is

7 slightly different because it would fall under the

8 10(b)4 deference standards -- but the difference between

9 Stolt-Nielson on the one hand and Oxford Health on the

10 other. You have an instance where an arbitrator simply

11 imposed a policy decision on its quote-unquote

12 "interpretation of the contract," and in which case the

13 arbitrator had gone outside of his express powers under

14 that contract, and Oxford Health, where, even though

15 there was some suspicion that the arbitrator had gotten

16 his or her interpretation of the agreement wrong,

17 nonetheless, that arbitrator was attempting to interpret

18 that arbitration contract, and this Court respected

19 that.

20 Now, again, I understand that that was under

21 the 10(b)4 analysis. But if you look in this case,

22 Clark refers to all contracts. And I think my friend,

23 Mr. Pincus, is probably relying on a literal

24 interpretation, well, all contracts means -- means all

25 contracts. But we must recall that in Volt v. Leland

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 Stanford, what we had was also a potential literal

29

2 interpretation, the Law of the place. The law of the

3 place, in that instance, the place being California,

4 well, what is the literal law of that place? That

5 law -- the law of that place is the law of the State of

6 California and Federal law.

7 But the California court had determined that

8 the local understanding of the local usage of that

9 phrase -- phrase, "law of the place," actually just

10 referred to California State law.

11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I talk about --

12 focus a little bit on -- on Wellner. What is your

13 response to Mr. Pincus's argument that personal property

14 does include arbitration because choses in action are

15 personal property?

16 MR. SALYER: Well, the -- my response to

17 that, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the

18 Kentucky Supreme Court certainly engaged in trying to

19 understand the intentions of the words that the

20 principals meant. And it simply said that a

21 principal -- no principal who grants the power to their

22 son, their daughter, their -- their spouse, their --

23 their attorney-in-fact to buy and sell property or

24 engage in contracts involving property would ever think

25 about -- would allow that -- that attorney-in-fact to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 engage -- engage in one of these arbitration agreements. 2 In that -- in the earlier case regarding 3 powers of attorney in Kentucky -- and that was -- I 4 believe it's U.S. Guarantee & Trust. It's an older 5 case, from -- from 1912. The -- there's language to the 6 effect of giving the power for an agent to buy or sell 7 property does not intrinsically give that person the -8 the power to mortgage property, although one could say 9 that that should naturally flow from -- from the -- the 10 overarching language. So that's the -- the sort of 11 backdrop and context in which the Kentucky Supreme Court 12 is operating. 13 If I could turn for a second to DIRECTV, 14 which is a -- obviously relied upon, to a large extent, 15 by Kindred. In that particular case, I think that this 16 Court reiterated its basic assumption that ordinarily, 17 what a State instrument means is a question for State 18 law in the State courts. And only in exceptional 19 circumstances will this Court engage in a preemption, 20 and in essence, an independent review and 21 reinterpretation of that State instrument. 22 And in DIRECTV, the two similar points that 23 seem to -- to stand out are that that California 24 Appellate Court singled out arbitration, singled out the 25 Federal Arbitration Act for not incorporating Federal
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
31 1 Arbitration Act preemption into the way they read their 2 California contract, the DIRECTV contract. And they did 3 so without attempting to tie that effectively to what 4 the parties might intend in the DIRECTV contract. 5 Here, we do not have that. We have the 6 Kentucky Supreme Court announcing an interpretive rule 7 that -- and it may be difficult for them to -- to work 8 it out over -- over time, but again, that's the way the 9 common law develops, that if you have a general waiver 10 of a fundamental constitutional right by a power of 11 attorney, that has to be spelled out in the document. 12 JUSTICE BREYER: We give the power of 13 attorney to manage my patent, general. A lot of 14 litigation. The other side comes in and says, okay, 15 we'll settle. I'd like you to sign this paper, and this 16 says what you will say and what you won't say about my 17 patent. Absolutely normal. What you will say about 18 your patent, what you won't say about it in certain 19 areas. Can't do that in Kentucky, huh? Free speech. 20 Free speech. 21 MR. SALYER: Your Honor, Mr. Justice Breyer, 22 I think that's correct. 23 JUSTICE BREYER: Can't -- can't give a 24 power -- general power of attorney that will allow a 25 person to settle a patent case on perfectly ordinary

1 terms.

32

2 MR. SALYER: Well, it doesn't make a

3 difference --

4 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any case that

5 suggests that -- except this case, which happens to deal

6 with arbitration.

7 MR. SALYER: Well, it does have to --

8 JUSTICE BREYER: You see, I don't know how

9 to -- the part I don't know how to deal with your

10 argument is, is you say every time I think of examples

11 that would be very weird, which is what I'm trying to

12 do, then -- then you say, oh, well, yeah, that's right.

13 You can't do that anymore in Kentucky. And every time

14 you say that, the law of Kentucky in terms of attorneys,

15 powers of attorney is getting more and more peculiar.

16 That's why I suspect something is going to happen there.

17 So what should I -- what do you think?

18 MR. SALYER: Well, Your Honor, I think that

19 the interpretive rule is -- is rather explicit.

20 JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now we say that you

21 cannot enter into a power of attorney giving the power

22 of attorney the power to enter into normal patent

23 settlements.

24 MR. SALYER: To --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about business

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 settlements? What about business settlements where, you 2 know, there is a perfectly normal thing where a person 3 agrees not to compete, and in agreeing not to compete, 4 you're agreeing not to go to certain places? 5 MR. SALYER: Well -6 JUSTICE BREYER: For that business anyway, a 7 lot of constitutional rights that might infringe. It 8 might if you didn't waive it. I don't know. 9 MR. SALYER: Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, 10 that -- again, that's a -- that's a question of what 11 constitutes a fundamental -- constitute -12 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. 13 MR. SALYER: -- fundamental constitutional 14 right. Now -15 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say about the 16 competing product? 17 MR. SALYER: Right. That would, in fact, be 18 a infringement on the principal's free speech. Indeed, 19 in instances where there are settlements in personal 20 injury actions, often there are non-disparagement 21 clauses. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: Right, right. And, by the 23 way, he makes a product, you know, the person who's 24 given the power of attorney. And as part of the 25 disagreement, the attorney -- a disagreement with OSHA.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 He agrees that OSHA can come in and inspect his plant at 2 various hours of the day or night. That kind of power 3 of attorney would be illegal also in Kentucky. I mean, 4 is there any State that makes that kind of power of 5 attorney illegal or requires it to be explicit somehow 6 that you could settle an ordinary OSHA case, you could 7 settle an ordinary competition case, you could settle an 8 ordinary, you know, patent case on fairly ordinary 9 terms, and it says when you give a power of attorney to 10 do that, you have to be explicit? Is there any State 11 other than Kentucky in this opinion that has ever held 12 such a thing? Maybe there is. 13 MR. SALYER: Well, Your Honor, if I could 14 use a -- a comparative example from the -- the UCC, we 15 know that in ongoing transactions between commercial 16 parties under the UCC, whether a -- a contract clause is 17 incorporated into the contract, if and when it is 18 incorporated, may turn on whether or not that clause is 19 considered material. 20 Now, whether or not it's -- it's considered 21 material is a question of State law. And as -- as I 22 understand, they -- that has never been challenged at -23 that -- some instances, that would -- that will, in 24 fact, cause arbitration clauses not to be incorporated 25 in contracts and not be enforceable because they're
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 considered material and they haven't been negotiated

35

2 properly.

3 What -- what constitutes a fundamental

4 constitutional right is, of course, an -- an open

5 question, but it does seem that certain things such as

6 speech, marriage, religious rights, those sorts of

7 things cannot be dealt with on a permanent basis

8 vis-à-vis another party by an agent without the

9 principal explicitly authorizing them to do so.

10 Furthermore, what the principal has

11 explicitly authorized the agent to do so is an

12 interpretive question regarding this -- this instrument.

13 And just as a -- with a State statute, what a State

14 statute means is a question for the State supreme court.

15 What the principals meant was encompassed within these

16 powers of attorney. Ultimately, someone has to

17 determine what that is. And I posit that that -- that

18 should be the State's supreme court.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the

20 principle that making an arbitration agreement harder to

21 form than other agreements violates the Federal

22 Arbitration Act. As Mr. Pincus mentioned, the main rule

23 is equal footing. Arbitration we thought to be on the

24 same footing as all other contracts. If you make the

25 arbitration agreement harder to form because you have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 have this explicit reference than other contracts,

36

2 doesn't that discriminate against arbitration

3 agreements?

4 MR. SALYER: Perhaps it does, Your Honor.

5 But, again, our -- our position is that the Federal

6 Arbitration Act does not extend beyond agreements to

7 arbitrate, such that in the -- the instance of the --

8 the UCC example that I just used where a State decision

9 as to whether or not arbitration clauses are considered

10 material might make that -- might make it harder to form

11 the arbitration agreement as part of the larger

12 commercial contract. We believe that the Federal

13 Arbitration does not speak to that.

14 However, there are, on the other hand,

15 instances where if a State specifically singles out

16 arbitration to make it more difficult to form, we

17 believe that the formation -- that the FAA would have

18 something to say along those lines. And the -- the

19 example I would like to use in that instance is the

20 facts of Casarotto, if -- if they were slightly

21 different.

22 If the Montana statute hadn't used the

23 language in its subsection that unless the arbitration

24 clause is in -- you know, on the first page in bold

25 letters, then that particular clause is unenforceable.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 If they -- if that statute had simply said, we do not 2 recognize the formation of an agreement to arbitrate 3 unless these hoops are -- are jumped through, that, we 4 believe, would be addressed by the Federal Arbitration 5 Act because it's not really a formation issue. It's 6 really an enforceability issue, relieving the parties to 7 the contract in Casarotto of the responsibility for what 8 they voluntarily signed in which there was a clear 9 meaning. 10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you say you're 11 distinguishing formation from enforcement, but we have 12 two separate agreements that both been formed the power 13 of attorney that's been concluded, the agent has signed 14 the arbitration agreement. So it's not a question of 15 the formation of those agreements; it's what -- what 16 they mean, what is the proper interpretation of the 17 power of attorney. 18 MR. SALYER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. That -19 that's correct inasmuch as -- the question here revolves 20 around what the power of attorney means. If the power 21 of attorney encompassed the authority for the agent to 22 sign this agreement, then, as the Kentucky Supreme Court 23 said, the agreement will be enforced. If it doesn't, 24 then there's no agreement. And I'm saying -- saying 25 that the Federal Arbitration Act does not bear upon
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 answering that question; that that is a function of

38

2 State law and of the State court's interpretation of a

3 power of attorney instrument.

4 So in summation, our -- our general --

5 our -- our general position is that the Federal

6 Arbitration Act again does not extend this Court's

7 interpretive powers beyond agreements to arbitrate. It

8 does not extend them to powers of attorney. However,

9 this Court need not even reach out to that particular

10 principle because we are talking about interpreting a

11 power of attorney, which, in the ordinary course of a

12 State instrument, is up to the State supreme court to --

13 to -- to make that interpretation. And this Court will

14 only step in and substitute its interpretation for that

15 of the State supreme court in the exceptional

16 circumstances.

17 And the only exceptional circumstances that

18 this Court has identified in DIRECTV do not apply here.

19 The Kentucky Supreme Court did not single out

20 arbitration for distinctive treatment, and the Kentucky

21 Supreme Court went out of its way to tie the -- its

22 interpretation of the meaning and authority of the power

23 of attorney to the intention of the principal.

24 No further questions.

25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 Mr. Pincus, you have ten minutes. 2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 3 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 4 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 5 Just a couple of quick points. 6 With respect to the -- the question about 7 whether the FAA is limited to arbitration agreements, I 8 think it's important to note that the text of the FAA 9 says that arbitration agreements shall be valid 10 irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as 11 exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any 12 contract. 13 So it's true the focus of the FAA is on 14 whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable or not, 15 but there's nothing in the FAA that prohibits its 16 application to an antecedent agreement if that 17 antecedent agreement prohibits the enforcement of the 18 arbitration agreement on a ground that's specific to 19 arbitration. 20 And I think that's not only true of the text 21 of the statutes; it's true because the implications of 22 that rule would be quite dramatic. For example, a State 23 could just enact a statute that says a power of attorney 24 can never be interpreted to confer the ability to enter 25 into an arbitration agreement either at all, which my
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 friend, I think, acknowledged would -- would be

40

2 problematic under the FAA or could impose all kinds of

3 special requirements. It has to be notarized. There

4 have to be warnings about the dangers of arbitration.

5 And surely --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, the State could

7 also --

8 MR. PINCUS: -- that would --

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State could also

10 enact a statute that says powers of attorney can't

11 waive -- can't waive fundamental rights. Would -- would

12 that violate the FAA, in your view?

13 MR. PINCUS: I -- I think it would present a

14 more difficult question than this case. And let me

15 explain why and then let me answer your -- your

16 question, Mr. Chief Justice.

17 I think as -- as some of Justice Breyer's

18 questions indicated, the rule here doesn't, in fact,

19 embody that principle because it is both -- it -- it is

20 underinclusive in two respects. It doesn't even affect

21 all jury waivers because --

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. But I mean,

23 legislators -- legislatures often pass statutes that are

24 underinclusive or overinclusive. So I don't think that

25 distinguishes the case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think the question 2 would be just how inclusive is it. If -- if it's 3 interpreted -- if it is the same kind of -4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It -- it says it 5 embodies the rule that the supreme -- Kentucky Supreme 6 Court adopted, which is that you can't -- you can't 7 waive fundamental rights, and like a lot of statutes, 8 it's going to require some interpretation. But that's 9 all it says. It says, you can't -- you know, they're 10 worried about the scope of powers of attorney, and they 11 say powers of attorney in Kentucky cannot waive 12 fundamental rights under the Constitution. 13 MR. PINCUS: And -- and I -- I -- I think 14 our answer to that question would be -- although the 15 Court doesn't have to reach it here -- that lumping 16 arbitration agreements into that category of fundamental 17 rights is a judgment that the FAA precludes the State 18 from making because the judgment -19 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that -- that suggests 20 that the arbitration is a preferred right, and I thought 21 that the idea of the FAA was to say it can't be -22 whatever, dis-preferred, un-preferred, you know -- but 23 not to put it on its own separate plane, like you can't 24 deal with this in the same way that you could deal with 25 any other fundamental right.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
42 1 MR. PINCUS: Well, that's why I say it would 2 be a harder question, Your Honor, but -- but I think 3 the -- the critical thing is here, it's quite clear from 4 the State court's own opinion that that isn't the rule 5 of decision here because the State court, as the dissent 6 points out, the -- the express authorization requirement 7 doesn't apply to jury waivers in a host of different 8 circumstances, as Justice Breyer's opinions pointed out, 9 and it also doesn't apply to lots of fundamental -10 other kinds of fundamental rights. 11 JUSTICE KAGAN: But how do we really know? 12 Are -- are you saying that a court can never announce a 13 generally applicable rule first in an arbitration case? 14 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think it -- it 15 certainly is something that should raise a lot of 16 suspicion. Can it never -- I would never want to say 17 never, but I do think that this aspect of the case 18 presents a -- a more compelling argument for application 19 of the FAA than Imburgia. 20 In Imburgia, the threshold question for the 21 court was, does the California State courts' 22 interpretation of the phrase "law of your State" 23 actually discriminate against -- single out arbitration? 24 There's no doubt that this rule is singling out 25 arbitration. If that's what the court --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
43 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose -- well, suppose -2 MR. PINCUS: -- expressly says, the question 3 is how broad is it singling out. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't single 5 out arbitration. That happens to be the issue before 6 it. I mean, basically, it seems to me what it's coming 7 down to is you just don't believe the Kentucky Supreme 8 Court when it says this is the general principle. And 9 you're saying, well, I really think you're hostile to 10 arbitration because I haven't heard that principle 11 before and this is the first one. But you know, if -12 if the Kentucky legislature passes a law that does the 13 same thing, I mean, are you going to be suspicious of 14 them too just because arbitration might be the first 15 time it comes up? 16 MR. PINCUS: I -- I think it -- it depends 17 on the circumstances and it depends on -- on how 18 badly -19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose -- suppose we send 20 this back and we say we don't really believe you. We 21 think you're being hostile to arbitration, and they say, 22 well, prove it. And in five cases involving other 23 fundamental rights they do what Justice Breyer suggests 24 that they don't really have any intention of doing, but 25 they really do it. They say no, we're -- we're really
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
44 1 serious about this. We think powers of attorney are -2 are -- are special things and we have to impose special 3 protections. And then it comes up here, you know, the 4 sixth time. They say, and arbitration too. 5 What do we do then? 6 MR. PINCUS: Well, I -- I guess a couple of 7 things. First of all, I -- I do think the Court has to 8 make a judgment, as it did in Imburgia, based on what's 9 before it at the time. And what's before the Court at 10 this time is a rule created in the context of 11 arbitration -12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I know, but I want -13 MR. PINCUS: -- premised on -14 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what I want to hear you 15 talk about, usually we don't presume that State courts 16 are acting in ways that are not in accordance with law. 17 Actually, we usually give them the benefit of a kind of 18 good faith presumption. 19 So if you're saying, well, no, they have to 20 prove it first in five other cases before we'll believe 21 them that they really do mean all constitutional rights, 22 that seems, you know, an unusual rule to apply to State 23 supreme courts who we usually think are acting in good 24 faith and in accordance with law. 25 MR. PINCUS: Well, I don't -- I don't know
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
45 1 that they have to prove it. I think this Court has to 2 look at the objective indicia, as it did in Imburgia, as 3 it's done in other cases, to see what -- what is really 4 going on in a case. And I think even the majority below 5 did not -- although it said all fundamental rights, the 6 five instances that it identified were not general, 7 fundamental rights. Free speech, for example, was not 8 one. They are the most -9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -10 MR. PINCUS: -- onerous -- I'm sorry. 11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to look at 12 what's going on in the case. So in my case where you 13 just have a statute, there's nothing else to look at. 14 So how -- how -- I still don't get why that would be 15 invalid. 16 MR. PINCUS: I -- I think the question in 17 that case would not be whether it's going to be applied 18 to the category of fundamental rights. The question in 19 that case would be does the FAA permit a State to make a 20 judgment that contracts with respect to arbitration 21 should be lumped in -22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no talk 23 about arbitration. The word "arbitration" -24 MR. PINCUS: No, I understand -25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- doesn't come up.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
46 1 MR. PINCUS: -- but -- but there still is a 2 question, I think. What the FAA -- at bottom, what the 3 FAA said to -- was reacting to was State courts saying 4 arbitration is especially onerous and troublesome and 5 we're going to require -- we're going to require special 6 processes if we -7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We understand that. 8 But I'm talking about a legislative proposition. And it 9 doesn't say anything about arbitration. It just says 10 powers of attorney. You can't waive fundamental rights 11 unless it's expressly stated. 12 MR. PINCUS: I -- I think it would be a much 13 harder case. I don't know -14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but 15 the problem is -- is that it is, in terms of the 16 law-making authority, Kentucky would say to the supreme 17 court, you know, we make these rules through the courts 18 as we did in this case. And I just -- I guess I just 19 don't see -- I -- I don't think you've -- well, you 20 haven't come up with a distinction that persuades me, 21 and that's important because I think, as Justice Kagan 22 said, we have to assume the Kentucky Supreme Court is 23 acting in good faith. 24 JUSTICE BREYER: So isn't it that -- that 25 your answer is there's nothing wrong with that statute?

47 1 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think -- I think -2 JUSTICE BREYER: And that, in fact, what the 3 statutes does, whether it covers arbitration or not, if 4 a court holds that it does cover arbitration, you have 5 to look to see whether the other things in there are 6 like arbitration sufficiently or there are other things 7 that aren't covered that are like arbitration 8 sufficiently, so that you could, at the end, draw a 9 conclusion that this is or is not discriminatory. 10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's nothing else 11 in there. The -- the first time -12 MR. PINCUS: That's exactly -13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The first time the 14 statute is applied, it happens to be to an arbitration 15 case. It happens to be to this case. But you can't say 16 oh, look in the background of it. It's all about 17 hostility to arbitration. You can't -18 MR. PINCUS: Well, I -- I -- I guess two 19 answers. Just to return to this case for a minute, I -20 I don't think that's the rule that's being applied. I 21 think it's clear, because the instances of fundamental 22 rights that were identified were one part -23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Pincus, you 24 understand that when your first answer is, let's go to 25 this case, that's not the most compelling response.

48 1 MR. PINCUS: I understand, Your Honor, 2 but -- but I -- I -- and to answer the question more 3 broadly, I -- I do think there's a -- there's a question 4 that the Court would have to answer in that 5 circumstance, whether, as Justice Breyer put it more 6 eloquently than I did, that the -- that arbitration is 7 being included in that category not because of some 8 special characteristic of arbitration, but because 9 arbitration agreements have the same characteristics as 10 all of those other things -11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well, 12 how would you do that? That's the position that you and 13 maybe Justice Breyer are taking. How would you -- how 14 would you go about that? How would you say we've got to 15 decide why arbitration is being included in this? 16 MR. PINCUS: Well, and -- I would say, as an 17 advocate at least, that the problem with that judgment 18 is that what Congress said in the FAA is, in fact, you 19 can't say that arbitration agreements should be treated 20 like some special category of contracts just because of 21 a characteristic of arbitration. There has to be 22 another reason. And what the State is doing there is 23 saying arbitration is especially significant because of 24 a -- of a characteristic. It waives the jury right that 25 is intrinsic to arbitration, and I think that conflicts

1 with the Federal policy.

49

2 So, yes, the State could say that with all

3 fundamental rights. My argument would be it can't do

4 that with respect to arbitration and -- and I might

5 lose.

6 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- so the -- as I -- as

7 I understand the question better, one, of course the

8 legislature could enact such a statute.

9 Two, if we have our first case arbitration

10 and they say arbitration is included among it, then what

11 we're job is is to read the opinion.

12 Now, sometimes courts don't write enough in

13 the opinion for us to make the decision as to whether or

14 not it is being discriminated against, in which case we

15 send it back and ask them to write more. So is that

16 what we should do?

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes or no, and your

18 time is expired.

19 MR. PINCUS: No.

20 (Laughter.)

21 MR. PINCUS: I think you have enough here.

22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Thank you. You

23 can answer it.

24 MR. PINCUS: I -- I think the answer is no

25 because I -- I think there's enough in this opinion.

1 I -- I think for the reasons indicated in Justice

2 Breyer's question, the -- the category here doesn't

3 apply to all jury waivers. So the argument that it

4 applies even to the waiver of a jury right is not true,

5 and it doesn't apply to all fundamental rights. The

6 examples that were given are the most onerous kind --

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: He cheated --

8 MR. PINCUS: -- of contracts you can

9 imagine.

10 (Laughter.)

11 MR. PINCUS: Sorry.

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
