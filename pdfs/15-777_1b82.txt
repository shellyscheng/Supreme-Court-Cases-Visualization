3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:05 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case No. 15-777, Samsung 5 Electronics v. Apple, Incorporated. 6 Ms. Sullivan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 A smartphone is smart because it contains 12 hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it 13 work. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of 14 the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design 15 patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to 16 total profit on the entire phone. 17 That result makes no sense. A single design 18 patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone 19 should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the 20 profit on the entire phone. 21 Section 289 does not require that result, 22 and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, 23 Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does 24 not require that result. We respectfully ask that the 25 Court hold that when a design patent claims a design
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
4 1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a component 2 of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, 3 when a design patent is applied to an article of 4 manufacture within a multi-article product, we request 5 that you hold that Section 289 entitles the 6 patent-holder to total profit on the article of 7 manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and 8 not the profits on the total product. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how to 10 instruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not the 11 government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, 12 oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simply 13 wouldn't know what to do under your -- under your test. 14 My preference, if -- if I were just making 15 another sensible rule, is we'd have market studies to 16 see how the -- the extent to which the design affected 17 the consumer, and then the jury would have something to 18 do that. But that's apportionment, which runs headlong 19 into the statute. 20 You can't really have apportionment, so it 21 seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to 22 have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example 23 that's in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is 24 a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and 25 just follow the words of the statute. But it seems to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.

5

2 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it's one

4 thing to leave it to the jury. It's the other thing --

5 if I were the juror, I wouldn't know what to do under

6 your brief.

7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose

8 a test that simply leaves it to the jury without

9 guidance. The instruction we proposed and that was

10 rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief

11 at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that

12 the article of manufacture to which a design has been

13 applied is the part or portion of the product as sold

14 that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the

15 patent.

16 So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very

17 simple.

18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I'm the juror, I just

19 don't know what to do. I'd have the iPhone in the jury

20 room; I'd -- I'd look at it. I just wouldn't know.

21 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we

22 respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the

23 test for what constitutes an article of manufacture.

24 And to be clear, I'm now stressing our

25 article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 argument we gave as an alternative.

6

2 As the case comes to the Court, all we ask

3 is that you rule in favor of us on article of

4 manufacture.

5 And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us

6 what to look at --

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make

8 sure I understand that, that in other words, you're --

9 you're saying we should only look to what an article of

10 manufacture is and not your other argument that there

11 should be apportionment as to any particular article of

12 manufacture.

13 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.

14 We're pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the

15 case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit

16 must be profit derived from the article of manufacture

17 to which the design has been applied.

18 And, Your Honor, the statute does support

19 our test because the statute asks us to look at the

20 article of manufacture to which the design has been

21 applied.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in

23 this -- in this case?

24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it

25 is -- there are three patents. The D'677 is on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-cornered 2 front face of a phone. 3 In the D'087, it's also the rectangular, 4 round-cornered front face of the phone with certain 5 aspect ratio and corner radii. 6 In the D'305, it is the display screen on 7 which the graphical user interface appears. 8 So, to answer Justice Kennedy's question, 9 the jury should have been instructed either with our 10 instruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to the 11 jury, I'm giving you guidance. There's an article of 12 manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire 13 phone. The article of manufacture may be a part or 14 portion of the phone, and you should look at two things, 15 Your Honor. 16 You should look at the patent, and, Justice 17 Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn't just look at 18 the -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought to 19 look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent 20 is going to be the best guide to what the design is 21 applied to in many, many cases, as in this case. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seem 23 to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of 24 law, you were right. And I don't see that as a matter 25 of law.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
8 1 I believe that your basic argument, everyone 2 is in agreement, that the test is an article of 3 manufacture for purposes of sale. 4 But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how 5 do we announce the right test for that? Because the 6 phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer 7 as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That 8 might be what drives the sale. I don't know. 9 Certainly your expert didn't tell me how to 10 figure out the component part. I don't know where in 11 the record you would have enough to survive your 12 argument. 13 MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me back 14 up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence. 15 The -- the test -- and I want to agree with 16 Your Honor. To be clear, we say that what the Federal 17 Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrong 18 as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is 19 necessarily the article of manufacture from which you 20 measure total profit. That's wrong as a matter of law, 21 but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to 22 hold we're right on the article as a matter of law. 23 It's an -- it's a -- it's a question of 24 either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel 25 question of law and fact.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
9 1 And why does it involve both? Because we 2 know that district courts look at patents. You assign 3 them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. And 4 when they look at a patent for a claim construction, 5 we're asking for part of the test to be very similar. 6 The district court can look at the patent 7 and say, oh, this is Apple's front face patent. This 8 isn't one of Apple's 13 other patents on other parts of 9 the phone, or Apple's other patent on the design of the 10 entire case. This is the front face patent. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how would 12 you determine the profit attributable to the relevant 13 article of manufacture? 14 MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor. 15 First, through ordinary accounting that 16 would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to 17 revenues for the relevant component. 18 You could look, if -- if a company buys the 19 component from an original equipment manufacturer, you 20 would look to their profit margins and apply that. 21 If, as sometimes happens within a company, 22 one division makes the glass front face and another 23 division makes the innards of the phone, you would find 24 out the transfer pricing between the divisions. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on 2 the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the 3 face, then it's a 10:1 ratio. 4 MS. SULLIVAN: That's absolutely right, Your 5 Honor. Apple didn't -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you'd have expert 7 testimony on all of that. 8 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would. 9 And you would -- but that's just one way. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you had 11 a case where it's a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let's -13 let's assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of 14 the briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle 15 design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of 16 genius and it identified the car. Then it seems to me 17 that that's quite unfair to say, well, we give three 18 days' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop 19 the motor. 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here's what 21 we would do with the Beetle. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's what -- it 23 seems to me that that's what you would be arguing. 24 MS. SULLIVAN: It's not, Your Honor. To 25 answer Justice Ginsburg's question, there are three ways
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the 2 total profit from the relevant article of manufactures 3 here, the front face, or the display screen. One could 4 have been accounting. One could have been consumer 5 demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. 6 Apple could have said well, people really like the front 7 face disproportionately to all the other parts of the 8 phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence 9 to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or 10 indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your 11 Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total 12 profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be 13 a substantial part of the total profit on the product. 14 Let's take the Beetle, or let's take a cool, 15 shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. 16 It may be that the article of manufacture to which the 17 design patent is applied is just the exterior body of 18 the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay 19 much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. 20 They want to pay for the cool way it looks. 21 If that's so, it should be open to the 22 patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come 23 from the exterior of the car. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference in 25 practical terms between that and your causation argument
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 or apportionment?

12

2 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.

3 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?

4 MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede

5 under article of manufacture that the holder of the

6 patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit

7 does not come entirely from the design.

8 Let me give you an example with a phone's

9 front face. Consumers may value the front face because

10 it's scratch-resistant, because it's water-resistant,

11 because it's shatterproof. We're going to give the

12 patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all

13 the profits for the front face, even if it includes

14 profit from those non-design features of the front face,

15 where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test

16 would limit the profits to the profits from the design

17 parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,

18 that's a little bit overinclusive. We're getting a

19 little more with article of manufacture than we do with

20 a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy

21 for that.

22 But the reason we think it's consistent with

23 Congress's purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress

24 was trying to do was provide a rule that gives

25 design-patent holders total profit from the article of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 manufacture.

13

2 That's a little bit overinclusive, because

3 if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue

4 in the Dobson cases, you'll get a little profit from the

5 design, and there will be a little extra you're getting

6 perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress

7 was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say

8 that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say

9 that design causes value in a single article product

10 like a rug.

11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this

12 record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole

13 phone. If you read the Federal Circuit's decision, they

14 were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --

15 this was their argument to the jury and it sold the

16 Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,

17 that, you know, all smartphones basically function the

18 same. People don't really put much value on the unit.

19 This is what they were arguing, and they put on an

20 expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited

21 them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a

22 properly instructed jury, could you overturn that

23 finding?

24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let's go back to

25 the proper instruction. The jury was not properly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 instructed here.

14

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,

3 Miss Sullivan. I'm asking you --

4 MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If

5 the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental

6 appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on

7 the entire outside of the phone, why didn't they assert

8 it here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone

9 does not look substantially similar to the entire

10 outside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design

11 patencies carve the product up into multiple partial

12 design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement

13 argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which

14 infringement can be found, and it's inappropriate to

15 give total profit when they do that.

16 So, Your Honor, if there had been a design

17 patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple

18 could have tried to get total profit on the entire case.

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're answering

20 "no" to my question. You're saying a properly

21 instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case

22 could not have found for Apple. Is that what --

23 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.

24 That is very much our position.

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 instruction, what was the legal error?

15

2 MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the

3 jury instruction --

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a

5 properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor

6 of Apple on the evidence presented?

7 MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,

8 because --

9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the

10 jury instruction -- 'cause I'm assuming that a proper

11 instruction was given -- what would have been the legal

12 error?

13 MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no

14 reasonable jury could have found on this record that the

15 entire product was the article of manufacture to which

16 the design has been applied. Two reasons.

17 One, design patents cover ornamental

18 appearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the

19 innards of the phone. So the functional innards of the

20 phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design

21 patent.

22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can't claim

23 the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn't cover the

24 innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find

25 its -- could find that the consumers and others would

Official - Subject to Final Review
16 1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks 2 only. 3 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we're talking 4 about design patents, not trademark or copyright. 5 There's no requirement of consumer confusion here on 6 the -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree with 8 you, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answer 10 your question as precisely as I can. Just because you 11 can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle 12 exterior does not mean the car is the article of 13 manufacture. There's two steps here in our test. 14 First, determine what is the article of 15 manufacture. 16 Then second step, determine the quantum of 17 damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that 18 article. 19 Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost 20 all its profits from the exterior case, people were 21 indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail, 22 navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If you 23 could prove that it's a counterfactual that couldn't 24 happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette 25 or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
17 1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of 2 the total product and the profit. That's not this case. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at the 4 trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article 5 less than the whole phone? 6 MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. And 7 we were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the jury 8 instruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began, 9 we submitted a legal brief. It's Docket 1322. We said 10 very clearly article of manufacture is less than the 11 total phone and profit should be limited to the profit 12 from the article. We said again in the jury 13 instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully 14 to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on 15 petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the 16 court and we said please listen to us about article of 17 manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the 18 article. The district court said, no, I already said no 19 apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no 20 apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The 21 district court shut us out of article of manufacture as 22 the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of 23 causation or apportionment, which we don't press here. 24 So that's twice. Our legal brief, our 25 charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again 2 said article is separate from apportionment, and the 3 article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said 4 at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less 5 than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the 6 first trial, we again said article is less than the 7 phone. 8 Second trial happens on certain phones. 9 Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says 10 again, I have ruled that there's no apportionment for 11 design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of 12 manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to 13 get the article of manufacture's theory embraced, and we 14 were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? 15 Because there was evidence in the case from which a 16 reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found 17 that the components were the front face, the front face, 18 and the display screen. And the evidence came out of 19 Apple's own witnesses, which we're certainly entitled to 20 rely on. Your Honor, Apple's own witnesses again and 21 again said what are you claiming. And when the 22 witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn't 23 say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we're 24 claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, 25 ignore the home button. We're claiming a very specific
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
19 1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore 2 everything that's outside the dotted lines. 3 And if I could just remind you that we've 4 reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look 5 like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D'677. They may 6 look like an iPhone in the D'087, which was in 7 Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. 8 The claim is for the small portion of the external 9 appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. 10 Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It 11 disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. 12 And Your Honor, the question for the jury 13 was not did people think that the look and feel of an 14 iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the 15 very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes 16 look substantially similar to the very small portion of 17 the patent claim? 18 Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in 19 this record for a conclusion that the entire product, 20 profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit 21 from those articles. What Apple should have done is 22 done either of the two things we discussed earlier, 23 accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goods 24 sold on the components, or it should have done consumer 25 survey evidence like our expert did.

20 1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General has 2 proposed a test with four factors to determine the 3 article question. Do you agree with those? Are there 4 others you would add? 5 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I'll answer 6 briefly, and then I'd like to reserve my time. 7 We -- we like the Solicitor General's test. 8 We propose a briefer test that we think is more 9 administrable. We propose that you look to two factors: 10 The design in the patent and the accused product. We 11 think our test is more administrable, and it can often 12 be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in 13 Markman, who will then instruct the jury and give them 14 guidance. And I'll be happy to explain further on 15 rebuttal.

FLETCHER 21 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 22 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 24 and may it please the Court: 25 This case presents two related questions
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 about the scope of the remedy that's available for

21

2 design-patent infringement under Section 289. If I

3 understood my friend Ms. Sullivan's presentation

4 correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both

5 of those legal questions.

6 Just to summarize briefly, first, the court

7 of appeals correctly held that Section 289's provision

8 for an award of total profits means that the

9 patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the

10 sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not

11 just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder

12 can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as

13 opposed to other features of the article.

14 But second, we read the court of appeals'

15 opinion to have held that the relevant article of

16 manufacture for which profits are owed is always the

17 entire product that the infringer sells to customers.

18 And we think that's a mistake, and we understand all

19 parties to agree with that now.

20 Instead, the relevant article of manufacture

21 to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes

22 be a part or a component of a larger product sold in

23 commerce. And when that is the case, all parties now

24 agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the

25 profits from that infringing article and not to all --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
22 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when the 2 component -- when the article of manufacture isn't sold 3 apart from the entire product, how should the -- the 4 judge charge the jury on determining the profit 5 attributable to the infringing article? 6 MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there'd be 7 two factual questions in a case where that's disputed. 8 The first one would be what is the relevant article, and 9 there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case. 10 The second question, once the fact-finder 11 identifies the relevant article, is the question that 12 you asked, which is how much of the total profits from 13 the device are attributable to the infringing article? 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the first step, 15 and how do you figure it out? 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he complete 17 his answer to my question? 18 MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on the 19 second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a 20 lot of detail because it hasn't been briefed in this 21 case. This case sort of stopped at the first step. But 22 we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that 23 courts have handled other analogous questions, and I 24 point to two areas of law where that's happened. 25 The first is utility patent damages under
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
23 1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the 2 infringer's profits. And in those cases, very often a 3 patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in 4 commerce, and the fact-finder would say you're entitled 5 to the profits that are attributable to the infringing 6 part, but not the whole machine. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- Justice 8 Ginsburg's question. Is that -- is your answer to her, 9 adequately summarized, the test that you propose at 10 page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include? 11 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test we 12 propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions 13 that I was speaking to, which is what's the article of 14 manufacture to which the design has been applied? Once 15 the fact-finder makes that judgment, that's the test 16 that we proposed, and that's, I think, I took to be 17 Justice Sotomayor's question. 18 I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking 19 once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article 20 is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on 21 the car, how do they separate out the part of the 22 profits that are attributable to that component from the 23 whole. 24 And as to that question, we haven't briefed 25 it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to

24 1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that 2 courts have confronted in other areas of law. One was 3 utility patent damages, as I described. Another one is 4 discussed at some length in this Court's decision in the 5 Sheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a case 6 where the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses be 8 called on in order to show part one or part two or both? 9 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very often 10 both. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would those 12 expert witnesses -- who would they be? What would they 13 say? 14 MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will depend 15 on -- on the circumstances of the case. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case. 17 MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someone 18 familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in 19 the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone 20 company, or someone who is familiar with the market for 21 smartphones and who could speak to on the first question 22 how smartphones are put together, how they are 23 manufactured, how they're used by the users, the extent 24 to which the components of a smartphone are separable. 25 And then on the second question, the one
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
25 1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be 3 speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in 4 your question in the Sullivan, which is things like 5 consumer surveys, to what extent do the various 6 components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and 7 contribute to the value of the phone. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 9 things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. I 10 don't understand how that helps on this question. It 11 would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it 12 contributed to profits. 13 MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits from 16 the bottom up by saying, what's the cost of each of 17 these components, and then what share of the revenue is 18 attributable to each of these components. And then you 19 say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up 21 calculation and try to do it that way. 22 Courts haven't always done that. Sometimes 23 that won't be feasible. Sometimes instead they've -24 they've done a more impressionistic approximation and 25 said the total profits on this product are $10 million,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
26 1 and we think that the component at issue here, based on 2 expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 3 25 percent. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said based 5 on expert testimony. What would -- what would they be 6 talking about? 7 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldon 8 case that's cited on page 27 of our brief from this 9 Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these 10 problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion 11 the portion -- the profits from a movie that are 12 attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or 13 the directors or other things. And they had experts who 14 were familiar with the industry and who said the script 15 is important but, really, a lot of the value and 16 particularly for a movie like this comes from other 17 things. 18 And there were various expert testimonies 19 that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up 20 saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of 21 the total profits from the movie, and this Court 22 affirmed that award and said that's a reasonable 23 approximation. 24 We're not -- never going to be able to get 25 to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions

1 and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable

27

2 approximation is good enough, and it's certainly better

3 than awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able

4 to come to those reasonable approximations by using

5 expert testimony in some of the ways that we've

6 discussed.

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you

8 speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I

9 understand Ms. Sullivan's answer, she said, well, that

10 distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it's

11 just -- it's still -- the article is only the body of

12 the car. And -- and you say, no, there's a real

13 question as to whether it is being -- the design is

14 being applied to the car itself.

15 So how would you go about thinking about

16 that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and

17 under what instructions?

18 MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic

19 question for the fact-finders, what's the article of

20 manufacture to which the design has been applied. We

21 think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court's

22 observation in Gorham. It's 1871, first design patent

23 case that the -- what a design is, is it's the thing

24 that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of

25 manufacture.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
28 1 And the point we're making with the VW Bug 2 example is that in some cases, that's going to be very 3 easy. If the patented design is for a refrigerator 4 latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the 5 distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let's talk about 7 the hard cases. 8 MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases, 9 like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it's either 10 the body or the car. Then we've given the Court four 11 factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the 12 jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those 13 factors. And so we say you should compare the scope of 14 the patented design as shown in the drawings in the 15 patent, how prominently that design features in the 16 accused article, whether there are other conceptually 17 distinct innovations or components in the article that 18 are not part of or associated with the patented design, 19 and finally the physical relationship between the 20 patented design and the rest of the article. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, how 22 would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would 23 you want to hear? 24 MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- as 25 to the article, what's the article --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
29 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn't have given you 2 that second option. 3 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it's a 4 factual question. I do think you'd want to hear from 5 experts who can speak to the question of how is the 6 Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the 7 Beetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetle 9 put together? It's put together like every other car. 10 I mean, I don't see how that's going to tell you whether 11 the shape of the body is distinctive or not. 12 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you'd also want 13 to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that 14 the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, 15 but not the interior of the car. There are design 16 features in the interior that the driver sees that 17 aren't the body of the article. 18 As to the second factor, how prominent is 19 the design feature, I think that's one that cuts in 20 favor of finding that the design does cover the whole 21 article. 22 Then the third one is conceptually distinct 23 innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. 24 There are going to be lots of other features of the car 25 or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering

2 might want to hear adverse testimony.

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the first

4 part of the test.

5 MR. FLETCHER: Correct.

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the article of

7 manufacture.

8 So now take the second part of the test and

9 apply it to the Bug.

10 MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we've

11 decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug

12 is just the body of the Bug.

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.

14 MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is

15 the best way to determine that, at least that I can

16 think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed

17 to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their

18 purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and

19 to what extent are they instead valuing other things

20 like --

21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that

22 question is not relevant to the first question. In

23 other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs

24 buy them because of the look of the car.

25 MR. FLETCHER: Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
31 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that's 2 only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, 3 which is the question of whether it's the body or the 4 whole car that the design is being applied to? 5 MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that's the 6 statute -- the way the statute reads. It says you get 7 profits from the article of manufacture. And so, 8 logically, I think the way to approach it would be 9 identify the article and then let the patent-holder make 10 the argument that even though the article may be just a 11 part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it's just 12 the case of the front face -- really, that's what sells 13 it. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, 14 in a case where it is the design of the article that's 15 selling the whole product, still recover a very 16 substantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is not 20 helpful to me, because I can't get over the thought that 21 nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like 22 the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, 23 $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What 24 if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? 25 What if it broke down every 50 miles?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 So if that is a real question, if it is a 2 real question whether the article of manufacture there 3 is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about 4 the test for determining what is the article of 5 manufacture. 6 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that those 7 things can be taken into account at the second step of 8 the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the 9 relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, 10 but for all of the reasons you just pointed out. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- you 12 were saying it's an open -- it would be a difficult 13 question. You'd have to apply numerous factors to 14 determine what is the article of manufacture there. 15 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think if 16 you're skeptical about that, I think our test for 17 article of manufacture also lets some of those 18 considerations play into that test, because it gets to 19 whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, 20 or other components of the product unrelated to the 21 design. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 MR.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 2 and may it please the Court: 3 Before I address the Court's many questions 4 initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury 5 be instructed under what we and the government believe 6 to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test 7 of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the 8 article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I 9 think it's very clear to address the questions that 10 Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and 11 Ms. Sullivan's response to what actually happened in 12 this case. 13 There is no -- whatever you determine the 14 right instruction should be, there is no basis to 15 overturn the jury's damages verdict in this case. 16 There were two trials below. In neither 17 trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or 18 witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any 19 article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. 20 In both trials, Samsung's expert witness, Mr. Wagner, 21 calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones 22 themselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable juror 23 in these trials could possibly have awarded total 24 profits on anything other than the phones, unless this 25 Court holds --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the 2 district judge limited them? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happened 4 was, we put in our initial papers saying -- there's a 5 pretrial statement that the parties have to file saying, 6 these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were 7 infringed. The phones are the things that were 8 infringed for purposes of sale, and here is what our 9 evidence is on total profits from the phone. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on this 11 point. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question 12 trying to figure out what the standard is. Now, why 13 can't we just ask the lower courts to listen to your 14 arguments and theirs, and work it out? 15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not a 16 difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't think it's 18 difficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it's 21 difficult. In fact, they think it's easy on their side. 22 So if I go through and come to the 23 conclusion, at least, that each side has a good 24 argument, under those circumstances, why don't we focus 25 on the question that is of great importance across
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
35 1 industries and leave the application of that and whether 2 it was properly raised to the lower courts? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this were 4 difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this 5 Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think 6 there is a great need for this Court to do. And we're 7 not suggesting that it wouldn't -- that it isn't 8 necessary for the Court to do it. 9 This is a case very much like global tech, 10 when you found that the lower court had applied the 11 wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then 12 found that the record -- even -- but under the correct 13 higher standard, the record admitted no other 14 conclusion. What's so easy about this case is that they 15 never identified to the jury, in either case, any 16 article of manufacture other than the phone. And all of 17 their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on 18 the total profits to the phone. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I'll 20 read it and I'll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question on 23 the general issue, which I think is tough. And the 24 general question that I have is I have been looking for 25 a standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
36 1 quite close; the parties actually in the government are 2 fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the 3 Internet Association, the software industry. And you 4 know that brief I'm talking about on Facebook and some 5 others. 6 MR. WAXMAN: I do. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did is 8 they went back into history. They have a lot of 9 different cases which they base the standard on, and 10 they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, 11 but that the design where it's been applied to only 12 part -- it's on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product 13 and does not drive demand for the entire product, the 14 article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only 15 the component to which the design applies. And only 16 profit attributable to that component may be awarded. 17 Now, really, to understand it, you have to 18 have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to 19 understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use 20 examples. And so that kind of standard, with perhaps 21 examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, 22 you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on the 23 hood? No, no, no. You don't get all the profit from 24 the car. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --

37 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not? 2 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand your 3 question, and I just want to bookmark the fact that I 4 have not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg's 5 question. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead and 7 answer her question. At some point you can come back to 8 it. 9 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I'll answer Justice 10 Ginsburg first and then Justice Breyer. 11 Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that 12 Samsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened in 13 the Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report, 14 Mr. Wagner's report -- was they -- he was not allowed to 15 present evidence about that -- about the value of design 16 to the total product as a whole. That was 17 apportionment, Judge Koh said. 18 He wanted -- he calculated total profits 19 based on the phone. And his report then said, well, but 20 I believe that only 1 percent of the value of the phone 21 is due to the design or the design of the iconic front 22 face of the phone. And that, she wouldn't allow him to 23 do because that was apportionment. 24 The question -- the only issue with respect 25 to article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in
Alderson Reporting Company

38 1 either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as a 2 matter of law in a multicomponent product, the article 3 of manufacture must be the portion. 4 They never said that to the jury. They did 5 propose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed the 6 jury that that's what it was supposed to do. It also 7 directed the jury to apportion, and the judge didn't 8 approve it. Now, it just so happens that they preserved 9 no relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we're 11 spending an awful lot of time on an issue about what was 12 raised below, what wasn't raised below, what was raised 13 below, what wasn't raised. Maybe it's a good time to 14 turn to Justice Breyer's question. 15 MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to do 16 that. 17 Justice Breyer, the -- there is no question 18 that in an appropriate case the jury can decide whether 19 the article of manufacture to which the design is 20 applied and to which it provides a distinctive and 21 pleasing appearance could either be the article that's 22 actually sold to consumers, that's bought by consumers, 23 or it could be a component of it. 24 In the case of a wall hanging, there's 25 really not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
39 1 there really isn't much dispute. It is a question of 2 fact for the jury. 3 We believe that the -- the four factors that 4 the Solicitor General articulated would be appropriate 5 factors to consider. 6 I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the 8 question of fact? 9 MR. WAXMAN: Here's -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to which 11 the law applies? What -- what is the question of fact? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In a 13 case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing 14 articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should 15 be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find 16 infringement, total profits are awarded on the article 17 of manufacture to which the patented design was applied 18 for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar 19 or distinctive appearance. 20 You may determine that the article of 21 manufacture is the entire product or a distinct 22 component of that product. In making that 23 determination, you may consider, and this would depend 24 on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would 25 include the Solicitor General's, and there may be other

40 1 things. For example, most importantly the identity of 2 what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers. 3 Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers 4 to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 5 patentee's product. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I'm not 7 grasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to me 8 that the design is applied to the exterior case of the 9 phone. It's not applied to the -- all the chips and 10 wires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That's right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That's absolutely right. And, 14 you know, of course you can't get a design patent on 15 something that the consumer can't see. And yet 16 Congress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn't be profits awarded based on the entire 19 price of the phone. 20 MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded on 21 the article of manufacture to which the design is 22 applied. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, the 24 case is part of it. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 think the -- the difficulty here is that it's important 2 to understand that design is not a component and the 3 patented design is not the article of manufacture. The 4 patented design is something that's applied to an 5 article of manufacture. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, 7 these -- these little, the chips and all are articles of 8 manufacture, right? How is the design of the case 9 applied to those chips? 10 MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, if 11 you look at, for example, in the early days, when the 12 patent -- when the design -- when design patents were 13 first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of 15 them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and 16 things like that. Congress -- when Congress said that 17 you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson 18 cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is 19 infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not 20 happen innocently. 21 When there is infringement of a design, the 22 patentee may choose an alternative remedy which is 23 essentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoes 24 of the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge the 25 profits from the article to which the design was

1 applied.

42

2 There's no doubt the steam engine had plenty

3 of working components, but a design is not a component.

4 A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to

5 decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either

6 a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape

7 of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude

8 that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW

9 Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the

10 Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer

11 copied it.

12 The -- we know from Samsung's own documents

13 in this case, for example, that are recounted in our

14 brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this

15 executive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of

16 design was reflected, the documents show, in the

17 telephone company saying, you have to create something

18 like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create

19 something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing

20 sales. And in three months --

WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveat 6 only. What -- the factors that the jury will be told 7 will depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don't go to 9 the -- to the record. 10 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not going to the -- I'm 11 sticking with the test. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That's the 13 test. 14 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let's assume, because 16 it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody 17 else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, 18 are the article of manufacture. 19 Now, the government would say, go to the 20 second test, which takes in some of the things that you 21 were talking about, to figure out how much of the 22 profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to 23 the shape of the car. 24 Now, as Justice Alito said, some people 25 don't care a wit about the shape of the car. They want
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
44 1 just a small car. They want the car that has a certain 2 trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. 3 Experts would come in and say, but it's 4 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body 5 accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 6 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape 7 of the car. What's wrong with that analysis? 8 That's what I understand the government's 9 analysis to be. That that's what a jury has to be told 10 to do, to decide how much value the design is to the 11 product being sold. That's the government's test in a 12 nutshell. 13 MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a test 14 that the government has articulated here at oral 15 argument. It has not been briefed by anybody. 16 The issue of how you calculate total profits 17 on something less than the whole article as sold was 18 wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in 19 the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case, 20 the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test, 21 how do you determine what the article of manufacture is, 22 hasn't provided a lot of difficulty. The real 23 difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the 24 profits from that article of manufacture. 25 The -- the few courts that have addressed
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
1 this that I've seen it have done it in a way that I

45

2 think probably makes the most sense and is the least

3 difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were

4 the costs of producing that article, that particular

5 subcomponent, and what was the company's profit margin

6 on the product as a whole applied to that little

7 component?

8 Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I

9 think that's what courts have generally done. And what

10 it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be

11 appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it

12 underscores is the very --

18 saying, hasn't been briefed adequately. The government

19 is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is

20 that right?

21 MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct

22 that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the

23 total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture

24 to which the design has been applied. That is

25 relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,

46 1 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is 2 the product that's sold. It is more complicated when 3 the jury concludes that the relevant article of 4 manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where 5 customers could choose an array of cases in which to put 6 the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out 7 total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. 8 But the decided cases that I have seen have 9 looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what 10 were the direct costs associated with producing the 11 relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on 12 the piano as applied to that. 13 And may I just add one other point which I 14 think is still on track. The problem with that is that 15 it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress 16 was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design 17 Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters 18 and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only 19 compensation was something that could be viewed as the 20 cost of doing business, that is okay, you're going to 21 get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to 22 produce this little component, there would be no 23 deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency. 24 Yes, Justice Kagan. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let's take a case -- and I

1 think that the VW example is a good example for this

47

2 reason -- where the thing that makes the product

3 distinctive does not cost all that much. There's not

4 been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or

5 some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said

6 I just have this great idea for an appearance. But

7 that's the principal reason why the product has been

8 successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to

9 do all the other things that cars do, but the principal

10 reason why the car has been successful has to do with

11 this particular appearance, the design.

12 As I understood the government, that does

13 not come into the first inquiry. That does not come

14 into the question of what is the article. It only comes

15 into the second inquiry, which is how much of the

16 profits are attributable to that article.

17 Do you agree with that?

18 MR. WAXMAN: I don't think that that -- I

19 don't agree with -- if that is the government's test as

20 you have articulated it, I wouldn't agree with that. I

21 think that the government's -- if you look at the

22 government's factors, you know, one factor is the

23 relative prominence of the design within the product as

24 a whole. And the government says that whether the

25 design -- in other words, whether the design is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
48 1 significant attribute of the entire product affecting 2 the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest 3 that the article should be the product. 4 Another factor in the government's test is 5 the physical relationship between the patented design 6 and the rest of the product. In other words, as the 7 government's brief says, can the user or the seller 8 physically separate it, or is it manufactured 9 separately. 10 Another factor is whether the design is 11 conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, 12 for example, a design on a book binding is different 13 from the intellectual property reflected in the 14 copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with 15 all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, 16 you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the 17 first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence 18 of the design within the product of the whole is in 19 essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in 20 determining the article of manufacture -- whether the 21 patented design is likely to cause the consumers to 22 purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 23 patentee's product. So in the VW Beetle example -- I 24 can't bring myself to call it a "bug." In the VW Beetle 25 example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
49 1 similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or 2 a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebody 3 who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the 4 iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say 5 that, and a jury would take that into account. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is the 7 approach that you're discussing fairly described as 8 "apportionment," or is that a bad word? 9 MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. And 10 if there's a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- what 12 word would you use to describe your approach? 13 MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the article 14 of manufacture, to which the design is applied for 15 purposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive and 16 pleasing appearance. Apportionment is what their 17 expert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying the 18 total profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions of 19 dollars, but I find that only one percent of consumers 20 buy phones because of the front face of the phone either 21 off or on. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you've identified 23 the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily 24 what you're doing is apportioning profits. I just don't 25 see how we can get away from that word.
Alderson Reporting Company

50 1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, Justice 2 Kennedy, the vernacular sense of "apportionment," once 3 you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at 4 step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture 5 is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we 6 determine total profits from the sale of that thing? 7 You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that 8 looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and 9 what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for 10 the car or the refrigerator or something like that. 11 That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if 12 you found it. 13 So, you know, in this case it's a little 14 difficult to figure out what the alternative article of 15 manufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court even 16 before the trial judge, they never even suggested what 17 the article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent, 18 the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is not 20 helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is 21 knows what the determination must -- what determination 22 must be made. The factors are helpful in making the 23 determination. 24 Now what you just said about the article of 25 manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
51 1 applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said? 2 MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury is 3 quoting the statute and this Court's decision in 1872 4 decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture 5 is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes 6 of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing, 7 attractive appearance. That's all you're trying to find 8 out -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physical 10 sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that's 11 what the Chief Justice was talking about. It's applied 12 to the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it in 13 a different sense, and I don't really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- where 15 is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside? 16 No. It's applied to the outside. 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, by 18 definition, applies to the outside. It has to apply to 19 something that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say what 21 it's applied to, you're not talking about it in terms of 22 the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking 23 about? 24 MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked to 25 decide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
52 1 this was a patentable design and you find under Gorham 2 that it was infringed, what is the thing to which that 3 design was applied to give it a pleasing appearance. 4 Obviously, it's not a transistor or some circuit or the 5 software. It is applied to the phone. Now, they could 6 if they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to the 7 jury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's applied to the 9 outside of the phone. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it's always applied to the 12 outside of an article. It has to be applied to the 13 outside of an article. 14 I see my time is expired. Thank you very 15 much. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 Miss Sullivan. Four minutes. 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that 23 all apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can't 24 apportion the value of the design in relation to the 25 article. We're conceding that here. What Congress did
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
53 1 not say is you can't segregate the proper article from 2 the other articles that make up the product. So we can 3 segregate article from other articles within the 4 product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do 5 that because it allows total profit only from that 6 article of manufacture to which the design has applied. 7 Now, the test that we ask the Court to 8 announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two 9 parts. 10 The first is -- the antecedent question is 11 identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes 12 that will be very easy if you do it from two main 13 factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front 14 face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? 15 And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the 16 instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we 17 actually asked the jury to be told that where the 18 article of manufacture is a case or external housing, 19 that's the article of manufacture. 20 The second question is quantum of profits. 21 And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying 22 that a lot of the expert determinations about how much 23 did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into 24 play, as the government said and we agree, only at the 25 second question: What is the quantum of profits from

1 the right article of manufacture?

54

2 But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar

3 are we to the government's test? And, Justice Kennedy,

4 you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency

5 among juries.

6 We think the answer to the first question

7 can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus

8 mainly on two factors: What does the design in the

9 patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the

10 front face? And second, what is the product to which it

11 has been applied? That will help judges to guide

12 juries.

13 We think we should have had instruction

14 42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary

15 judgment that the article of manufacture is the front

16 face, and that could be instructed to the jury.

17 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is

18 that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though

19 they only want to apply it to the front.

20 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --

21 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's the problem in

22 the case. So I thought -- and that's why I pointed to

23 the brief I did point to -- that history is matters

24 here, and we're talking here about a multicomponent

25 product.

55 1 MS. SULLIVAN: That's right, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don't tell the 3 jury that there is that distinction, I think you either 4 disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you 5 create the kind of absurd results that your brief is 6 full of. So that's what I'm looking for. 7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's why I looked at 9 page 23, and it says that seems to do it. 10 MS. SULLIVAN: We're fine with page 23 of 11 the tech company's brief, and that points to why you 12 must remand in this case. 13 This case was tried under the improper rule 14 of law. We tried at every juncture to get the correct 15 rule of law adopted. And the district court said, I 16 forbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we're not 17 asking for apportionment; we're asking for article of 18 manufacture. And we were shut down over and over again 19 on that. 20 So you must remand and tell the nation's 21 economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on 22 a portion of a front face of an electronic device and 23 come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries 24 should be instructed that the article of manufacture 25 either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice

1 Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary

56

2 articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon

3 might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,

4 but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the

5 spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the

6 spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,

7 that's all right.

8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of

9 showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a

10 case like this, Apple will say it's the whole phone.

11 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave

12 you with the most important disagreement we have with

13 the government and with Apple, the burden is on the

14 plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what

15 the article of manufacture is.

16 Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff

17 to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in

18 what the damages are are also always the plaintiff's

19 burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal

20 Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you

21 remand -- vacate and remand.

22 Thank you very much, Your Honor.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

24 The case is submitted.
