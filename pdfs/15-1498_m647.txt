3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 first this morning in Case No. 15-1498, Lynch v. Dimaya. 5 Mr. Kneedler. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 The court of appeals held that the 11 definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C 16(b) is 12 unconstitutionally vague on its face, relying on this 13 Court's decision in Johnson, holding the residual clause 14 in the Armed Career Criminal Act unconstitutionally 15 vague. 16 That was wrong for two reasons. First, the 17 standard of vagueness applicable in an immigration 18 proceeding is not the same as in a criminal proceeding, 19 because the Constitution does not require prior notice 20 that conduct will give rise to removal and also because 21 the immigration laws have long been administered by the 22 executive and administrative proceedings because -23 under broad delegations of authority because of the 24 close relation of immigration to foreign relations and 25 national security.

4 1 Second, though, in any event, under the 2 criminal vagueness standard applied in Johnson 16(b) is 3 not unconstitutional as exemplified by this Court's 4 unanimous decision in Leocal and the more than -- and 5 the more than 30 years that 16(b) has been on the 6 books -7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler, didn't 8 the government argue in -- when Johnson was before us, 9 that if the ACCA residual clause was invalid, then 16(b) 10 would be vulnerable because it was subject to the same 11 central objection. Wasn't that the government's 12 argument? 13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the United 14 States was responding to the argument that -- that was 15 made in Johnson, which was broader than the Court's 16 ultimate rationale. The -- to the extent substantial 17 risk alone was thought to be a problem, the Court made 18 clear in Johnson that cases involving references to 19 substantial risk are not inherently problematic and, in 20 fact, there are -- there are many such -- such ones. 21 The Court focused its analysis on two 22 different aspects, but they -- but they have features 23 that 16(b) does not have and make 16(b) very 24 distinctive. And, in fact, that's the reason why 16(b) 25 has not given rise to the interpretive confusion that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 finally led this Court in Johnson to hold the ACCA

5

2 provision unconstitutional.

3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought the Johnson,

4 two features at issue were the fact that we were asking

5 courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there

6 was no way to even think about what that was.

7 Your adversary points out, with burglary, if

8 the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level

9 of risk. If it's at night, there's a different level of

10 risk. The nature of the entry is at question, whether

11 it's forcible or merely walking through an open door

12 uninvited. It may be easier with burglary for lots of

13 reasons, but there -- the level of what -- or what

14 constitutes an ordinary crime was somewhat at the center

15 of Johnson. Why isn't it at the center here?

16 MR. KNEEDLER: Because I -- I -- there are

17 several very important distinctions between this case

18 and Johnson with -- with respect to that.

19 The -- the ACCA residual clause spoke in

20 terms of a serious potential risk that serious injury to

21 another person might -- might result. And as the Court

22 pointed out, that created uncertainty about things that

23 could happen even after the offense was committed and

24 injury to people, bystanders or anyone else it could be.

25 Section 16(b) is very different in that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 respect. It asks whether the offense by its nature

6

2 presents a substantial risk that physical force will be

3 used against the person or property of another, and

4 that's very different in several respects.

5 It confines the analysis in both a temporal

6 and functional sense to the elements of the offense.

7 You don't look at what conduct might -- might have

8 happened afterward. It focuses narrowly on the elements

9 of the offense because the -- the question is whether

10 the use of physical force might be used in the course of

11 committing that offense.

12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, may I ask,

13 Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was

14 confusing to me because sometimes you're talking about

15 temporal, and sometimes you're talking about functional.

16 And I want to know what you think the real limitation

17 is. So take the example that you use, which is the

18 possession of a shotgun example; right?

19 MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: And you say that that would

21 fall outside of Section 16.

22 MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

23 JUSTICE KAGAN: And the question is why?

24 Temporally, you know, you're possessing a shotgun when

25 you shoot somebody. You can't do it any other way. So

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 the temporal analysis doesn't work. So what is it about 2 that example that makes it fall outside of Section 16, 3 whereas you argued it would have fallen inside of ACCA? 4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- well, first of 5 all, in ACCA that was part of the confusion. That was 6 the confusion in Johnson itself. 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, exactly. 8 MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but -9 JUSTICE KAGAN: So why are you so sure that 10 there would not be the confusion under Section 16? 11 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think, again, because 12 of Leocal. And the courts after Leocal have had no 13 problem concluding that it was not covered. And the 14 reason is that Leocal -- excuse me -- 16(b) requires a 15 risk of the use of physical force, the -- an act of 16 violent crime, as the Court described it in Leocal, and 17 the possession of a -- of a sawed-off shotgun at any 18 particular moment in time. It doesn't have to culminate 19 in its use at all for -- for -20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's absolutely 21 true. And that's what gave us trouble in ACCA because 22 it could culminate in its use, but it didn't have to 23 culminate in its use. 24 But then you take a case like burglary, and 25 you could say the exact same thing about burglary.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
8 1 Somebody could walk in on a burglary and all of a sudden 2 there would be a use of force. But a burglary could 3 happen in such a way that nobody walked in and there 4 wouldn't be a use of force. 5 So, again, it just seems as though we're 6 replicating the same kind of confusions, and there's 7 nothing that separates the two. 8 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Or at least I'm trying to 10 find out -11 MR. KNEEDLER: I -12 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what you think separates 13 the two. 14 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I don't -- I -- I don't 15 think so, because another important aspect or textual 16 point in 16(b) is whether the offense by its nature 17 presents a substantial risk. "By its nature" means in 18 its natural, ordinary sense. And, for example, in 19 Leocal, said in no -- the Court said in no ordinary or 20 natural sense could the -- could DUI be regarded as the 21 affirmative use of physical force. It's not a 22 violent -23 JUSTICE KAGAN: You know -24 MR. KNEEDLER: -- crime. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- I -- I was very struck by
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 that language, too. And I think it's that language,

9

2 more than some of the other language you pointed to in

3 its brief, that might suggest that there's some

4 distinction between 16(b) and -- and the ACCA residual

5 clause.

6 But on the other hand, "by its nature" seems

7 to suggest an elements focus, a real elements focus.

8 Look at the elements and ask, given those elements,

9 given the nature of the offense, what's going to happen?

10 But, you know, the elements section of Section 16 is

11 Section 16(a). So it can't be all about all elements.

12 So what is that "by its nature" doing?

13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's by its nature of

14 the offense, which would incorporate its elements. We

15 think elements are central to both (a) and (b). (a)

16 involves the actual -- actual use of force or threat in

17 use of force or attempted use of force. The element is

18 the actual or threatened use of force. Whereas under

19 16(b), the question is whether the elements add up to an

20 offense in which there is a risk of force being used,

21 even if it doesn't have to.

22 And burglary -- I think burglary is a

23 classic example -- is a classic example of that. And I

24 think --

25 JUSTICE KAGAN: But why isn't also

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 possession of a shotgun a classic example of that?

10

2 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, let me explain, if I

3 may.

4 Burglary is -- is descended from the common

5 law, and its rationale is precisely because of the risk

6 that the -- that the burglar will encounter someone in

7 the course of committing the burglary. And -- and it --

8 it is logical, built into, inherent in the crime of

9 burglary that there may be a response to an uninvited

10 entry into a home or -- or other structure. By its

11 nature, that transaction, that -- those elements of

12 burglary create the risk that force will have to be

13 used. The same is true of kidnapping.

14 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and give me a

15 contrast. And by contrast, what that fell under the

16 ACCA residual clause would not fall under 16(b) because

17 the same thing could not be said.

18 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I mean, one that did

19 not fall under the -- the ACCA --

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: No. Give me one that would

21 fall under the ACCA residual clause, but -- but -- or

22 where there was confusion as to whether it fell under

23 the residual clause.

24 MR. KNEEDLER: Begay -- Begay is a good

25 example there. It was precisely the -- the crime

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
11 1 involved in Leocal where the Court had no trouble in a 2 two-page decision saying that DUI is not covered because 3 of this textual difference, because there has to be risk 4 of the use of force, which is not the accidental or sort 5 of negligent conduct. 6 Whereas in Begay, the Court struggled with 7 how to -- how to deal with that under the residual 8 clause. It -- it created an extra-textual limitation, 9 the purposeful, violent, aggressive test in order to 10 weed out negligent or accidental offenses. Whereas the 11 explicit text of -- of 16(b) itself takes care of that 12 problem. So that is an important difference. 13 Another important difference, though, that I 14 haven't mentioned yet is that the residual clause tied 15 the level of risk to four enumerated offenses, which 16 were not consistent with each other. 17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that you're quite 18 right that that was one of the arguments in Johnson that 19 they said make the statute confusing. It -- it does 20 seem odd before we look at Johnson that giving examples 21 makes the statute more vague. It's a -- it's a little 22 counterintuitive. 23 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you're 25 correct. I think that's the way the Johnson court saw
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 it.


12

2 MR. KNEEDLER: And I -- and I think the -- I

3 think the problem was not examples per se, but -- but

4 the fact that they were conflicting examples that I

5 think the court came to conclude embedded an

6 arbitrariness into the ACCA residual clause in all its

7 applications. And that -- and that's effectively

8 what -- there was, like, an ingredient in that statute

9 that made it incapable of consistent application.

10 That's not true here.

11 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Kneedler, it's

12 absolutely right that the court in Johnson said that

13 those examples compounded the problem. But the

14 essential problem that the court thought existed was the

15 use of the ordinary case analysis. So I'm just going to

16 ask you the question that the court asked in Johnson,

17 and I'd -- I -- how do we answer this question? This is

18 what the court said in Johnson:

19 "How does one go about deciding what kind of

20 conduct the ordinary case of a crime involves? A

21 statistical analysis of the State reporter? A survey?

22 Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct? So that's a

23 multiple-choice test. What do we do?

24 MR. KNEEDLER: The --

25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because that is still the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 same under this statute.

13

2 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it's not the

3 same. Again, unlike -- unlike in the ACCA residual

4 clause, you start out by looking at the elements of the

5 offense. What -- and are the elements of the offense

6 such that, by their nature, they give rise to a

7 substantial risk of injury?

8 Now, for some offenses, I think that you can

9 look at the long history of the offense. And burglary

10 is an example. Indeed, in Leocal, this Court said that

11 burglary is a classic example of a crime of violence.

12 And, in fact, the Senate Report on this provision says

13 that burglary is the classic example. And if one looks

14 at LeFave or other historical materials, it is because

15 of the risk of force that might be used. Of course,

16 this -- this statute also concerned risk to property.

17 So certain offenses, I think the --

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: So can I give you another

19 example just to test how this test works? You say you

20 look to the elements of the -- the offense to see if

21 they give rise to a risk of injury. Do I have that

22 right?

23 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. How do we do

25 vehicular flight under that example? I'm just trying to


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 sort of ground this. And you might be right. I'm

14

2 not -- you know, I'm just trying to figure out what the

3 difference is if we look at it that way, because that

4 doesn't sound so different from what we were trying to

5 do in ACCA. In fact, it sounds kind of the same as,

6 honestly.

7 So give me vehicular flight. How does it

8 work?

9 MR. KNEEDLER: Vehicular flight from a

10 police officer after being ordered to stop is, again, if

11 you think by its nature, what -- what was the

12 legislature envisioning when it enacted that? And I

13 think, again, it's parallel to burglary. The conduct is

14 such that in the -- in the course of committing the

15 offense, in the course of the flight, not something that

16 might be collateral or down the road, is the --

17 JUSTICE KAGAN: So that would fall on -- on

18 the included side? Because I -- I had thought that your

19 brief said something different, but maybe I misread it.

20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it may depend on the

21 elements of the particular State statute. One can't

22 give an across-the-board answer to -- to any one label

23 for -- for a type of offense without looking at the

24 elements. But, for example, in -- in vehicular flight

25 or any statute, the State law might, for example, have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
15 1 gradations, which would show that the more aggravated 2 version is one that the legislature had singled out 3 because of the particular risk. So it's -- it's 4 important to look at the State statute and what was it 5 driving at? What are the -- what are the elements? 6 What -- what harms was it -- was it intending? 7 JUSTICE KAGAN: And go back to possession of 8 a shotgun, because I'm running over in my mind my memory 9 of the Johnson oral argument where basically the SG's 10 office made exactly this argument about possession of a 11 shotgun, how the elements of that offense are understood 12 to give rise to a significant level of risk. 13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think the concern, 14 one of the concerns mentioned in -- in Johnson was what 15 if the shotgun might be used way down the road remotely 16 from that -- from any -- remote in time from any moment 17 in time when the -- when the person was arrested 18 possessing the shotgun. 19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Presumably, the person is 20 possessing the shotgun when the person kills somebody, 21 so it's -- temporally, I don't think that that argument 22 works. 23 MR. KNEEDLER: No. The -- the offense 24 continues for the entire duration of possession, but 25 we're not saying that that's enough. There has to be a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
16 1 substantial risk in the -- in the course of committing 2 the offense. And as one of the -3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I remember the 4 government arguing in Johnson that most people who are 5 found with sawed-off shotguns are committing crimes. 6 Why isn't that a substantial risk of force being used? 7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If statistically -- if 9 statistically -- and I don't remember the statistics 10 now, but they were very clear then that a huge amount -11 number of the crimes of possession of a shotgun were -12 led to criminal activity. 13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it is the -- is 14 the use of force necessary for the crime of possession 15 of the shotgun. And -- and possession itself -16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the use of force 17 is not necessary for the use of -- for burglary if you 18 walk in and there's nobody there. You take what you 19 find. 20 MR. KNEEDLER: No. But the -- but the 21 historical understanding of burglary is precisely that 22 it will, that it will -23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we're now going back 24 to gut instinct. 25 MR. KNEEDLER: No. It's not gut instinct.

1 I think anything but. I -- I think a court looks at

17

2 the, again, the elements of the offense judicial

3 interpretation, so the statute analysis of what the

4 State legislature was driving at, State judicial

5 decisions that might themselves describe what the risk

6 is or the risk that was being addressed by the -- by the

7 offense. It's a legal -- it's a legal question. A

8 judge's experience, however, for something like burglary

9 can be quite informative.

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Before your white light

11 goes on, could you address your first argument that the

12 vagueness standard is different here than in -- than in

13 Johnson?

14 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I might say, Jordan v.

16 deGeorge, a case from some years ago, is a little more

17 persuasive than I had thought for the Respondent -- for

18 the Respondent here. You could say it's dictum because

19 they didn't really need to reach the issue based on

20 their holding.

21 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think there are a

22 number of things to be said about deGeorge. You're

23 right. The issue is not addressed. The court applied

24 what seemed to be the same standard, but it -- but it

25 wasn't briefed.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

18

2 MR. KNEEDLER: And so the question of -- of

3 how it would apply in that setting wasn't addressed.

4 Also --

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Something has to be

6 briefed before we say it's the law?

7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Court often -- if

8 the Court has what might be referred to as a drive-by

9 ruling, I wouldn't say it was drive-by. It was

10 considered, but -- but usually you want adversarial

11 presentation by the parties.

12 For example, one important -- several

13 important aspects of deGeorge, it did not discuss this

14 Court's earlier decision in the Mahler case in which the

15 Court indicated that there could be a looser standard

16 of -- or would be a looser standard of vagueness in

17 immigration cases specifically point out -- pointing out

18 a critical difference. And that is that the ex post

19 facto clause does not apply to immigration; therefore, a

20 person can be removed for conduct that was not a basis

21 for removal before you engaged in that conduct, criminal

22 or not. And, therefore, the notice piece of -- of the

23 vagueness standard really didn't fit well in the -- in

24 the immigration context.

25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That observation was at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 a time before the draconian effects of removal and

19

2 deportation came into effect. We now have lifetime

3 bars, which were rarely or on very limited circumstances

4 imposed previously. We have many more criminal

5 sanctions with harsher sentences now. I think more than

6 anything we have often said that vagueness depends on

7 the gravity of what is at stake. Today what's at stake

8 is a lot more than what was at stake decades ago.

9 MR. KNEEDLER: But what -- what's at stake

10 can't be viewed just from that perspective. What's at

11 stake is the fact that the immigration laws are vital to

12 the nation's national security and foreign relations and

13 the safety and welfare of the country. And --

14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there is always the

15 fail safe that the Attorney General in his or her

16 discretion can deny -- can deny anyone the right to stay

17 here. But if we're going to ask immigration judges to

18 impose the consequences that they do today, don't we

19 need something that's not arbitrary?

20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I can address

21 several pieces of that. While there are more criminal

22 offenses now that give rise to removal, the same basic

23 point obtains, which is that a person can be removed on

24 a ground that was not a criminal offense, or it was not

25 a basis for removal at the time he engaged in that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
20 1 conduct. Again, whether it's a crime or not a crime. 2 That means that the alien has no constitutionally-based 3 right to notice. And, therefore, the notice piece of 4 the Vagueness Doctrine has far less force in this 5 context. 6 JUSTICE ALITO: If the Court -- if the Court 7 were to hold that 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague in 8 criminal cases, what would the impact -- in criminal 9 cases involving the application of the categorical 10 approach, what would the -- what would the implications 11 of that be? 12 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as we cite in our 13 brief, there are a number of places in Title 18 where 14 the definition of crime of violence is used, either by 15 express reference to 16(b) or by use of the same 16 formulation like in 924C where the same formulation 17 is -- is used. 18 JUSTICE ALITO: What would be some of the 19 most important examples? 20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, that would be -- that 21 would be one. 16(b) is incorporated into offenses 22 dealing with money laundering, hijack robbery, I 23 believe. A number of other -- it's also used to 24 determined whether a juvenile will be prosecuted. 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't that --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
21 1 doesn't that suggest that the argument that the civil 2 standards apply rather than the criminal one loses some 3 of its force for precisely that reason? 4 MR. KNEEDLER: No. I don't think so. For 5 one thing, I think it's -- it's important to recall that 6 16(b) is just a definition. It is not a statement of a 7 crime on its own. It is a -- it is a definition or 8 identifying a category of offenses that are then plugged 9 into some other statute, either a criminal offense or 10 the immigration laws. In the immigration laws, for 11 example, it's identifying a category of crimes that 12 are -- that constitute a ground for removal just like 13 all of the other aggravated felony provisions. 14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought the point 15 the Chief Justice is underscoring is that if we go -- if 16 we base the decision on the fact that -- that this is 17 civil, then you have to come back here for other cases 18 under -19 MR. KNEEDLER: No. That is -- that is true. 20 And -- and for that reason, the Court may well want to, 21 in our view, sustain 16(b) by applying the criminal 22 standard, because if it -- if it is sustained under the 23 criminal standard, as we think it clearly should be, 24 then -- then a for certiori it would be -- it would be 25 constitutional in the --
Alderson Reporting Company

22 1 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think of the 2 idea suggested in Justice Alito's opinion that the word 3 "offense" like the word "crime" both those words are 4 ambiguous. They can refer either to a category of 5 behaviors that many people can engage in or they can 6 refer to this behavior that this defendant engaged in on 7 this particular instance. 8 So he said, as I read it, let's back up. 9 Can't be done. Congress thought both in this statute 10 and in the other statute, it wouldn't be that tough to 11 categorize all the State criminal laws by their degree 12 of risk of violence. Can't be done. Too many State 13 criminal laws used in too many different ways, too many 14 different words, no statistics are kept, the Justice 15 Department can't get them, so we're left guessing. So 16 let's back up and look at what this person did on this 17 occasion. What is your reaction to that? 18 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, we -- we have not 19 argued that because this Court -20 JUSTICE BREYER: I think you argued it. I 21 just wanted to know what your reaction is. 22 MR. KNEEDLER: But this Court's decision in 23 Leocal said the categorical approach applies. If -- if 24 this Court were to conclude that this could not be 25 sustained under -- under the criminal standard, that may
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 be one option. It may be a particular option.

23

2 JUSTICE BREYER: You'd have to have it

3 argued. But I think if you really did that, I just

4 don't know if you thought it through at the SG's office

5 about the pros and cons. And in case -- you needn't

6 have done -- but in case you have done, I'd -- I'd

7 appreciate your telling us what you all think even if

8 you're not stuck with it. I know that's unusual for you

9 to be stuck with it. I'm just curious.

10 MR. KNEEDLER: There obviously would be

11 advantages in the sense that the statute would be --

12 would be preserved. There could be questions, though,

13 about how it would be administered to determine what

14 actually happened on the prior occasion. But one -- one

15 place where, you know, the Court might want to consider

16 reserving, if that were -- if that were an issue, would

17 be 924C where the -- where the crime of violence is

18 contemporaneous with the possession of the -- of the

19 firearm. And so you're not looking at a past offense,

20 you're looking at the overall offense in which the -- in

21 which the -- the weapon was possessed.

22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could -- could I ask, just

23 in thinking through your argument, it would help me to

24 get a few examples.

25 So could you give me three examples, let's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
24 1 say, if there are in -- if there are those -- that many, 2 where we struggled under ACCA, but where the answer is 3 clear under 16(b), so that I understand what it -- what 4 kind of distinction you're drawing. 5 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I think DUI is 6 sort -- is the prime example. Leocal itself concluded 7 that DUI was not covered. In -- in a unanimous opinion, 8 it's only -- the Court's only occasion to have to 9 address this in 30 years because of the text of 16(b), 10 the act -- it requires the act of use of force. I think 11 the sawed-off shotgun, which this Court in Torres said 12 was not covered by 16(b), and -- and we believe that 13 that's correct, again, because of the -- the -- you 14 don't have to use force in order to possess the -- the 15 shotgun, even though injury could result under the ACCA 16 clause, perhaps, and that's what -- that's what was 17 confusing under the -- under the ACCA clause. 18 So I -- I think those are two prime 19 examples. But I -- 16(b) -20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Anything else? Because this 21 is really important for me. 22 MR. KNEEDLER: Yeah. Well -- well -23 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm trying to figure out 24 what our differences are. 25 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And -- and in -- in
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
25 1 Begay, where the Court formulated the extra-textual test 2 of the act -- I forget the precise words, but violent 3 aggressive conduct, it pointed out that some such 4 limitation was also necessary because of -- otherwise 5 like pollution offenses or -- or consumer product 6 offenses might be covered. 7 So the Court -- the Court again was -- was 8 juggling with the way the ACCA residual clause operates 9 in order to figure out how to exclude that one. There's 10 no question that those crimes are clearly excluded under 11 the ACCA clause. 12 On the other hand, some other crimes besides 13 burglary, like kidnapping or escape, I think if -- if 14 one pictures those offenses, they clearly present a risk 15 that physical force will be used and give this statute a 16 core of -- of valid applications that it can't be held 17 unconstitutional on its face. 18 If I may -19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The immigration judge 20 also found that the -- these burglaries qualified as 21 crimes of moral turpitude. Another ground for removal. 22 Does -- does burglary qualify as -- as a crime of moral 23 turpitude? 24 MR. KNEEDLER: I think in some circumstances 25 it may. I think it may depend on the -- on the nature

6 Mr. Rosenkranz.

7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief

10 Justice, and may it please the Court:

11 As Justice Sotomayor points out, there were

12 two critical factors that this Court pointed to in

13 Johnson that, quote, "conspired to make the ACCA

14 residual clause unconstitutional." Everyone agrees that

15 they are both present here. It's hypothesizing the

16 ordinary instance, the ordinary case of a set of

17 elements, and second, then from that hypothesis,

18 estimating the degree of risk of some sort. And as

19 Justice Ginsburg points out, the government correctly,

20 back in Johnson, said that those two factors are in

21 existence here in Section 16(b), and that the residual

22 clause here was, quote, "equally susceptible to

23 challenge."

24 JUSTICE KAGAN: There was something that --

25 that isn't here, Mr. Rosenkranz, and that is a long

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 history of struggling and failing to come up with an

27

2 interpretation. And I'm wondering why you think we

3 don't have that same history. Because I don't think

4 that there's any question that we would not have said

5 what we said in Johnson had Johnson been the first case.

6 Johnson was the umpteenth case, and we had

7 gone back and forth and we had struggled and we couldn't

8 figure out, and -- and here we don't seem to have any of

9 that. It seems as though -- and not only with respect

10 to this Court, but with respect to lower courts -- it

11 seems that everybody is getting along just fine. And

12 much as I can't quite understand what the difference is,

13 there just does seem to be a difference in practice.

14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Justice Kagan, let

15 me -- let me give two answers. The first is that this

16 whole notion that the government is discussing about a

17 different experience with ACCA than with Section 16(b)

18 is revisionist history.

19 Every single ACCA case that this Court

20 decided was presented to this Court in simultaneous cert

21 petitions in the 16(b) context, and this Court would

22 then JVR the 16(b) cases, and the lower courts and this

23 Court would then cross-reference ACCA case -- ACCA

24 residual clause cases into Section 16(b), treating them

25 equivalently.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
28 1 So this Court's experience with the ACCA 2 residual clause is its experience with Section 16(b). 3 And the whole series of questions you asked, Justice 4 Kagan, about well, what about Sykes, how would this turn 5 out here? What about Chambers? What about Johnson 6 itself? Every single one of those cases is coming back 7 here. We know that they're coming. Sykes is already -8 the -- that is, the Sykes issue -- is already presented 9 as a circuit conflict right now in the lower courts. It 10 is roiling the lower courts. There's a Fifth Circuit 11 case where the majority and the dissent of Sykes are 12 being played out in the Fifth Circuit right now. And 13 the same will be true of all of those. 14 And then, secondly, it is simply not true to 15 say that -- I'd like to say that everyone is getting 16 along just fine in the lower courts. Between our brief 17 and the National Immigration Project, we've identified 18 10 circuit splits, some of them on exactly identical 19 elements. And what is the problem with those cases? 20 The courts on either side -- it's not just that they're 21 engaged in different elemental analysis. The courts on 22 each side are fundamentally disagreeing about what the 23 ordinary case of a particular crime is. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what of the argument 25 that 16(b) is more precise? For one thing, it is
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
29 1 limited to in the course of commission of the offense, 2 and that the offender must be the one who uses the 3 force. And in addition, it covers use of force against 4 the victim's property. So it -- it has a specificity 5 that the ACCA residual clause lacked. 6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, let me start 7 with the -- with in-the-course-of, which took a -- a lot 8 of Mr. Kneedler's argument time. 9 Two things -- well, three things to say 10 about it. First, courts have uniformly held that 11 in-the-course-of does not entail a temporal limitation, 12 that it doesn't -13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it -- wasn't the 14 word during the "commission" of? Is it -- in the course 15 of or during the commission of? 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: In -- in -17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In 16(b). 18 MR. ROSENKRANZ: In 16(b), the phrase that 19 the government is speaking of is "in the course of 20 committing the offense." 21 And so, just to -- to continue that first 22 answer, courts have held that inchoate offenses of the 23 sort that -- that Justice Kagan was asking about, or 24 possession offenses, do create the risk, and 25 appropriately so, because -- or let's take another
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 example that -- that consumed a lot of time today:

30

2 Burglary.

3 Justice Kagan's question about burglary.

4 Notably, that is why in Leocal this Court held that

5 burglary did -- was sort of the classic example of a

6 16(b) violent crime. Burglary, as this Court said in

7 Johnson, it's complete at the moment you cross the

8 threshold. If all we are looking at is the temporal, so

9 when are the elements completed, entering with the bad

10 intent is what completes the elephant -- the -- the

11 elements. So if someone enters, they have completed the

12 elements. They can then ransack the apartment for the

13 next five hours. That is still in the course of

14 committing the offense.

15 Second answer, the government's new

16 interpretation does not change the fundamentally

17 imaginary nature of the inquiry, no matter what. Courts

18 will still be imagining the ordinary case. Only now you

19 have to further imagine, okay, in that ordinary case,

20 when are the elements typically satisfied?

21 And, finally, that textual difference is not

22 actually a textual difference. ACCA says -- the ACCA

23 residual clause says the same thing in different words.

24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course -- of

25 course, courts and legislatures always have to imagine

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 consequences when they are classifying crimes. They

31

2 have to define what burglary is, because they know that

3 in a significant number of cases certain consequences

4 will happen. That -- that's the way the law works.

5 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, of course, Your Honor.

6 And if this were just to the question that Justice Alito

7 asked Mr. Kneedler about ramifications, if this is -- if

8 this were just about importing 16(b) into the

9 definitions of various crimes, there's no vagueness

10 problem, because as this Court said in Johnson -- and it

11 addressed exactly that question in Johnson, it's a

12 totally different inquiry when -- when you are applying

13 the stated elements to an actual concrete example that

14 is there before the Court.

15 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Rosenkranz, could I ask

16 you this: Suppose Congress enacted a statute that said

17 any person who commits a crime of moral turpitude in the

18 District of Columbia or with -- within the special or

19 maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United

20 States shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years,

21 would that be unconstitutionally vague?

22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it would

23 certainly be problematic. And the reason it would be

24 problematic is because you don't have an administrative

25 agency that then gives content to the moral turpitude

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 language the way you do, for example, in the immigration 2 context. And by the way, an agency to -- to which 3 deference is owed. But this is a statute, 16(b), that 4 is a criminal statute -5 JUSTICE ALITO: But that seems to me -- I 6 mean, I'm surprised by -- somewhat surprised by your 7 answer. That seems to me to be at least as vague as 8 16(b). And yet the holding in the Jordan case on which 9 you rely was that that -- that a -- a deportation 10 statute that permitted deportation for a person 11 convicted of a crime of moral turpitude satisfied the 12 applicable vagueness standard there. So -13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, yes, Justice Alito. 14 And -- and that's -- so that is the distinction. So 15 today, moral turpitude -- "moral turpitude" is a phrase 16 that the -- the executive agency has defined. People 17 know what it means. They know what's in, and they know 18 what's out. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: But, I mean, unless you're 20 willing to say that the criminal statute that I 21 hypothesized would satisfy vagueness standards, I -- I 22 don't see how you can say that the same vagueness 23 standard applies in criminal cases and deportation 24 cases. 25 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the same
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
33 1 vagueness standard does apply in -- in the two contexts, 2 but -3 JUSTICE ALITO: So why does crime -- then 4 the statute making a crime of saying anyone who commits 5 a crime of moral turpitude sentenced to 20 -- up to 20 6 years, that would be -- that would satisfy vagueness for 7 a criminal statute? 8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: In a criminal statute, it 9 would not, because there is no history of agency 10 interpretations to which courts must defer. 11 But let me just back up for a moment. 12 JUSTICE ALITO: What -- is DUI a crime of 13 moral turpitude? 14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I have no idea. 15 JUSTICE ALITO: How about failure to file an 16 income tax return? 17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I mean, I don't know what 18 the agency interpretations of moral turpitude -19 JUSTICE ALITO: How about unlawful entry 20 into the United States? 21 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I think not. But let me 22 just back up, because Your Honor has moved into the 23 second issue. 24 I just want to be clear that, in our view 25 and in the view of all of the lower courts, Jordan
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 settles the question on whether it's the same standard 2 for criminal deportation. But this Court does not have 3 to embrace Jordan or even address the question whether 4 it's the same standard. 16(b) is a criminal statute 5 that Congress chose to import wholesale into the 6 immigration laws and that -- that has criminal 7 applications even under the INA. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Johnson talked a lot 9 about the confusion caused by the predicate offenses 10 that were -- were listed; in fact, in colorful terms 11 explained why those compounded the vagueness in the 12 residual clause. And, of course, you don't have those 13 here. 14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. So -- so 15 I would start with where -- with where Justice Kennedy 16 started, which is, as a general matter, one does not 17 ordinarily think that giving examples makes something 18 more vague than it would otherwise be. 19 And I know this Court spent a lot of time 20 trying to draw lessons from those examples with 21 varying -- with -- actually with no success under 22 varying methodologies to try to narrow the -- what is 23 otherwise a vague statute. And the government's 24 argument in Johnson was that -- that Congress succeeded 25 in narrowing with those enumerated elements, those
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 enumerated crimes, and this Court concluded that it

35

2 didn't.

3 But a statute that has examples, even if

4 they are confusing examples, has to be better than a

5 statute that is --

6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the

7 statute as a whole might be because you can look at it

8 and say, well, there's one of the examples. But it

9 seems to me that argument doesn't respond to the point

10 that it makes the residual clause much more confusing if

11 the examples seem to be pointing in different directions

12 and -- and involve different -- totally different

13 consequences.

14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Right.

15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Basically, what the

16 Court held in Johnson.

17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So --

18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that,

19 yes, it's clear when you get to the specific thing

20 that's named, but that, as the Court explained, it makes

21 it much more confusing -- confusing when you get to the

22 residual clause.

23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So -- so I think the -- the

24 easiest way to look at this, I would say, is if that --

25 if that had been the pivotal factor in Johnson -- so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
36 1 Johnson says there are two factors that conspired. If 2 it had been indeed that other factor, what this Court 3 should have done in Johnson is to say, we will now, as a 4 matter of statutory construction, stop trying to draw 5 lessons from those examples and interpret the residual 6 clause in its own right without trying to figure out 7 whether the examples teach something about the 8 relationships. 9 This Court had an obligation to save the 10 statute if that's what was causing the problem. It 11 didn't. And I think it was -- this Court was very 12 conscious of what it was doing when it said that there 13 were two critical things that conspired -- two critical 14 elements that conspired to make the statute vague. 15 And then in Welch, when this Court repeated 16 what its holding was and its rationale was in Johnson, 17 it repeated those same two critical elements, not this 18 third one about the enumerated clause. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I see that. The thing 20 underlying this is -- which is a difficult case -- if we 21 say you're right, what then do we say about moral 22 turpitude, unfair competition, just and reasonable 23 rates, public convenience and necessity, and there are a 24 hundred others and they're all civil. 25 Now, what you've suggested is -- well, what
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
37 1 you say is this. You say that the Constitution requires 2 the creation of an administrative agency which will 3 develop a tradition over time that will clarify, but 4 will otherwise -- that kind of reasoning was present in 5 the nondelegation doctrine. So what you want to say is 6 that which would -- that which would have saved a 7 statute under the nondelegation doctrine, which is not 8 fair competition, it's delegation of unriot, but which 9 is -- gives meaning is also necessary to save a civil 10 statute from vagueness. 11 Hmm. That's a very interesting holding. 12 I'd rather read it in a law review article than I would 13 write those words which will suddenly become real. 14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well -15 JUSTICE BREYER: So I'm not -- I'm not -- do 16 you see where I'm floating on this? I -- I see your 17 point, it's quite similar, but I quite worry about the 18 implications. 19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so 20 let's -- so let's talk about the immigration that's 21 in -- excuse me -- the implications that is in the 22 immigration context to begin with. 23 In the immigration context, to the extent 24 that Your Honor -- that you are quoting, Justice Breyer, 25 from --
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
38 1 JUSTICE BREYER: I was quoting Cordoza. I'm 2 happy to be confused with him. 3 (Laughter.) 4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I confuse you all the time 5 with him. 6 So to the extent that we're focusing on 7 language that appears in the immigration statutes, that 8 language has been interpreted. And that is a key 9 distinction between this case and Mahler, for example, 10 with -- with -- which Mr. Kneedler invoked. 11 Mahler was a situation in which Congress had 12 defined the crimes that would make you deportable. And 13 the problem was that the Attorney General could then 14 exercise discretion as to whether he would deport you or 15 not. And it was couched in terms of delegation because 16 it was pre-Chevron and pre-Schechter Poultry. But this 17 Court said, no, the fact that there is discretion 18 doesn't bother us. 19 Now, the second answer is in the immigration 20 context, as distinguished from perhaps any other 21 context, as Justice Sotomayor was saying, the 22 immigration context in particular is a context that 23 implicates liberty with the severest sorts of 24 consequences. So at a minimum in the immigration 25 context, completely apart from the public good sorts of

1 questions and applications of civil --

39

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rosenkranz, I guess I

3 would have thought that your answer would have been

4 different. I guess I would have thought that your

5 answer would have been whatever implications Johnson had

6 for Vagueness Doctrine, it has already had, and that all

7 you are asking us to do is just essentially to say that

8 this statute is no different from the statute that we

9 looked at in Johnson and to write an opinion that

10 basically just repeats Johnson. And whatever

11 implications it's had or it will have, it will have

12 regardless, and this opinion would do nothing more.

13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor.

14 Yes.

15 (Laughter.)

16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: What she said.

17 JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, if that's your

18 answer, it totally ignores that this is not a criminal

19 case. And it certainly is true that deportation has

20 more severe consequences than the typical civil case.

21 But there are many other civil cases that can have a

22 devastating impact on someone, such as child custody,

23 loss of a professional license, complete destruction of

24 a business, loss of the home. Now, assuming that there

25 is some sort of vagueness standard that applies in civil

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
40 1 cases, I would have thought your answer would be that 2 it's a sliding scale and that the -- the standard for 3 civil cases is not the same as the standard for criminal 4 cases. But how much specificity is required in the 5 civil context depends on the severity of the 6 consequences of the case. 7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, so, Justice Alito, 8 this Court in Hoffman said that it's a sliding scale. 9 But in Jordan, when it came to deportation, which this 10 Court has described as the gravest sort of consequence 11 which directly implicates liberty interests, this Court 12 said it's at the same level as -13 JUSTICE ALITO: No. That's not exactly the 14 way the Court -- what the Court said, or at least it's 15 not necessary to read Jordan that way. I think Jordan 16 can be read to say, look, the dissent has raised this 17 new argument, it wasn't briefed, it wasn't argued. The 18 dissent says this is unconstitutionally vague; we are 19 going to apply the criminal standard here and it 20 satisfies the criminal standard. It -- it didn't say 21 assume for the sake of argument, but I think it can 22 certainly be read that way. And if you don't read it 23 that way, you are stuck with a conclusion that a statute 24 making a crime of moral turpitude punishable by a felony 25 term of imprisonment would satisfy the vagueness
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 standard for a criminal statute, which I think is very 2 difficult to defend. 3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, let me 4 say, again, two things. The first thing, this Court 5 doesn't have to decide whether Jordan equated criminal 6 cases and civil cases with the most severe consequences, 7 because this is a criminal statute that this Court is 8 interpreting and it has criminal consequences even as 9 imported through the INA. And I just -10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, would you say the same 11 thing if it didn't -- if this statute did not 12 incorporate a definition that is also used in criminal 13 statutes and simply had the same standard in a purely 14 immigration statute? So no reference to a -- a 15 definition that also applies in criminal cases. 16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I would have a different 17 argument. But let me just maybe clear, this Court has 18 said -- and it said in A.B. Small. It took a statute 19 that was held unconstitutional -- and this was back in 20 1924, '25 -- found -- the statute that this Court found 21 unconstitutional in the criminal context. It was then 22 applied -- it was a silly breach of contract case 23 applied as a defense. And this Court said, no. When we 24 struck it over there, we're going to strike the civil 25 ramifications here as well. And this Court could adopt
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 a very narrow holding, saying that what Congress has

42

2 done is to make the decision to import a criminal

3 statute into a civil context. It brings the soil with

4 the roots. And there's no such thing. It's actually

5 incoherent.

6 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't think that makes the

7 slightest bit of sense. Suppose there were a criminal

8 statute that says that it is a crime -- it is a felony

9 to charge an unjust rate. And then the -- there was a

10 civil statute that incorporated that, and we would say,

11 well, because you can't make it a felony to charge an --

12 an unjust rate or price. You can't have that in the

13 civil statute. You can't incorporate it into the civil

14 statute.

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, you just

16 recited the facts of A.B. Small. That was exactly the

17 statute there. It was struck in the criminal context.

18 It was then imported as a defense in the civil context,

19 and this Court said in A.B. Small, we don't care whether

20 it's civil or criminal. If it was struck there, we're

21 going to strike it here.

22 And there's an important kind of

23 separation-of-powers reason to do this. Congress made

24 the decision to equate the two. Congress didn't --

25 Congress could have used different words and revised the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
43 1 statute. But think of it in the RICO context. Let's 2 take a classic case that this Court has decided. The 3 definition of "gangster" this Court held in Renzetta is 4 unconstitutionally vague. A court couldn't then, in a 5 civil RICO case, adopt that same standard, say that is 6 the predicate crime and impose treble damages. It would 7 be incoherent to tell the lower courts that what you do 8 is take a statute that would be unconstitutional there 9 and import it into the civil context and uphold it as 10 constitutional here. 11 Let me give you a very practical reason on 12 the facts of this case. So in this case, Mr. Dimaya 13 gets deported on the ground that the statute is 14 sufficiently clear and he is an aggravated felon. He 15 then comes back to the United States the next day and 16 can be -- and will be prosecuted as an aggravated felon. 17 But as an aggravated felon, there will be a different 18 standard and he can't be prosecuted. It would make no 19 sense to have a scheme where the same words that use the 20 same statutory definition mean something in one context, 21 as this Court would hold hypothetically in this case, 22 but in the 16(b) context when it -- or in the context of 23 the definition of a crime means something else. 24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with 25 Leocal? I mean, one thing is clear. The Court did say
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 that burglary is the classic crime. It fits within

44

2 16(b).

3 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, two things to say

4 about that statement in Leocal, which was obviously -- I

5 mean this Court -- Leocal burglary was not before this

6 Court. The first is this is a California burglary,

7 which looks very different, as this Court held in

8 Descamps, from a normal burglary. California burglary

9 can be committed by being invited into someone's home

10 with the intention of selling them fraudulent

11 securities. That is an actual case that applied it in

12 that way.

13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why this case

14 didn't work under 16(a) and the elements, right?

15 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's correct, Your Honor.

16 And then you bring me to another point that's really

17 important. Mr. Kneedler never answered Justice Kagan's

18 question about under the government's current view of

19 what 16(b) means where the space is between the elements

20 clause and the residual clause.

21 I'm actually having trouble coming up with

22 an example of a situation of a -- of a scenario in which

23 a crime does not satisfy the elements clause, because

24 there is no element that requires the use or threat or

25 attempt to use force, but on the other hand,

45 1 quote/unquote, "by its nature, requires the use of force 2 the moment you finish satisfying" -3 JUSTICE KAGAN: He says burglary is that. 4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Burglary can't be that. A 5 burglary is committed the moment after you cross the 6 threshold. And by the way, in California, it doesn't 7 have to be an unlicensed crossing of the threshold. So 8 a burglary is -- is committed when you cross the 9 threshold, even if you're crossing the threshold 10 lawfully. 11 JUSTICE KAGAN: If I understood what he was 12 saying, and I won't try to put words in his mouth, but 13 it was something along the lines that, yes, it's true 14 that the elements of burglary do not have the use of 15 force. But if we look back to the historic 16 understanding of burglary, what we find is a 17 longstanding concern with exactly that subject. In 18 other words, that burglary wouldn't have been defined as 19 it was, wouldn't have been prosecuted as it was, except 20 for this fear of the use of force. I don't know. And 21 that's the best I can do with it and he will tell me if 22 he can do better. 23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, I can't do 24 any better. That sounds like the ordinary case 25 approach, which creates the mischief when you layer on

2 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the principle of

3 law that led to A.B. Small? No one thinks statutory

4 words in the civil context, "unjust or unreasonable

5 rates," whether enforced by courts against railroads, or

6 whether enforced by an agency, is unconstitutional. No

7 one thinks that. A.B. Small holds that, but it holds

8 that in the context of there having been an earlier case

9 that struck those words down in criminal context.

10 So what is the principle of law that it

11 stands for?

12 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the principle

13 of law that A.B. Small stands for that I was arguing

14 specifically, is the principle of law that when a court

15 strikes a statute that Congress has made the decision to

16 impose civil and criminal consequences to, that statute

17 is gone and you don't start preserving the civil

18 consequences to it, because Congress made the decision

19 and we just follow Congress's direction.

20 I do want to close with one last point,

21 which is about the practical consequences of this

22 ruling. First, I already said, in the criminal context,

23 the practical consequences are very limited, because as

24 this Court observed in Johnson, practically all of the

25 applications of 16(b) are applied to a concrete set of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
47 1 facts. Then the question becomes what, in light -- what 2 of the notion that this Court has not decided a lot of 3 16(b) cases, should this Court try to engage in the same 4 exercise in the 16(b) context that was a failure in the 5 ACCA -- in the ACCA context. 6 But in deciding whether to take that route, 7 this Court has to decide what is to be gained by that 8 enterprise. The enterprise of setting the lower courts 9 adrift in -- of considering the risks of the use of 10 force from statutes that do not have use of force as 11 an -- as an element. 12 At some point this Court is going to have to 13 decide whether it's had enough. And it's not like we 14 don't know where this case is headed, where the -- where 15 this inquiry is headed. 16 Justice Kagan unveiled all of the next sets 17 of questions. They are all coming here. We've seen 18 this show before. We know how it ends, so the Court may 19 as well save itself and the lower courts the grief of 20 trying to -21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what's coming here? 22 The -- you said that the lower courts are all confused, 23 and there are splits developing. What? 24 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sykes redux is headed to 25 this Court. After Sykes will be a James redux, a

2 If you look at our brief with the list of

3 examples of circuit conflicts, they are all coming here.

4 Or the National Immigration Project's brief cites

5 another five circuit conflicts. They are all coming to

6 this Court, and the -- this Court will be overwhelmed

7 with the exercise of trying to figure out what the

8 ordinary case of each of those thousands of statutes is,

9 just as it was overwhelmed and finally gave up the

10 exercise in -- in Johnson.

11 So we know that it's coming. We know where

12 it's going to end. So this Court should just end it

13 here and it should end it now.

14 Thank you, Your Honors.

17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19 MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20 First, we explained in our opening brief and

21 reply brief that there is simply not the disarray that

22 there was with respect to the ACCA residual clause.

23 This Court has considered one case in the 30 years --

24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's if you

25 concentrate on us, but I did read those portions of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
49 1 Respondent's brief and the amici brief, and it does seem 2 like we are going to have a redux Sykes and a redux 3 James and a redux many of the issues. 4 MR. KNEEDLER: As -- as we -- as we explain 5 in our brief, the -- the conflicts that -- that we 6 address there can be explained by the differences in the 7 state statutes. And that's what you have, you have to 8 apply the -- the statutory standard of creating a risk 9 to particular state statutes, and as we explain, the -10 the conflicts that they assert are largely that. 11 But if -- if I could then go on. Leocal is 12 the only case this Court considered and the court there 13 considered it clear that it was able to say that DUI was 14 in and -- burglary was in, DUI was out, and that's 15 because of the -- of the sort of textual differences 16 between this statute and that one. It requires not some 17 injury down the road, but physical force actually being 18 used -- a risk of physical force actually being used by 19 the defendant -20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There were some -21 MR. KNEEDLER: -- in the offense. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There were some who 23 argued in the drunken driving test that the minute you 24 get behind the car, you -- drunk, you're using a lethal 25 weapon, a car, to inflict injury on others.

50 1 MR. KNEEDLER: But the -- the Court -2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Didn't win here, but 3 that argument was still being made in the courts below 4 and some courts below bought it. 5 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, but -- but the -- but 6 the important point is this Court clarified it in -- in 7 Leocal to say that you -- it's an act -- it's a category 8 of active violent crimes. Risk of -- of -- of physical 9 force or actual physical force under 16(a). 10 And again, burglary, this Court said -- and 11 burglary is a continuing offense. While you might be 12 able to prosecute somebody for burglary the moment they 13 enter, burglary -- this -- generic burglary, as this 14 Court said in Taylor, includes remaining in the house, 15 and -- and this Court said it's -- it's not made up, 16 that this Court said burglary is included because by its 17 nature it involves a substantial risk that the burglar 18 will use force against a victim in completing a crime. 19 The same thing is true of kidnapping. You 20 can kidnap somebody by inveigling, but the -- the risk 21 of force is that it'll try to escape and you'll have to 22 use physical force. 23 So the -- I don't think the Court is at sea. 24 It can -- it can look at what the -- the state statute 25 is driving at and -- and apply the standard.

51 1 Many -- also many statutes have civil and 2 criminal applications, but that doesn't mean private 3 litigants can invoke the criminal law standard. 4 A. B. Small, when the Court got to the civil 5 context, it said there was no intelligible standard, 6 which -- which -- which was a much more relaxed 7 standard. 8 Finally on the immigration, immigration is 9 vested in an administrative agency, so there is always 10 the -- the intervening action by the executive, and even 11 in the situation where the agency may not get deference, 12 there is still a centralized control over the bringing 13 of the cases. And the Board of Immigration Appeals can 14 say, this is out, this is in. The courts will only see 15 the cases where the BIA actually sustains the removal, 16 but that has a way of limiting giving -- and giving 17 notice to people. 18 With respect to -- I'm sorry. 19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 20 The case is submitted. 21 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 22 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 23 24 25
