3 1 PROCEEDINGS 2 (10:03 a.m.) 3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 4 this morning in Case 15-9260, Dean v. United States. 5 Mr. Stoler. 6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER 7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 8 MR. STOLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 9 please the Court: 10 The question confronting this Court is 11 whether a judge can exercise discretion at sentencing in 12 light of congressional directives in Section 924(c) that 13 a 30-year mandatory minimum must be imposed as part of 14 the total sentence. 15 Throughout the Sentencing Reform Act, in the 16 myriad of factors set forth for a judge to consider at 17 arriving at an aggregate sentence that meets the 18 overarching goals of being sufficient, but not greater 19 than necessary. And we submit that there's nothing in 20 the language of Section 924(c) that prevents the judge 21 from reducing the portion of the sentence for crimes of 22 violence. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't have -24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We don't doubt that 25 if the -- the mandatory minimums were out of the picture

1 and all we had was the underlying offense here, that

4

2 this sentence would be reversed on appeal, do you?

3 MR. STOLER: I would -- I would submit, yes.

4 That would -- that would be accurate, Your Honor.

5 But in addition --

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said nothing in

7 924(c), but there is a bar on concurrent sentencing.

8 And reading the statute the way you do would shrink the

9 concurrency to the vanishing point if we add only one

10 day to the 924(c) sentence.

11 MR. STOLER: Well, the concurrent provision

12 requires that it does not -- it runs in addition to the

13 predicate offense. But the concurrent language in there

14 is the same language that we would find, for example, in

15 Section 1028A of the statutes, which has that same

16 language, but it goes farther. When you look at the

17 language in 1028A, it follows the same roadmap that

18 924(c) has.

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's 20 years later,

20 right?

21 MR. STOLER: It's 20 years later, but -- but

22 924(c) has -- has been recalibrated over time starting

23 in 1968. And even after 1028A came into existence in

24 two separate times, Congress has changed provisions

25 in 10 -- excuse me in 924(c) to change the types of

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But just --

3 MR. STOLER: -- and things of that nature.

4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Just assume the 1028 for a

5 moment didn't exist and say you had to argue from this

6 language, and this essentially repeats Justice

7 Ginsburg's point, but this language says, "It shall run

8 consecutively, it shall not run concurrently." And your

9 version of this statute essentially allows a district

10 court to negate that language. It's as if that language

11 were not there in terms of what the -- the -- the

12 district court can do.

13 MR. STOLER: Well, we -- we submit that the

14 district court has to give some sentence for the

15 underlying crimes of violence, and then they --

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, "some sentence," you

17 know, a day, six hours, whatever it is, but can

18 essentially make that -- that disappear. I mean, you

19 know, it's concurrent plus a day. I mean, that couldn't

20 have been what Congress meant, concurrent plus a day,

21 when it said, "It shall only be consecutive."

22 MR. STOLER: Well, Congress, we assume,

23 knows how to write the laws that they write. And they

24 have the ability to strictly limit -- and they have in

25 924(c) to some extent, as far as it having to be --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
6 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you're right. The 2 Congress did not say you -- it did not say what it said, 3 in fact, in 1028A. But, you know, sometimes, sometimes 4 the way we try to understand statutes is to say any 5 reading that utterly eviscerates something that Congress 6 clearly did say can't be a good reading. 7 MR. STOLER: Well, we would submit that the 8 "in addition to" language is making sure that a separate 9 crime is being separately punished, that being the 10 924(c) crimes that carry the mandatory minimums, in this 11 case of 30 years. But the -- the language that -- that 12 says consecutive also is -- is meant to say that -- that 13 it can't run with those -- those nine -- those 14 underlying predicate offenses. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, during the time 16 the guidelines were mandatory, but afterwards, many, 17 many court of appeals basically told district courts you 18 can't impose a sentence simply because you disagree with 19 the guideline. You can impose it for independent 20 reasons to ensure a just result, but you can't impose it 21 merely because you don't like the guideline. And they 22 monitored that pretty well. 23 That's basically what -- this district court 24 didn't say it didn't like the mandatory minimum. It 25 said instead that it thought a fair sentence was, and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
7 1 that -- that would have been one day, if it could have 2 done it, given that the rest of the sentence, 30 years, 3 was even further beyond what the judge thought was 4 adequate for punishment, deterrence, and all the other 5 factors under 3553, correct? 6 MR. STOLER: Correct. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not negating 8 Congress's purpose if a district court gives one day; 9 correct? 10 MR. STOLER: I would -- I would say not, no. 11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And one day is a day of 12 punishment, isn't it? 13 MR. STOLER: No question as to that, Your 14 Honor. Yes. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that your point? 16 MR. STOLER: Basically it is that. And the 17 -- we also have to take into consideration you have the 18 parsimony guideline -- or requirement that pervades the 19 whole Sentencing Reform Act. We find in it 3551. We 20 find it twice in 3553A that the parsimony provisions are 21 what's considered as to the total sentence. 22 And when you look at the factors that are 23 set forth within 3553A, within 3551, which talks about 24 the circumstances of the case, in -- in 3661, which says 25 there's no limitation as to what can be considered by a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
8 1 court in determining an appropriate sentence. In light 2 of that parsimony requirement, that ends up in the 3 results that we have. 4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is the -- 924(c) is 5 a statute, it's nothing to do with the guidelines, and 6 it does say sentences have to be consecutive. So I go 7 back to the point I opened with. You are, in effect, 8 asking for a concurrent sentence. 9 MR. STOLER: Well, just -- just -10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just adding one day. 11 MR. STOLER: Well, as Justice Kagan and I 12 discussed, one day is an additional punishment. And one 13 day -14 JUSTICE KAGAN: She's Justice Sotomayor. 15 MR. STOLER: I'm sorry. Wrong end. 16 (Laughter.) 17 JUSTICE KAGAN: She was the one helping you. 18 (Laughter.) 19 MR. STOLER: I'm sorry. 20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is the -21 JUSTICE KAGAN: I was the one who wasn't. 22 (Laughter.) 23 MR. STOLER: I got my ends mixed up. I'm 24 sorry. 25 But as was -- as was indicated, that is an
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
9 1 additional sentence. That is additional punishment that 2 is provided for according to the statutory provisions. 3 924(c) limits as to it having to be a consecutive 4 sentence, in this case 30 years, but it does not tell as 5 to the underlying crime of violence predicate 6 offenses -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that 8 you -9 MR. STOLER: -- to which is something that 10 should be decided. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you 12 have to concede that your position completely negates 13 the -- or can completely negate the effect of 924, but 14 that there are other reasons why Congress probably would 15 have allowed that. And I suppose that's 3553 to take 16 into account all of those factors. 17 So you're saying, basically, that 3553 18 overrides 924(c), but that -- that -- that's hard to 19 read the statute that way. 20 MR. STOLER: And I'm not -- I'm not 21 suggesting that it should be read that way. I think 22 that they're -- they're read together. But 924(c) does 23 have restrictions that require the "in addition to" 24 language and it requires it be consecutive. But there's 25 no way -- there's nothing in 924(c) that limits what the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
10 1 Court can determine as to the predicate offenses as to 2 those crimes of violence. 3 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that you were -- I 4 thought that your answer to the Chief Justice was 5 perhaps telling, because you said that you thought that 6 were it not for 924(c), this would be an unreasonable 7 sentence under -- under 3551 and 3553. 8 Isn't -- wasn't that your answer? 9 MR. STOLER: Yes. 10 JUSTICE ALITO: And doesn't that show that 11 Congress, although it generally conferred on district 12 courts the authority under those provisions to determine 13 what is a reasonable sentence in light of the enumerated 14 factors, withdrew that discretion with respect to the 15 component that is covered by 924(c)? 16 So if that's what the -- if that's what 17 Congress was doing, then why shouldn't that entire 18 sentence be ruled out in determining the sentence that 19 is reasonable under the count that is not governed by 20 924(c)? 21 MR. STOLER: Because we don't read 924(c) as 22 being in conflict with -- with 3553(a); you read all the 23 statutes together. And Congress knows -- I believe they 24 know how to -- how to set constraints and set 25 limitations, and they then did so in 924(c) to ensure
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 that a violent crime such as -- as carrying guns in

11

2 commission of a predicate offense is going to carry a

3 long period of sentence and a severe sentence.

4 And they wanted to ensure, if you look at

5 the history of 924(c) and its -- and its evolution, its

6 recalibration over time, it has made it -- I mean, when

7 we first started off in 924(c), there could still be

8 a -- there could still be a suspended sentence or

9 parole. Sentencing Reform Act took those away. So they

10 recalibrated 924(c) to reflect that, and they've done so

11 over time.

12 And they, again, had the -- the ability

13 after 1028A came into existence to say that you can't

14 consider, you can't compensate for, you can't take into

15 account that -- that, in that case, an aggravated

16 identity theft, but that mandatory minimum sentence when

17 you're making a determination as to that underlying

18 crime of violence. They could --

19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about --

20 MR. STOLER: -- have done something; they

21 didn't.

22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about Judge

23 Lucero's point that Congress can do a

24 belt-and-suspenders operation, as if -- that there

25 was -- there was additional insurance in 1028, doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 mean that 924(c) shouldn't be read to have a real

12

2 sentence for the predicate offense?

3 MR. STOLER: We would answer that the -- the

4 Congress had the opportunity to do so, and they didn't

5 do so, when they amended 924(c) at least two times since

6 the advent of 1028A. And it's not a redundancy issue,

7 because there, they went forward and said this is how --

8 they used all the language in 924(c), and they went

9 farther and then put that additional restriction on the

10 sentencing court to make a determination as to the

11 underlying predicate offense that you can't consider

12 that mandatory minimum in doing so.

13 Congress has that ability to do so. They

14 know how to write the laws and they know how to limit

15 sentencing discretion, and they did so to the extent

16 that they did in 924(c).

17 JUSTICE ALITO: And you think that's a

18 realistic -- a realistic assessment of the way a

19 legislative body works? They -- so we put this in

20 924(c). Then we put stronger language in 1028, and now

21 we're amending 924. And, well, maybe we better

22 strengthen 924 to make it in line with 1028.

23 Did they have any reason to think about that

24 at the time when they amended 924?

25 MR. STOLER: We would submit that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 has --

13

2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A circuit court's

3 ruling -- there's at least one, the Tenth, that had

4 ruled in your favor.

5 MR. STOLER: That's correct.

6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Had it done so by the

7 time 924(c) was amended?

8 MR. STOLER: Yes. The decision in Smith

9 came down in 2014. There's also a Sixth Circuit case,

10 United States v. Franklin, that I believe came down in

11 2007 that -- that postdated the changes in 9 -- in

12 1028 --

13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Postdated or predated

14 the changes in 924 --

15 MR. STOLER: Came out -- came out -- it came

16 after the changes.

17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'll pick up

18 Justice Alito's question, then.

19 Is there any indication that Congress was

20 aware of those court of appeals decisions?

21 MR. STOLER: Well, Congress in the past has

22 made changes to 924(c) based upon what courts have done.

23 If we look at the Busic opinion, for example. They --

24 courts had interpreted that there was no requirement for

25 the consecutive or additional sentence, and they went

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
14 1 and they changed 924(c) in -- in response to what this 2 Court had done in Busic. So I submit that the Court -3 that -- that the Congress has that ability. If they do 4 make changes to 924(c) in the future, obviously, that 5 would be in -- in relationship to what they feel is -6 is the appropriate punishments that must be imposed for 7 the crimes that have been committed. 8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How old was your 9 defendant? Do you know? 10 MR. STOLER: He was 24 years old. His -11 his co-defendant brother was 23 years old. That was -12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So he would be 50-odd 13 something? 14 MR. STOLER: He would -- he -- under the 15 current sentence, he would serve more time than he's 16 actually lived. And if he had -17 JUSTICE BREYER: This is something that a 18 direct answer to, because the statutes have changed so 19 quickly that I may have lost track. But the -- but the 20 3553(b) is what I'm looking at, and that talks about 21 departures. And I take it that the sentence for robbery 22 was a departure. The -- the guideline recommendation 23 for -- and you did sentence the judge under the 24 guidelines; correct? 25 MR. STOLER: The judge calculated the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 guidelines, right.

15

2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. He didn't

3 depart from the guidelines. He didn't -- but he did

4 depart from the guideline sentence, which was 48 months

5 or 44 months.

6 MR. STOLER: 40 months in this case --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

8 MR. STOLER: -- Your Honor, yes.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And he went

10 from there to one day.

11 And 3553(b) says you have to -- I don't know

12 if it's still law -- have to impose a guideline sentence

13 unless the court finds there exists here a mitigating

14 circumstance of a kind or to a degree not adequately

15 taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in

16 formulating the guideline.

17 So you'd look and see their guideline says

18 48 months, and they departed down to a day for the

19 reason that there was this add-on sentence, the

20 mandatory.

21 Now, is there anything that suggests that

22 the commission did not have that in -- take that into

23 account? In other words, is it a proper factor for

24 departure, viewed not now from what Congress intended,

25 not viewed from the point of view of the statutes you've

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
16 1 been referring to, but viewed simply from the view of 2 the commission and the Congress as to when you can 3 depart downward? 4 MR. STOLER: Your Honor, I would submit that 5 this is not really a guideline analysis in that the 6 judge made a determination -7 JUSTICE BREYER: No. This is a statute. 8 And the statute says, Judge, if you want to depart 9 downward, you can do so if you're applying the 10 guidelines only for a reason -- the words are, to repeat 11 them, a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree 12 not adequately taken into consideration by the 13 sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines. 14 I'm not giving you an answer. It's not a 15 hostile question; it's not a friendly question. It's a 16 question I'd like to know the answer to. 17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the sentencing 18 judge did depart downward considerably, because the 19 guideline range was -20 MR. STOLER: Yes. 21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- here, as in -22 MR. STOLER: That's right. 23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what was suggested. He 24 departed downward to 40 from -- what was the range? 25 MR. STOLER: It was 84 to 105 months without
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 the -- the enhancement that would be under the

17

2 guidelines if the guns were present.

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it was a

4 significant -- it was a significant departure.

5 MR. STOLER: And he -- he gave various

6 reasons for making that departure, that variance --

7 JUSTICE BREYER: But the basic reason was he

8 thought that the mandatory was long enough.

9 MR. STOLER: Well, he also -- the judge

10 indicated that the -- the reasons he was considering

11 this was the role that he had -- the role that Levon

12 Dean, Jr., had played compared to the role that his

13 brother had played. He determined that based upon his

14 criminal history and the nature of those convictions

15 that he had. He articulated numerous reasons as to the

16 --

17 JUSTICE BREYER: But the basic reason, I

18 think it's fair to say, is he thought the mandatories

19 were long enough.

20 MR. STOLER: If he could -- if he could have

21 gone to --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: Let -- let me assume that

23 then. And it seems to me as if I hadn't thought that

24 through till this moment, and I still haven't, the

25 relation of 50 -- 3553(b). It may be you haven't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
18 1 thought it through either. Maybe nobody has, but -- but 2 I mean -- and maybe there isn't one, but -- but I -- I 3 wanted to learn as much as I could if there is a 4 relevance of that. 5 MR. STOLER: Well, and I looked at the -6 the factors that are set forth under 3553(a), in which 7 the guidelines are one of those factors, the same as 8 policy statements are one of those factors, and they go, 9 I submit, to the overall sentence that the court 10 imposes. And when a judge in this case, it's not a 11 guideline sentence that he's -- he's deciding. He's 12 varying, based upon these 3553(a) factors, those 13 tapestry of factors that the thread of parsimony runs 14 through in which he makes those -- those determinations. 15 Let's look at -- at what those four main 16 tenets of -- of parsimony are. For example, the term -17 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I know 3553(a). That 18 isn't a problem for me. 19 What I'm trying to think of is maybe this is 20 a matter that lies in the hands of the commission. 21 Maybe you could say, well, the commission didn't say you 22 couldn't depart for that reason and, therefore, it is a 23 factor, a mitigating factor not considered by the 24 commission, but maybe the commission, should it choose 25 to do so, could consider it and could say when it could
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 and when it couldn't be, in which case the judge

19

2 couldn't depart downward. You see, that -- that's --

3 that's what's going through my mind and there's no point

4 repeating myself. You thought -- you might have thought

5 about it, you might not have. It's a little bit of a

6 side issue.

7 MR. STOLER: Well, I -- I -- I'd like to

8 think I've thought about it from the context of -- of

9 looking at the guidelines as a -- as a starting point

10 and as a -- as a determination that helps to -- to guide

11 a court to consider sentencing. But it's just a factor

12 for the Court to consider, and the overall factors that

13 are set forth in 3553(a), as well as 3661, as well as

14 3551, leads us to consider all of those factors in

15 determining what total sentence should be imposed in

16 this case.

17 The court varied in this instance based upon

18 what he found the guidelines to be, but then there's

19 additional things that he considered, those factors that

20 he looked at to make the determination as to what would

21 be the appropriate sentence to impose on -- on -- on the

22 Petitioner in this case.

23 And any -- any total sentence is obviously

24 subject to appellate review for substantial -- for

25 substantive reasonableness under abuse of discretion

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 stand -- standpoint. So the government, if in this

20

2 instance, felt that the court could then impose a

3 sentence of -- of one day with the additional 30 years,

4 the mandatory minimums required, and the government felt

5 that that was not a substantive -- substantively

6 reasonable sentence, that's still subject to review by

7 the appellate courts.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how does that

9 normally work, not in a mandatory minimum way, but if

10 you've got three different offenses and -- and you're

11 going to be sentenced on each of them? On appellate

12 review, how is that reviewed? Is it the total sentence

13 or do they go by one -- one, two, and three and say, we

14 think you abused your discretion in only giving, you

15 know, five months for this and then that doesn't affect

16 the three years you gave for that. How -- how does that

17 actually happen?

18 MR. STOLER: I -- my understanding is that

19 the -- the -- the appellate review is based upon the

20 reasonableness of the total sentence that's imposed.

21 Now, if there is a portion of that sentence that -- that

22 the court felt that the -- that it wasn't dealt with

23 properly by the sentencing court, then they would

24 address that either for clear error in -- in what was

25 looked at and how the guidelines were applied or de novo

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 as to the applications of the guidelines themselves.

21

2 So there are those -- those considerations

3 to be made from appellate review standpoint, but the

4 over -- overriding consideration, I would submit, would

5 be the substantive reasonableness for abuse of

6 discretion.

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In first looking at this

8 case, my thought was that it would be very difficult for

9 the judge to determine what the sentence should be for

10 the underlying crime without looking at what he was

11 require -- or he or she was required to do under 924.

12 But then it occurred to me that judges and lawyers do

13 this all the time. We -- we think of a hypothetical

14 case.

15 Suppose 924 did not exist. What sentence

16 would I give? Judges do this all the time in

17 condemnation cases. We don't look at the value of the

18 improvement. We -- we -- we can look at a problem in --

19 in an abstract way. So I think nothing that prevents

20 the judge from making the -- quite a proper

21 determination for the underlying offense and said --

22 then saying, but looking at the statute, it has to be

23 consecutive and the consecutive sentence has been -- the

24 length of the consecutive sentence has been set forth.

25 So I -- I see nothing analytically difficult about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 government's position.

22

2 MR. STOLER: Well, that -- I -- I submit,

3 Your Honor, that -- that turns around the determination

4 to be made. The independence -- the -- the separate

5 crime, the separate punishment goes to 924(c). It has

6 to happen. I mean, it has to be put on to that. But

7 the -- the consideration overall as to the underlying

8 crimes of violence still lends itself to -- to

9 discretion by the sentencing --

10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's -- that's --

11 that's --

12 MR. STOLER: Keep that in mind --

13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the question before

14 us.

15 MR. STOLER: And I -- and I believe the --

16 the Court in Smith, United States v. Smith, the Tenth

17 Circuit case that we're relying upon, talks about that.

18 You -- you can't have judges having blinders to look at

19 just the underlying crimes of violence and then -- then

20 doing so as the government is suggesting in this case --

21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you couldn't under

22 1028A.

23 MR. STOLER: But 1028A has the additional

24 requirement.

25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you said you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
23 1 can't have this, but you can if we interpret the statute 2 the way the government wants. 3 MR. STOLER: My argument is that the -- the 4 Congress could have written the statute to include what 5 they included in 1028A. They didn't do so in this 6 instance. 7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, in terms of that 8 analytical difficulty, there is inherent in this scheme 9 a bit of double -- a lot of double counting, because the 10 substantive crimes almost always, in trying to judge the 11 severity of punishment for that, you're always thinking 12 of the gun, and -- and that always adds to whatever 13 analytically separate punishment you think should be 14 given for the substantive crime. 15 So there is a little bit of twisting of a 16 judge by saying you have to somehow put yourself in the 17 position of punishing this person without knowing that 18 he's going to be punished for the gun anyway for 30 19 years, and think of what the punishment should be 20 without that punishment. Because the gun is present in 21 both crimes, correct? 22 MR. STOLER: Yes. 23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The identity theft 24 add-ons, one is -- for every crime except terrorism is 25 only two years, correct?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
24 1 MR. STOLER: Correct, the aggravated 2 identity theft. 3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And in many ways it's 4 punishing for a separate activity than merely the 5 possession of identity theft items. 6 MR. STOLER: Well, there are -- listed 7 within the statute are the specified crimes that it 8 would apply to, yes. 9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. So the five 10 years is for the terrorism. 11 MR. STOLER: In -- in those -- in those 12 instances, yes. I -- I would agree -- I would agree 13 with that, Your Honor. 14 If there are no further questions, I would 15 ask to leave to -- have the rest of my time for 16 rebuttal. 17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 18 MR.

Alderson Reporting Company

1 felonies, that Petitioner now concedes would be

25

2 unreasonable without the 924(c). Accepting his position

3 would directly circumvent 924(c)'s longstanding

4 requirement that courts would impose a specified

5 additional and consecutive sentence beyond the

6 punishment for the predicate solely for the choice to

7 bring a gun.

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It -- it would

9 circumvent it. On the other hand, it seems to me that

10 if you're talking about 30 years for an offense that a

11 judge thinks merits a lot less, if Congress wanted to

12 prevent circumvention, they should have written the law

13 a lot more carefully.

14 MR. YANG: Well, I think it's true that

15 Congress could have written it more clearly, but we

16 think that Congress here, when you take a look at both

17 the provisions of 924(c) and then read them in

18 conjunction with the provisions of the Sentencing Reform

19 Act makes sufficiently clear Congress's intent that --

20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure -- I'm

21 not sure "sufficiently clear" is enough. I think maybe

22 "indisputably clear."

23 I mean, in your -- in your brief you quote,

24 to be fair, that -- that this is contrary to the thrust

25 of 924(c), and I'm not sure when you're talking about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 this amount of punishment a -- a thrust is enough.

26

2 MR. YANG: Well, if --

3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Congress doesn't

4 pass thrusts, they pass language, and there's nothing in

5 the language that prevents the judge from imposing a

6 sentence recognizing that the defendant faces 30 years

7 already.

8 MR. YANG: I agree that thrusts are not a

9 thing. We -- we were quoting the --

10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know what you're

11 quoting.

12 MR. YANG: -- the decision in Abbott. But

13 the Court's decision in Abbot also says that the

14 language compels the imposition of an additional -- and

15 I believe this is on 25 of the opinion, this is a

16 unanimous opinion of the Court.

17 And I think the Court recognized that when

18 you look at 924(c), it -- particularly when you look at

19 the drafting history, from 1971 onward where Congress

20 was taking step after step after step to restrict the

21 sentencing instructions --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't say --

23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's --

24 JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't say it anywhere.

25 This is not taken into account by the commission, unless

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
27 1 you can tell me there's a guideline on this particular 2 application of the mandatory minimum. And the statute 3 and the guidelines both say a judge can depart for a 4 reason not taken adequately into consideration by the 5 commission. 6 So unless you can point to me someplace 7 where they take this into consideration, although they 8 might in the future, I would say they didn't take it 9 into consideration at all. 10 MR. YANG: I -- I think the -11 JUSTICE BREYER: And therefore the language 12 allows it. The language allows it, and indeed the 13 theory allows it, because the theory is you could have a 14 person there who's convicted of 19 multiple counts, you 15 know, and -- and the judge is given considerable power 16 to work all this out so that you have overall a fair 17 sentence. All right? That's the whole argument. 18 So what's your response? 19 MR. YANG: Well, I guess to the whole 20 argument, we have a few responses. 21 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you do. 22 MR. YANG: But -- but I think -- first of 23 all, on the -- on the guidelines point, the guidelines 24 have taken this into account since the very beginning 25 when you were on the Sentencing Commission.
Alderson Reporting Company

1 JUSTICE BREYER: Where?

28

2 MR. YANG: Well --

3 JUSTICE BREYER: Where did you take this?

4 Where.

5 MR. YANG: Well, the guidelines specifically

6 address in Section 2K2.4, comment note 4, they talk

7 about how you -- and as well as in Chapter 5 about

8 determining a total sentence based on aggregate

9 sentences, multiple terms of imprisonment. The

10 guidelines said that what you do with the predicate is

11 you determine the predicate under the guidelines, but

12 you don't include the specific offense --

13 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's --

14 MR. YANG: -- characteristic of --

15 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's --

16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm going to

17 let you get back to a fuller answer to Justice Breyer.

18 But that certainly cuts against you, the idea that they

19 recognize that, yes, you do have to look to the

20 mandatory minimums. You should take that into account

21 in imposing the sentence. And now you say when it gets

22 down to what the actual sentence is, you can't look at

23 the mandatory minimums at all.

24 MR. YANG: I don't think it cuts against us,

25 as in -- in we're going to have multiple discussions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 about these various factors.

29

2 First, I don't think the guidelines shed a

3 lot of light on the statutory question here. If you

4 were to disagree with our understanding of the

5 guidelines, that would not mean that the statute's

6 wrong; it means that the guidelines would have to give

7 way. We are defending the commentary in the guidelines,

8 which, again, have existed since the very beginning.

9 JUSTICE BREYER: You look at 2.4. I missed

10 it. Where -- where is the place on --

11 MR. YANG: 2K2.4, comment note 4. And --

12 and then subsequently, this is also cited in our brief

13 back in the pages around the 40s when we discussed the

14 guidelines.

15 But about the guidelines in the statute, the

16 guidelines would have to give way. And we are defending

17 the commentary because we think, not only have this

18 commentary been around since 1987 when the guidelines

19 were first sent to Congress, and had since been there,

20 we think this is a sensible distinction between the

21 conduct that the court considers when determining the

22 sentencing of the predicate, and knowing that the

23 conduct is accounted for separately in the 924(c), and

24 considering the total aggregate sentence. That is

25 something different.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
30 1 Congress specified where courts look to the 2 total aggregate sentence in Section 3584. In Section 3 3584, Congress said, "When there are multiple terms of 4 imprisonment, the court shall, with respect to each 5 offense, consider the 3554 -- 3553A factors when 6 deciding whether to make the total sentence by making 7 them concurrent or consecutive." 8 But we know that Section 924(c) wholly 9 removed that power. And in doing so, it removed the 10 power of the court to tailor the total aggregate 11 sentence, which is a power that was set to -12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the government must 13 recognize that 924(c) can influence the sentence on the 14 predicate offense because -- I think I'm correct in 15 saying the government takes the position if 924(c) drops 16 out if it's not proved, then when it goes back to the 17 district court -18 MR. YANG: Right. 19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the district court can 20 enlarge the original sentence for the predicate offense. 21 MR. YANG: And because we think -- and this 22 is what happens in -- in courts, courts are applying the 23 guidelines. And the guideline says when you're 24 calculating the sentence for the predicate, you ignore 25 the offense conduct with respect to the gun because we
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 don't want to double-count it. But if you drop the

31

2 924(c), it should -- it should go back for the court to

3 consider the offense conduct as it considers the -- the

4 -- the sentence for the predicate.

5 This is a --

6 JUSTICE BREYER: Where? Where? I mean,

7 I -- my quick reading of 4, I promise I didn't memorize

8 the guidelines. I used to know them pretty well, but I

9 don't know them perfectly, by any means, and never did.

10 But it seems to me that comment 4 in 2K2.4

11 is saying that -- that defendant, you have committed a

12 crime, and in our guideline as punishment for the crime,

13 part of it is increased because you had a gun. And so

14 if we're going to apply the mandatory over here, which

15 is our special statute here, don't apply that. But I

16 don't see anything there that says you can't subtract.

17 MR. YANG: Well, when you go to 5G1.2, which

18 governs the total sentence, the -- when you have

19 multiple offenses with terms of imprisonment, it says

20 you -- you calculate the total sentence with respect to

21 the non-924(c)'s and then you tack on --

22 JUSTICE BREYER: 5G?

23 MR. YANG: 1.2, I believe. This is

24 addressed in pages --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: Right --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
32 1 MR. YANG: I think around page 42 of our 2 brief. 43. Nope. 42. 3 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I'll find it. 4 MR. YANG: So the -- the point is the -5 this is the way that the guidelines have been applied, 6 and they were applied, in fact, in this way in this 7 case. The district court calculated the sentencing 8 guidelines range, which is 84 to 105 months, based on 9 the guidelines. 10 No one is disputing that's what the 11 guidelines required. In fact, they conceded that that 12 was the proper guideline sentence in district court. 13 And then the district court then varied downward, and I 14 think the provision that you're talking about, about 15 3553(b) -16 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Yeah. 17 MR. YANG: -- part of that was, of course, 18 rendered inoperative under -19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Yeah. That's -20 MR. YANG: -- under Booker -- Booker. And 21 then -- and what the court did here is a post-Booker 22 thing, vary. It's not a technical departure, it's a 23 variance because he is applying -24 JUSTICE BREYER: No. He varied here. He 25 varied.
Alderson Reporting Company

33 1 MR. YANG: He varied. He varied down to 40 2 months. And then he additionally said, if I had 3 discretion, I'd go down to one day because I think 30 4 years is enough. But that is essentially a -- just a 5 disagreement with the policy judgment. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: No. And that's harder for 7 you. It's harder for you, because after all, if it's a 8 variance, he's not applying the guidelines. If he's not 9 applying the guidelines, all this stuff in the 10 guidelines that supports you is out the window. And -11 and -- including the sentence I read. And if it's out 12 the window, all we're trying to do is back where we 13 started, is the statute -- does the statute, which 14 doesn't mention this, forbid it, or is it otherwise 15 unfair? 16 MR. YANG: Well, I would, I guess -- first 17 of all, we're not relying on the -18 JUSTICE BREYER: My fault, not your fault. 19 MR. YANG: We're not relying on the 20 guidelines as an affirmative. We just wanted to point 21 out in our brief we think the guidelines are consistent. 22 JUSTICE KAGAN: But what are you suggesting 23 ought to happen? I mean, presumably, the guidelines 24 reflect an idea that there shouldn't be any 25 double-counting of the gun, right? So what does -- how
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
34 1 does the court do the -- the sentence on the underlying 2 crime, taking away the fact of the gun? 3 In other words, most robberies have guns in 4 them, and the sentences are written to reflect that they 5 have guns in them, don't they? Aren't they? 6 MR. YANG: No, actually. The guidelines 7 take into account things like Hobbs Act robbery and 8 separately account for the gun with a two-level 9 enhancement. And so the guidelines range, when you 10 commit a Hobbs Act robbery without a gun, will just be 11 the standard Hobbs Act robbery range. 12 Now, there are going to be other offense 13 characteristics if you injure someone or -- you know, 14 these things can affect -15 JUSTICE KAGAN: What you think ought to 16 happen is that the -- is that the judge should say, 17 okay, imagine a robbery without a gun, what would be a 18 reasonable sentence for that. 19 MR. YANG: I think the judge should do -20 take into account what judges normally do under a real 21 offense sentencing approach, which is you look at the 22 offense conduct, you look at the history and 23 characteristics of the defender -24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, offense conduct, does 25 that mean without a gun?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
35 1 MR. YANG: But -- but without the gun. We 2 say -- we think the judge has discretion, ultimately, to 3 either consider it with the gun or -- or not because 4 Congress hasn't expressly prohibited that. But the 5 guidelines approach, which we think is permissible, is 6 to consider it; you consider it without the gun and then 7 you -- the reason for that is the guidelines say 8 Congress has separately provided -- remember, the 9 legislative history, I think, there are -- Senator 10 Mansfield, that kind of was the -- the main proponent of 11 the relevant text, the very stringent sentencing 12 provisions, made clear that the whole purpose of this 13 was to impose this additional sentence and require 14 additional time in prison solely for the choice to use 15 the gun, so the guidelines -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that's an 17 excerpt from the legislative history that, it seems to 18 me, is unimportant in light of what 3553 says. 3553(a) 19 says, you know, well, that the judge at the end of the 20 day has to consider the need for the sentence imposed to 21 reflect the serious of the offense and so forth. And -22 MR. YANG: But the 3553 -23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me you're 24 asking us to say that 924(c) really supersedes 3553. 25 MR. YANG: No. What we say is 3553 doesn't
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 apply on its own terms. It doesn't apply on its own

36

2 terms. If you look through the Sentencing Reform Act,

3 there are at least nine provisions, all of which, when

4 you're looking at them, fine or imprisonment or

5 probation or whatever it might be, the court -- the

6 provision says, the court shall, in setting this

7 sentence, consider the 3553(a) factors.

8 In addition, with respect to multiple terms

9 of imprisonment -- and this is on page -- I believe it's

10 5A of our -- excuse me -- 11A of our appendix. If you

11 look at 3584(b), it says, "The court, in determining

12 whether terms imposed to be" -- "are to be ordered

13 concurrently or consecutively, shall consider for each

14 offense" -- remember, this is multiple offenses -- "each

15 offense for which a term of imprisonment is being

16 imposed the factors set forth in 3553(a)."

17 So, normally, what happens is the courts

18 will determine individual sentences. So you could have

19 a sentence of seven years and a sentence of another

20 seven years, and then maybe one is capped at five. And

21 then the court says, I've got these individual

22 sentences. I sentence for each offense. What's the

23 total sentence? You could make that five and seven and

24 seven. You could make it 19. Or you could just make it

25 seven. It depends on whether you make them consecutive

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 or concurrent.

37

2 So the question about the total imprisonment

3 when you have multiple terms of -- of -- with multiple

4 offenses with terms of imprisonment is 3554(b) affects

5 that, and it says that's where you apply the 3553(a)

6 factors to determine the total length. But Congress

7 took that power away. Congress took that power away

8 totally in 924(c) by directing that you cannot do that.

9 You must impose them consecutively.

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well that's where I don't

11 understand your -- your answer to Justice Kennedy,

12 because you said, no, you're not saying that 924

13 supersedes 3553. I think you have to be saying that.

14 You might still be right, but you have to be saying that

15 there's this background principle, which is 3553, which

16 is this parsimony principle and all these factors, and

17 then 924 comes along and says, but not here.

18 MR. YANG: I guess in a sense we are saying

19 that, but I don't think it -- it operates directly on

20 3553(a), because I don't think 3553(a) operates as a

21 freestanding -- freestanding provision. It comes into

22 play at various points in the Sentencing Reform Act

23 where the court -- the Congress has said, you consider

24 these factors in making this determination. In

25 setting -- deciding whether to set on the amount of a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 fine, you look at the 35 --

38

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: One way you might look at

3 this, and this goes back to what the Chief Justice said,

4 he said, well, when there's a 30-year sentence

5 implicated, you better be pretty clear. And also when

6 you're legislating against a fairly strong background

7 principle of 3553, you better be pretty clear that

8 you're displacing that background principle.

9 MR. YANG: But the --

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: And here, you're just not --

11 you just have not been clear enough. You were clear

12 enough in 1028(a). We know what that looks like. But

13 here, you just haven't been clear enough to upset this

14 background presumption.

15 MR. YANG: We think that it's clear enough

16 because 3553(a) applies by -- when you -- for purposes

17 of setting the total term of imprisonment, the only

18 reason 3553(a) applies is because Congress provided that

19 they are to be considered in 3584(b) in setting the

20 consecutive or concurrent sentence. And so that has

21 been removed. That has been removed.

22 If it were true that 3553(a) just generally

23 was a free-floating provision that applied everywhere,

24 then all the nine provisions of the Sentencing Reform

25 Act that specifically say you must consider the 353 --

Alderson Reporting Company

1 53 factors with respect to these specific types of

39

2 sentences would be superfluous.

3 JUSTICE ALITO: If this case had arisen

4 before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted, I -- I

5 think that Dean's argument would certainly be correct,

6 would it not?

7 MR. YANG: I think we would have a more

8 difficult --

9 JUSTICE ALITO: The judge would have

10 complied with the statute, the term wasn't consecutive,

11 and other than that, it was discretionary. So it was

12 completely within the judge's discretion.

13 MR. YANG: I think what we would have to

14 argue in that case is that the Congress would have known

15 that the traditional place that judges determine the

16 aggregate length of a sentence, when there are multiple

17 offenses carrying terms of imprisonment, is in the

18 determination that -- of whether the sentences run

19 concurrently or consecutively.

20 JUSTICE ALITO: At a minimum, you would have

21 had a very tough argument. On the other hand, if this

22 case had arisen before we decided Booker, if you read

23 the guidelines correctly -- and it does seem to be --

24 they do seem to say what you say they say -- then you

25 would clearly be correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

40

2 JUSTICE ALITO: So we're in this kind of

3 weird -- we're -- we're in this weird world that this

4 Court has created where the guidelines are advisory, but

5 then they're not advisory, and so that's why we have

6 this problem; is that correct?

7 MR. YANG: Well --

8 JUSTICE ALITO: You don't want to say that

9 because --

10 (Laughter.)

11 JUSTICE ALITO: -- nobody but me would agree

12 with you.

13 MR. YANG: We -- we -- we obviously accept

14 Booker as the proper interpretation of the law -- of the

15 Constitution. But I think what I would say is that the

16 guidelines -- there might be a slightly different

17 analysis. And I think the guidelines would then provide

18 yet an additional --

19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Yang --

20 MR. YANG: -- reason that we're correct.

21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I mean, the lack of

22 beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so

23 many levels; all right? What differentiates a normal

24 theft from a robbery is the use of force. And the

25 guidelines, in defining the guidelines range for a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
41 1 theft, starts at a much, much lower base level. Starts 2 at a seven, okay? For a robbery, it starts at a base 3 level of 20. 4 Once you start with that huge difference 5 between the use of force and the nonuse of force, 6 obviously, the robbery guideline is always going to 7 include the use of force. The fact that it might be 8 with a gun as opposed to a knife as opposed to a threat 9 of violence or whatever else you want to define it, the 10 use of force is inherent already in the guideline 11 calculation because, otherwise, that -- there's no 12 reason. They could have just had one table and said, if 13 you rob someone, if it was a pure calculation, as you 14 suggest it, without thinking about the gun, it would 15 have been $20,000 is taken, we're all going to start at 16 a offense level of five years and build up from there. 17 That's not what the guidelines do. 18 So when you're taking discretion away from a 19 judge, I think that's one of the reasons we often 20 require specificity, because the guidelines are 21 artificial in so many different ways. And there are 22 gyrations that we go through as judges to comply with 23 dictates that are not very often very clear. 24 MR. YANG: Well, I think -- I'm not here to 25 criticize the guidelines. I think the guidelines have
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 worked for quite some time and have brought some

42

2 rationality to sentencing that didn't previously exist,

3 which was an important thing. The guidelines post

4 Booker, of course, advisory -- are advisory.

5 JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's what I'm

6 trying -- I'm not criticizing, not criticizing. I'm

7 trying to figure out what's the right system, putting

8 this case aside.

9 MR. YANG: Well, we --

10 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if we had the

11 guidelines there -- try this. If the guidelines were

12 here, it wouldn't be such a problem, because they would

13 have -- the commission could look into this and it could

14 take the factor into account. And then we'd have

15 3553(b) and we'd follow that in the future unless it's

16 irrational.

17 But they're out the window. Okay. They're

18 out the window because it was a variance. So now we're

19 left with 924(c), you know, the statute, and we're also

20 left with the provision that says that a -- a court of

21 appeals has to look at a departure or a variance and see

22 if it's reasonable. Is that the right word? Reasonable

23 or rational or something. What's the word?

24 MR. YANG: Well, I think --

25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- on the appellate part.

Alderson Reporting Company

43 1 MR.

Is it reasonable or -- you know, I'll 6 look it up. 7 MR. YANG: I think it is reasonable. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, I think it is too. 9 Okay. So now -10 MR. YANG: Reasonable always is a good word. 11 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct, correct, correct. 12 (Laughter.) 13 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's the -- that's 14 the -- the question in this case beyond the case is 15 really, how do we do that? And so -- so what I would 16 try out is, it would be obvious if you're right and the 17 statute is clear; okay? The -- the 924(c). Then you 18 win. That's the end of it. That's what you think. I 19 don't think it's clear. 20 If it's not clear, what do we do? 21 MR.

5 commission gets any deference with respect to construing

6 Federal statutes.

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I --

8 MR. YANG: With respect to the guidelines,

9 yes, but with respect to construing Federal statutes,

10 I -- I don't think so. And so what we're back to is

11 924(c) and its interaction to the various provisions of

12 the Sentencing Reform Act.

13 The -- the key provisions, they rely on

14 3553(a) and they say look, you have to consider all

15 these factors, but 3553(a) applies in very specific

16 places of the Sentencing Reform Act, including when

17 there are multiple terms of imprisonment and a court has

18 to decide what the total imprisonment is going to be.

19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Counsel --

20 MR. YANG: That's 3584, and that's been

21 taken away because Congress took away the power to -- to

22 have concurrent sentences.

23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you think the

24 case is resolved at a higher level, it seems to me that

25 your -- your friend has a very good technical argument

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
45 1 that says these sentences have to run concurrently. One 2 day, they run concurrently, end of case. 3 And your argument is, you know, you look at 4 the drafting history, the commentary to 2K2.4, all the 5 other arguments you got and you make -- make -- and the 6 basic one is well, that's technically correct, but it's 7 obviously not what Congress had in mind. Congress 8 obviously had in mind adding the mandatory onto a normal 9 sentence, one way or another, under -- under the 10 guidelines in 30 and all the provisions we've been 11 talking about. 12 So if you view the case that way, 13 technically correct, you know, contrary to the obvious 14 policy, what -- what case can you give me that tells us 15 how to approach a conflict like that? 16 MR. YANG: Well, our -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your -18 what's your best case when you have a very significant 19 sanction in the balance, and you have technical 20 compliance on one hand, but clearly contrary to purpose? 21 MR. YANG: We don't think that the -- that 22 they're technically correct. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand 24 that. 25 MR. YANG: We -- we think that there is a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
46 1 plausible argument that they make on the text, but we 2 think that the proper approach is you always have to 3 approach statutes holistically. You look at the 4 statutory text; you look at the Congress's text 5 structure, the context -6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then there 7 are also these basic rules they -- I mean, you insist 8 when citizens deal with the government that they turn 9 square corners, and I think it's right for a criminal 10 defendant when they're facing 30 additional years to 11 insist that the government turn square corners. 12 MR. YANG: Well, I think what you might be 13 referring to is the principle of lenity. But the Court 14 has repeatedly emphasized -- I think Abramski; one of 15 Justice Kagan's recent opinions explains this -- that 16 lenity applies only if there's a grievous ambiguity that 17 you might -- at the end of the day you -18 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I don't think you have 19 to go to a principle of lenity for Mr. Stoler to be 20 right. I mean, you were just saying this is very much 21 along the lines of what the Chief Justice was saying. 22 You would just say something like, look, if we're going 23 to be strictly textualist here, this does not have the 24 kind of requirement you wish it had, which is to say it 25 doesn't have the language that's in 1028A. Your
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
47 1 essential argument is that, read Mr. Stoler's way, this 2 would utterly eviscerate (c)(1)(D)(ii), the consecutive 3 requirement. And I'm quite sympathetic to that. But 4 there's still this question of when a statute doesn't 5 say what you would like it to say and you're reduced to 6 saying if you read it the other guy's way, it would 7 eviscerate what we -- what we meant when we passed 8 another provision, you know, what -- what should we do 9 and where do you point us? 10 MR. YANG: I would say that it's true that 11 it -- it eviscerates the purpose and the whole structure 12 of the statute, but the statute says a lot by removing 13 authority. So the question is what authority was 14 removed. I -- I think it's helpful to look at page 11A 15 of the government's appendix, 3584. 3584(b) governs the 16 discretionary decision of a judge when there are 17 multiple terms of imprisonment, how do you decide the 18 total length. The total length is set by making them 19 concurrent or consecutive, and 3554(b) -- or 3584(b), 20 sorry, specifically says that in deciding the total 21 length by making consecutive or concurrent, you apply 22 the factors set forth in 3553(a). That's what they rely 23 on. 24 But 924(c) removes that authority. 924(c) 25 removes the authority to be able to set the total length

1 of imprisonment when there are multiple terms of

48

2 imprisonment.

3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're saying that in

4 this case, the judge says I can't look at 3553(a)?

5 MR. YANG: No, he does. The -- the judge --

6 there are various other places, but for the total --

7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- but other

8 than for the initial downward departure.

9 MR. YANG: But -- but -- but for the total.

10 You -- for -- you can look at 3553(a) in setting the

11 individual terms, but Congress separately addressed how

12 you make those terms, how you add them, make them -- the

13 total, it depends on the aggregate; right? You --

14 whether you add them or run them concurrently or with

15 each other. So that is what 3554(b) -- or 3584(b)

16 addresses, and that's where the 3553(a) factors are

17 applied, but Congress took that authority away.

18 That's -- that's what I think speaks

19 volumes. And -- and when you look at the structure of

20 the Sentencing Reform Act, the -- the Sentencing Reform

21 Act kind of has a modified real offense sentencing

22 approach. You take a look at the -- the offender, the

23 characteristics of the offender, the history. Not only

24 the offense conduct, you look beyond this particular

25 offense, conduct broadly, what's all the relevant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 conduct, critic conduct --

49

2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're -- you're asking

3 the judge to say, in calculating the sentence for the

4 underlying offense, I'm going to look at all these

5 factors. Frankly, it's meaningless, because what I'm

6 going to do in the 924(c), but I'll do something

7 meaningless.

8 MR. YANG: No, no, no, not at all. If --

9 if, for instance, a judge would say, as in this case, an

10 appropriate sentence is 40 months, right? The judge

11 says an appropriate sentence for this -- each of these

12 four has a 40-month term. In a normal world, if there

13 was also a five-year sentence, the judge would then go

14 to 3584(b) and say I'm going to consider the 3553

15 factors to decide if I'm going to add the 40 to the five

16 years, or I'm going to just run them concurrently so

17 it's five years total. That's what normally happens.

18 Section 924(c) says you can't do that. You

19 have to add it. It is add -- in addition to the

20 punishment, the punishment for the predicate offense.

21 And so we think that simply underscores what -- what has

22 always been the -- the thrust, the understanding of --

23 of 924(c).

24 It is a harsh provision. There is no doubt.

25 But Congress intended that to be harsh because of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
50 1 extreme danger presented when you add a gun to either a 2 crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense. And 3 Congress made that determination that it's going to be 4 at least five additional years for the gun, and if 5 there's a second or subsequent, 25 years. Disagreement 6 with that length of an imprisonment simply circumvents 7 what Congress was doing in 924(c). 8 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if you -- if you're 9 in the realm of what's reasonable and the judge is 10 looking at, well, you are under the appellate provision 11 because he's varied from the guidelines, of course, you 12 have to give the mandatory minimum, there it is, the 13 gun, 25 years. And now the judge thinks, you know, this 14 is way beyond what this guy did. It's fine for the gun, 15 but his total conduct here was -- doesn't warrant such a 16 long sentence. 17 MR. YANG: On appellate -18 JUSTICE BREYER: It's in -- it's in the 19 other part, it's a reasonable thing given this 20 individual who may suffer certain individual things, da, 21 da, da. 22 MR. YANG: Congress -23 JUSTICE BREYER: A reasonable thing to give 24 him one day. 25 MR. YANG: Congress made the determination.

1 You don't do a reasonable --

51

2 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, yeah.

3 MR. YANG: -- analysis.

4 JUSTICE BREYER: If think that, then you

5 win; that's the end of it.

6 MR. YANG: And -- and that's why, you know,

7 when you have a predicate offense that Congress said add

8 this additional mandatory on, you don't look to the

9 length of the total, because maybe -- maybe 30 years, in

10 the judge's view, is not reasonable, but Congress

11 required that.

12 That is a separate -- that is for Congress

13 to decide what the minimum is going to be for the

14 924(c). What would be reasonable is when you take a

15 look at the predicate offense and you say would this be

16 a reasonable -- one day for four felonies, would that be

17 reasonable? And the answer to that is of course not,

18 as -- as my brother conceded at -- in his argument.

19 So, again, I think the whole -- the idea

20 that a judge would go down to one day because of a

21 disagreement with the length of the mandatory minimum

22 simply circumvents the statute and is inconsistent with

23 924(c)'s text.

24 Thank you.

2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER

3 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4 MR. STOLER: There's no affirmative ban in

5 district courts considering 924(c) sentencing when

6 considering the predicate offenses, and given the

7 overarching theme of -- of discretion and parsimony

8 pervades.

9 The -- the -- counsel for the government

10 seems to indicate that we look at 3584(b), we agree that

11 it limits -- that there has to be that 30-year

12 consecutive sentence, but it just guides the court's

13 discretion with respect to the 3553(a) factors. It

14 doesn't say that they only apply to each count, not the

15 aggregate sentence. And you look at 3584 and you read

16 the third provision, it talks about the aggregate

17 sentence in itself.

18 So the -- the reliance by the government on

19 3584 is -- we -- we say is misplaced and does not affect

20 whether or not the -- the total sentencing scheme that

21 the parsimony requirements put on ends the result of the

22 court determining what sentence is sufficient, but not

23 greater than necessary.

24 We don't quarrel that 30 years must be

25 imposed under the mandatory minimums. What we do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review
53 1 quarrel with is whether or not the court should be able 2 to take that -- those factors into consideration, as 3 well as all those other factors that are set forth in 4 3553(a), 3551, 3661, which gives us the -- the 5 determination to be made as to what the -- what should 6 be the appropriate sentence in this case. 7 If there's no other questions. 8 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I was thinking of at 9 a deep level of what Thomas Reed Powell said about the 10 law. He wants us to think of this second part, you 11 know, as related, but really no. Look at the second 12 part, keep it totally separate, and the statute means 13 that the part about robbery has to be done separately. 14 Reed Powell said if the -- you can think of a thing that 15 is inextricably related to another thing without 16 thinking of the thing to which it is inextricably 17 related, you then have the legal mind. 18 (Laughter.) 19 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what he wants us to 20 do. He says that's what the statute requires. 21 MR. STOLER: We submit that the statute 22 shouldn't be read that way in this instance, Your Honor. 23 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it matters that 24 it's a 30-year mandatory minimum? What if it was a 25 one-year mandatory minimum. Would the result be
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 different?

54

2 MR. STOLER: It may. I mean, that's the

3 court's --

4 JUSTICE ALITO: It would? Really?

5 MR. STOLER: Well, it -- it may be different

6 from the standpoint -- no. The one-year has to be

7 imposed.

8 JUSTICE ALITO: A year and a day would be

9 okay?

10 MR. STOLER: If, under the -- the total test

11 of reasonableness and applying the factors the court's

12 supposed to apply, makes that decision that he thinks

13 that -- that that -- he or she thinks that's the

14 appropriate sentence, that -- that may be right, but

15 it's going to be subject to the test of substantive

16 reasonableness on appeal. And the -- here in the

17 instance, it's -- it's a different scenario because it's

18 30 years, Your Honor, and that's what we're saying.

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

20 The case is submitted.
