And the Red Cross is weaker for you than here, and it  comes out the other way. And so what I see going for  you is one page of legislative history which says,  explicitly, you\\'re right.</p><p> He was fired.</p><p> Are those words,  \"competent\" -- you know, in any \"court of competent  jurisdiction\" -</p><p> Yeah, \"State or Federal.\"  You know, I\\'ve got that point. I just want to know who  did this.</p><p> But who? Where did he come  from? Who did he work for? Does anybody know?</p><p> Did you look it up? I  mean, is there -- did you try to find out where this  language really came from? I mean, somebody wrote it.\\n \\n47  It didn\\'t just have computers write it. I mean, there  is a human being who wrote it.</p><p> For this reason.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Let me give you that --\\n\\n what do I do? Maybe you could just say you shouldn\\'t\\n\\n look at legislative history. I\\'m not prepared to say\\n\\n that. What -- what should I do?</p><p> Do you want to deny that  legislative history? It helps you, doesn\\'t it?</p><p> Right.</p><p> Well, that\\'s true. But  these cases that you\\'re talking about are not directly  in point. D\\'Oench, Duhme is the leading case on this  issue, and it used the word \"competent jurisdiction.\"  And John Marshall, you know, who is not, say, Justice X,  did say that the language, absolutely clear, this\\n \\n  means -- because it refers probably to specific courts  and isn\\'t just a general statement of courts in  general -- this means that they\\'re giving jurisdiction.  It\\'s just not just authority to sue and be sued.</p><p> I got that one.</p><p> D\\'Oench, Duhme, my God, is  the -- that\\'s identical to the Bankers\\' one. Identical.  And they come out the other way, and all that\\'s there is  the word \"State and Federal\" -</p><p> Go ahead. Finish.</p><p> This is what\\'s really\\n\\n bothering me here, and I don\\'t know if you can help or\\n\\n not. After reading through the cases pretty quickly, I\\n\\n would think you\\'re right, if I were doing this afresh,\\n\\n and particularly when you have that page of legislative\\n\\n history. I mean, somebody wrote that colloquy and gave\\n\\n it to the senators, and they thought, we don\\'t want\\n\\n Fannie to have the right to go into Federal court all\\n\\n the time. We just want them to have the right when they\\n\\n otherwise would be in Federal court.\\n\\n But when I finished reading the cases, going\\n\\n back to Marshall in 1816, I say, oh, you know, there is\\n\\n something of a rule here. It may not make too much\\n\\n sense, but it\\'s even there in D\\'Oench, Duhme, and --\\n\\n because it\\'s -- actually, I do think it is more even\\n\\n \\n  stronger for the other side than -- than this one. And  then I get Red Cross and the only thing I can do there  is add some old report that sort of seemed to support  the result, which is certainly weaker than your page of  legislative history here.  But I see now it\\'s jurisdiction. And we  shouldn\\'t get things too mixed up. They are hard  enough. And then that seems to say if you say State and  Federal, you -- you see where I\\'m going?</p><p> It\\'s tough. I mean, I find  this pretty tough. I think that there are five major  cases: Three are against you; two are for you. Deveaux  is for you. Osborn uses the word \"incompetent  jurisdiction\"; it\\'s against you. Not surprising, the  Bankers\\' one comes up the same way as Deveaux, but the  D\\'Oench, Duhme is weaker for you than here.</p><p> So I don\\'t know whether to  look into it deeply in this particular case where you\\'re  going to end up with a result that seems to be different  than the other cases, or to say, well, forget it. It  was all decided. Keep to the precedent. Forget the  page of legislative history. It will be better for the  lawyers. And it will be better for the judges. It will  be simpler for them.</p><p> I mean, the one that used  the word \"competent jurisdiction,\" \"having competent  jurisdiction,\" was Osborn.</p><p> What do you do about that?</p><p> I mean, I guess language  that hurts you is \"any court of law, equity, State, or  Federal.\" I mean, that\\'s the D\\'Oench, Duhme one, and  they say that puts you in Federal court. And you -- you  want to say, we found eight statutes, and they say  \"competent jurisdiction,\" and we\\'d love them to be in  State court; we want them to be in State court.  Have you found any that say just something  like \"in any court of law, in equity, State, or\\n \\n Federal,\" and you want them to be in Federal court?</p><p> But what we have to say is,\\n\\n once you added these words \"in any competent\\n\\n jurisdiction,\" what they did, those words took the case\\n\\n out of Federal court unless it\\'s some other basis for\\n\\n getting there and require you to go to State court, and\\n\\n to subtract words -- God, it\\'s -- I mean, as a matter of\\n\\n the English language, it just seems a little tough.</p><p> It is.</p><p> I see. I see.</p><p> I just want you to -- to\\n\\n talk at some point -- I mean, there is a page of\\n\\n legislative history, which could not be more clear. It\\n\\n says exactly what the government says. It says -- they\\n\\n are -- they are asked, does it -- if we did this, aren\\'t\\n\\n we giving these corporations -- I mean, Fannie -- the\\n\\n right to go into a Federal court, although the matter\\n\\n may be purely a State matter? That\\'s not what we\\n\\n intended. All we intended -- then they say, well, you\\n\\n know, they have to look to see whether it\\'s really a\\n\\n State case or whether it\\'s really a Federal case.\\n\\n I mean -- and the words \"competent\\n\\n jurisdiction\" do -- she says do that. That is their\\n\\n natural meaning. I hadn\\'t quite taken that in, but --\\n\\n but it is -- it is their natural meaning that, what\\'s\\n\\n the point of having these here if the statute without\\n\\n them would grant jurisdiction to go into Federal court\\n\\n if you want?</p><p> And that\\'s the dilemma that  I\\'m in.  Anything anybody wants to say to help me  would be welcome.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>But Red Cross didn\\'t have  the competence language. It was just any court, State  or Federal.\\n \\n44</p><p> It shouldn\\'t matter to  the Federal court. They can be there if there is  diversity or if the claim arises under Federal law.</p><p> -- haven\\'t brought it up  to final judgment and you\\'re trying to use it  collaterally.</p><p> You can bring up  subject-matter jurisdiction straight up the ladder, but  you can\\'t when you -</p><p> What did you do -- what\\n\\n does Justice Souter\\'s statement in Red Cross do to your\\n\\n argument? I\\'m talking about the statement on page 257\\n\\n of Red Cross, \"In expressly authorizing suit in Federal\\n\\n court, a provision extends beyond a grant of corporate\\n\\n capacity to sue and suffices to confer a Federal\\n\\n jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n That seems to say if you authorize suit in\\n\\n Federal court, then that\\'s it. Specifically mentioning\\n\\n \\n  Federal court suffices to confer Federal jurisdiction.</p><p> I forgot the name of the  ancient case that -- that said even subject matter, as  wholly as it is, when you\\'ve gone -- when you have a  final judgment you\\'ve got -- done everything on direct  review, then you can\\'t collaterally review.</p><p> Why is competent\\n \\n  jurisdiction -- you -- you have a court. Does it have  competent jurisdiction? Is there basis for  subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction?  That\\'s what competent jurisdiction means.</p><p> Well, the court said  \"general jurisdiction,\" right?</p><p> \"General jurisdiction,\"  instead of saying \"of competent jurisdiction\" when  \"competent\" generally means -- is this -- the -- the  sue-and-be-sued clause gives the corporation capacity to  sue and be sued, but competent jurisdiction is addressed  to the Court.  Does this Court have authority to proceed in  this category of cases?</p><p> But there is a specific\\n\\n statute that makes that crystal clear. And if we -- if\\n\\n Congress wanted Fannie Mae, which it was going private,\\n\\n to be treated the same way as Freddie Mac, then why\\n\\n didn\\'t it say the same thing for Fannie Mae as it\\n\\n said --</p><p> Well, your -- your\\n\\n position then is competent jurisdiction -- as long as\\n\\n you have the word \"Federal\" -- \"State\" or \"Federal,\"\\n\\n you\\'re home free. So it doesn\\'t -- the words \"of\\n\\n competent jurisdiction\" doesn\\'t mean anything. They\\n\\n don\\'t -- it\\'s the use of the word \"Federal\" that gets\\n\\n you into Federal court. And \"of competent\\n\\n jurisdiction,\" they just tagged along those words, and\\n\\n they don\\'t mean anything.</p><p> But there\\'s so many ways  that you could -- if you want to make sure that this  entity gets into Federal court all the time, what  Congress did with Freddie Mac is said, Freddie Mac will  be deemed to be a Federal agency for jurisdictional and  removal purposes.  Now, that is very clear. It means it can\\n \\n40  come into Federal court to sue. It means it can remove  if it\\'s sued in State court.  This, compared to \"court of competent  jurisdiction\" -- which, as I go back to competent  jurisdiction, competence refers to the ability of the  Court, which consists of two things: subject matter and  personal.</p><p> That\\'s because this\\n\\n Court\\'s competence is general competence, which is\\n\\n subject matter, and it\\'s specific competence, which is\\n\\n personal.</p><p> Does that include - you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is  this court competent to hear this controversy\" would  include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you  limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>Well, suppose it means  personal jurisdiction. Why doesn't it parse?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Don't tell us we're not\\n\\n working hard enough.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> They were easier cases.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': '<p>Isn\\'t that USG\\'s\\n\\n position in Portsmouth?</p><p> How could you have  res judicata if you never had subject-matter  jurisdiction?</p><p> If we read things the  way you want us to read them.</p><p> What happens to all the  judgments that have been entered, reading this the way  the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split  jurisdiction with district courts going other ways?  What happens to those old judgments where there wasn\\'t  Federal subject-matter jurisdiction?</p><p> Have all of them read\\n\\n the statute in the same way you have?</p><p> So those are five\\n\\n statutes that don\\'t -- is not -- are -- don\\'t involve\\n\\n Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the\\n\\n two --</p><p> So a Federal question\\n\\n would be --</p><p> But tell me what you  mean.</p><p> We are off by one.</p><p> I\\'ve done -- or had - my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been  able to identify, eight other statutes that use the  \"incompetent jurisdiction\" language.  Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number  of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B,  are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes  may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie  Mae is?</p><p> But why didn\\'t they do\\n\\n the same thing in Ginnie Mae?</p><p> So why didn\\'t they do  that for Fannie Mae?</p><p> We now have three  versions, but that\\'s okay.  (Laughter.)</p><p> They chose very\\n\\n different language, so doesn\\'t that show a conscious\\n\\n act.</p><p> Well, that\\'s arguably to  keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else.</p><p> Well, there, I\\'m\\n\\n presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in\\n\\n context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as\\n\\n personal jurisdiction.</p><p> Now, is there a\\n\\n difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision\\n\\n from a provision creating a cause of action? Let\\'s do\\n\\n the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\\n\\n authorizes suit in any Federal district court of\\n\\n competent jurisdiction.\\n\\n How do you deal with the fact that the ADA\\n\\n generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal\\n\\n courts?</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.

It seems\\n\\n to me it's once the law applies, then you apply normal\\n\\n principles of statutory interpretation.

Mr. Tripp.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACHARY D. TRIPP  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS</p><p> It seems to me that  the significance of the component would be the most  important consideration. If -</p><p> If it's the -- if  it's whatever you think is not quite enough, 70 percent,  but 70 percent of the components -- I mean, that's  really the core of what makes it work. I don't know why  you wouldn't look at that differently than if it's 70  percent, but the 70 percent are, you know, fairly  insignificant.</p><p> I think once you --\\n\\n once you're into your fairly complicated test, I mean, I\\n\\n think it's -- you're off to the races. I mean, what\\n\\n factors do you look at, all of that, when it -- it seems\\n\\n to me the -- the clear argument is whether you want to\\n\\n call it the plain text or not, but it's just focusing on\\n\\n a numerical. It's -- it's -- it's a substantial portion\\n\\n of the components, and now you're saying, well, it kind\\n\\n of depends on what components we are talking about. You\\n\\n know, how much time it takes to make them. Effort, I\\n\\n don't quite understand what effort means in that area.\\n\\n In -- in other words, you're -- you're --\\n\\n you're compromising the principle in a way that really\\n\\n undermines the force of the principle.</p><p> I think that's your\\n\\n answer in this invention, but every other invention is\\n\\n going to have a different mix of the time, the effort,\\n\\n the, you know, qualitative aspect, and it -- again, it\\n\\n does seem to be that once you get beyond looking at\\n\\n purely quantitatively in terms of the components, I\\n\\n don't think you've made much progress in clearing up\\n\\n the -- the litigation costs and the confusion.\\n\\n And I'm also not sure how it fits in with\\n\\n the presumption against extraterritoriality, or at least\\n\\n the clear application of that.</p><p> Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n Mr. Waxman.\\n\\n ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</p><p> You're -- but  you're -- you're beginning with a dialogue at a Senate  hearing on the bill that's pretty weak even in the  legislative history hierarchy, but I don't think you've  mentioned the actual language of the statute yet.</p><p> Time -- time, money,  and effort, but not significance of the component?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>Well, in order to do that,  it would be necessary to know what \"a substantial  portion of the components\" means.\\n \\n46  So what would you tell a jury that means?</p><p> What about the -- what about  the text of the -- of the statute? It doesn\\'t say \"a  substantial portion of the patented invention.\" It says  \"a substantial portion of the components\" of -- of the  patented invention.  So if I were to -- you know, if I were to  ask, what is a substantial portion of the pages of your  brief, I think someone would think that\\'s a quantitative  determination and -- and would not think that, well, you  know, I think pages  to  of your brief are  particularly important, so that would be a substantial  portion of the -- of the pages of your brief.</p><p> Right.</p><p> Do you think it\\'s clear that  the -- that the -- the qualitative interpretation has a  greater extraterritorial effect than the quantitative  interpretation?  What if you have a situation where -- let\\'s  say there are ten components, and nine of them are - are made overseas, but those are very routine things;  those are like the product that was made in the United  States here. You can buy them off the shelf.  But there\\'s one that\\'s very unique. Now,  it\\'s not made specifically for this device, but it\\'s  very -- it\\'s -- it\\'s very unique, and that\\'s -- and  that\\'s made in the United States.</p><p> Do you think -</p><p> -- four would be enough?</p><p> And -- and they would have\\n\\n to be -- all -- all five would have to be made in the\\n\\n United States? Or --</p><p> So here, there were five\\n\\n components?</p><p> Does \"substantial portion\"\\n\\n mean a majority?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>So they are worried about\\n\\n it, in other words.</p><p> That\\'s U.S. conduct, but\\n\\n you read the brief of the German companies, and they\\n\\n said it\\'s a fairly common thing. We\\'ve been making\\n\\n product X forever, and now we invest in an American\\n\\n company, and lo and behold, we just want to import some\\n\\n wood. You know, just some wood, and -- and -- and we\\n\\n can\\'t do it, because we\\'ll be had up under this, because\\n\\n wood is an important -- some kind of -- is -- 30 percent\\n\\n of some kind of a patented thing that we\\'ve been making\\n\\n for years.</p><p> Yeah. Yeah.</p><p> So then the question  becomes one of what limits Congress wanted to put in an  area where it isn\\'t illegal. Now, go ahead with your  argument, because what they\\'re saying -</p><p> Exactly.</p><p> Your real argument is just\\n\\n that -- isn\\'t it -- that you interpret it differently\\n\\n than you do, and we cause a lot of problems in other\\n\\n countries.\\n\\n I mean, they -- they can\\'t tell whether,\\n\\n when they get one component, their lawyer is going to\\n\\n have to know not only British law, it\\'s going to have to\\n\\n know American law.</p><p> And -- and that\\'s a very\\n\\n practical argument.</p><p> And it -- really, we don\\'t  need -- well, you, it\\'s up to you what you want to use.  But I don\\'t -- you -- the problem is, if that\\'s the  point, why do you need this sort of grand thing about - about a -- a presumption against extraterritoriality?</p><p> It\\'s up to you what you  want to use, but -</p><p> Well, I -</p><p> But why do we have to go  into the details here? I mean, it did strike me as an  instance where maybe the less said by us the better. I  mean, would you be happy if we say it means what it  says?  \"All or substantially all\" means a whole  lot. Or what you said, tantamount to all. So if you  get into that circumstance or you get into the \"to\"  circumstance, which is there is a special ingredient  here that has the special qualities, Mr. Manufacturer,  don\\'t get close to that.</p><p> All these lawyers that will  be there telling them, don\\'t get close to that, and the  thing will work over time. If we set a detailed test  down, then all those lawyers will be trying to figure  out how, in fact, they actually do the thing without  quite infringing the detail test.</p><p> End of the case. It says  one means a lot, we need a whole lot, tantamount to the  whole lot, and good-bye.</p><p> Well, how does it help you?  Because I -- it\\'s very hard for me to believe that  Senator Mathias really wanted to interpret American  patent law so that it runs the world when we\\'ve entered  into a treaty which says British patent law runs  Britain, French France, and so forth.

But  you just answered in response to the question that one  could be both. But if it\\'s both -</p><p> Well, but there\\'s  just a different consequence to whether you terminate a  Fourth Amendment right or a due process right under  Parratt v. Taylor.</p><p> I was confused.

But I mean,  regardless, whatever the Fourth Amendment claim is.</p><p> But favorable  termination has nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment  claim, right? And whether your prosecution is just  favorably terminated or not, the Fourth Amendment claim  and, it seems to me, the accrual begins when your Fourth  Amendment rights are violated with, say, an illegal  search.  Whether you eventually are convicted or  acquitted, really, you have a claim for an illegal  search if there\\'s been an illegal search without regard  to favorable termination.</p><p> Well, but you need\\n \\n  to get past the statute of limitations problem and to do  that, you need to characterize it, as I understand it,  as a malicious prosecution claim.

And\\n\\n the -- the defendant wouldn't have qualified immunity,\\n\\n but it's not corrupt. There's nothing malicious about\\n\\n it. Would there be a claim?</p><p> You want us to say there's\\n\\n some kind of a Fourth Amendment claim, but we -- we're\\n\\n not -- we don't know what it is, but there's some kind\\n\\n of a claim. Now, you go back and tell us what kind of a\\n\\n claim it is?</p><p> Don't we have to know what\\n\\n kind of a claim it is to -- before we can say whether it\\n\\n exists?</p><p> But don't we have to know - I'm sorry.</p><p> Yeah, and that's what I'm\\n\\n saying. So you think that there should be a remedy for\\n\\n violations by State and local police officers, but not\\n\\n \\n under identical circumstances, possibly, if it's a\\n\\n\\n\\n Federal officer.</p><p> Well, then what were you\\n\\n saying in your brief? I don't understand it.</p><p> Well, if the outcome of  the -- of the trial is irrelevant to the Fourth  Amendment claim, as it would seem to be in the case of  an unlawful detention, then why should the claim not - why should the accrual of the claim be tied to the  termination of the prosecution?</p><p> Then when would the claim  accrue?</p><p> It's not the conviction. It  would not be defeated by -</p><p> I'll say it attacks -- it  attacks the unlawful detention.</p><p> What happens in this  situation?

Now, does that person have the  kind of claim that you are asserting? And if so, when  would -- when would the claim accrue? Would the  favorable termination defeat the claim?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>That's right. I mean, I\\n\\n may be missing something, although this is quite a\\n\\n simple case. A policeman makes an unreasonable stop and\\n\\n an unreasonable search, thereby violating the Fourth\\n\\n Amendment. Now, you can sue him, assuming you overcome\\n\\n other hurdles.\\n\\n Now he takes you off and puts you in prison,\\n\\n either with a magistrate or without a magistrate, and\\n\\n you are therefore being unreasonably detained. It's an\\n\\n unreasonable search/seizure pursuant to the Fourth\\n\\n \\n Amendment; therefore, it's a violation.\\n\\n\\n\\n Then you have a trial, and using the same\\n\\n rotten evidence, you are convicted. There you don't,\\n\\n though you could. But the reason that you don't is\\n\\n because you are viewed as, by the law so far, being in\\n\\n jail now as a result of your conviction. And the\\n\\n reason, I guess, is practical. We don't want to look\\n\\n into all those convictions and their different\\n\\n standards. Now, that's the -- the framework in my mind.\\n\\n Is it right?</p><p> I didn't think that was a\\n\\n difficult question. I thought that everyone agrees that\\n\\n if a policeman wrongly arrests you -- you know,\\n\\n maliciously arrests you, et cetera -- and there you are\\n\\n in his custody and he brings you over to the jail, puts\\n\\n you in jail, up until the point you see the magistrate,\\n\\n \\n you have a claim for false arrest.\\n\\n32</p><p> And we said that that claim\\n\\n for false arrest is a constitutional claim.</p><p> It violates the Fourth\\n\\n Amendment. What time limit applies? The false arrest\\n\\n time limit, because that's the most analogous.</p><p> So you will accept -- or  will you accept for purposes of this argument that once  this individual is brought by the policeman to jail and  they go before a magistrate, and the magistrate using  the same bad evidence says, stay here in jail for  several -- for a while -- for a week, anyway, until we  get to trial, that that period is a violation of the  Fourth Amendment, assuming that they were all lying, et  cetera.</p><p> Yes. Then the question is:  Do we use the malicious prosecution as an analogy, not  all the elements? And so now the question, great, this  is fabulous, I get to the narrower question I have, why  isn't it a good analogy?</p><p> Why not?\\n\\n Look, the person is being held because the\\n\\n magistrate listening to the policeman detained him, and\\n\\n the magistrate and everybody was very unreasonable, da,\\n\\n da, da. Okay?\\n\\n Now he's there. Day one. Can you bring a\\n\\n case? Yes. Why not?\\n\\n He's been under -- day two. Yes.\\n\\n And he's been held for 90 days. And I can\\n\\n say the same thing, but I won't, up to each of the 90\\n\\n days. 90th day, he's released. It's now the 91st day.\\n\\n Can he bring it? Yes. But now we only have two years.\\n\\n Why only two years? Because we're looking for an\\n\\n analogous statute of the State to give us a -- a limit,\\n\\n and the analogous one, though not perfectly fitting, is\\n\\n malicious prosecution, and that had two years, and\\n\\n that's why. Two years after the release date is the\\n\\n longest. You had better bring it before then, because\\n\\n that's two years since you were unlawfully held.\\n\\n Now, what's wrong with what I just said?</p><p> What's your -- what's the\\n\\n best one? What's the best analogy?</p><p> What is your opinion? What\\n\\n is the State law that does apply the best analogy?</p><p> False arrest. Okay.\\n\\n So now, what is this -- what is the -- what\\n\\n is the statue of limitations for false arrest?</p><p> Okay. Fine. So he was\\n\\n being detained for up to, let's say, the 90th -- 90th\\n\\n \\n48  day. He's still being detained. So now we'll count the  90th day as the beginning of the two-year running. And  so now we run it for two years, and it's still May 12th  or whatever.</p><p> Why not?</p><p> Then we get into the next\\n\\n stage. Now you're in front of a magistrate, and the\\n\\n magistrate says, stay in jail for two more months. Does\\n\\n that violate the Fourth Amendment? Not malicious\\n\\n prosecution. Does it violate the Fourth Amendment?\\n\\n The reason that we tend to think it does is\\n\\n because all the circuits have said it does; that is,\\n\\n Judge Higginbotham said that in the Fifth Circuit. A\\n\\n lot of the circuits picked that up. I'm not saying\\n\\n every one. But they said that, too, violates the Fourth\\n\\n Amendment. Now we have a problem.\\n\\n What statute of limitations do we use for\\n\\n that one? And there, the circuits seemed to have picked\\n\\n malicious prosecution not because they're going to\\n\\n follow every element, but because it's the State law\\n\\n that provides the closest analogy.\\n\\n \\n33  And that seems to me where we are in this  case. You don't have to go much further than that.  Am I right so far?</p><p> Either he's being  held under -- isn't he being held unlawfully on the 41st  day?  And after all, we're not -- we're not  copying the State law. All we're doing is trying to  find an analogous period of time.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>But it's a different  claim. One claim is for arrest, and the other is for  prolonged detention. Two different claims. That's why  I took issue with you when you said if you hold for this  Petitioner, then people who are falsely arrested but  properly convicted will have no claim. I don't -- I  don't see that. They have a false arrest claim. They  don't have a prolonged detention claim.</p><p> Well, why do you make the\\n\\n cutoff conviction? If it turns out, even on habeas,\\n\\n that the police have lied all along and there was never\\n\\n any basis for holding this person, why doesn't -- why\\n\\n don't you have your Fourth Amendment claim until the\\n\\n point where you're released from this unlawful custody?</p><p> When does the Fourth\\n\\n Amendment claim stop? I -- I think co-counsel said if\\n\\n you're convicted, it stops. In -- in response to my\\n\\n question, suppose none of this comes out until habeas,\\n\\n and then we find out the police have lied from day one.</p><p> I think you can have  discrete claims. One wrong is you never should have\\n \\n36  been arrested, so you have a Fourth Amendment claim for  that. Another wrong is they kept you in detention.  They extended that arrest. So I don't see why you have  one wrong which ends on arrest, but then if you are  continuing to be held based on trumped-up false  information, why isn't that like a continuing tort? And  it continues until it ends.</p><p> Can you explain why, even\\n\\n if we accept your theory that -- that the unlawful\\n\\n detention continues until he's released, why shouldn't\\n\\n the statute of limitations trigger the -- when he is\\n\\n initially arrested? Why -- why should the trigger for\\n\\n the statute of limitations be different just because we\\n\\n label this Fourth Amendment --</p><p> It's the same right.  It's the right you had from the very beginning.</p><p> What you're saying is if  you're falsely arrested, you have a good claim for false  arrest. It doesn't matter that you were properly\\n \\n50  convicted. But if you are not only falsely arrested,  but if your detention continues, then you have a claim  for the continued detention.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Mr. Eisenhammer, why should\\n\\n we even get to these questions? As I understand this\\n\\n case, the Seventh Circuit does something, says something\\n\\n that no other circuit does, which is to say that they\\n\\n say that there\\'s no Fourth Amendment claim under Section\\n\\n 1983 at all, full stop.\\n\\n If we think that that\\'s wrong, oughtn\\'t we\\n\\n to just send everything else back to the Seventh Circuit\\n\\n to decide what they think the Fourth Amendment claim\\n\\n looks like? In other words, what elements it has, what\\n\\n accrual date it has, anything that they think about this\\n\\n Fourth Amendment claim, send it back to them, having\\n\\n told them that they\\'re wrong about whether this Fourth\\n\\n Amendment claim exists. Why isn\\'t that -- I mean, all\\n\\n this other stuff, the Seventh Circuit hasn\\'t told us\\n\\n \\n  what they think about it. Circuits are split on it. It  hasn\\'t really been briefed because the principal  question has been whether there is a Fourth Amendment  claim. Why shouldn\\'t we just send it back to them to  decide?</p><p> You would be in agreement?</p><p> I wasn\\'t sure. I thought  that you were arguing.</p><p> A claim for unconstitutional\\n\\n detention.</p><p> Now, what the statute of\\n\\n limitations is on that claim or what the accrual period\\n\\n is on that claim is something that we don\\'t have to\\n\\n decide in order to say, yes, you have a claim under the\\n\\n Constitution for improper detention.</p><p> Mr. Scodro, I -- I just have  to say I read this differently, so you can tell me why  I\\'m wrong.  But I\\'m -- in the last column of the Seventh  Circuit\\'s opinion, so there are twice where the Seventh  Circuit says what it thinks. The first time it says,  when after the arrest a particular person is not let go  when he should be -- so it\\'s after the initial seizure,  and then the person is not let go, the Fourth Amendment  gives way to the due process clause as a basis for  challenging his detention.  And then in the last paragraph it says,  \"Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention  by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out  of the picture.\"  So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh\\n \\n Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth\\n\\n30\\n\\n Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and\\n\\n after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the\\n\\n picture.\\n\\n And at the very basic level, before you get\\n\\n into these questions of what\\'s the accrual date or\\n\\n anything else, it seems that that\\'s the thing that the\\n\\n Petitioner is saying is wrong, that the Fourth Amendment\\n\\n claim continues after arraignment or after legal\\n\\n process. Now, when it accrues, when it doesn\\'t accrue\\n\\n is a different question, but it\\'s still a Fourth\\n\\n Amendment claim, and -- and -- and that\\'s what the\\n\\n Seventh Circuit rejected.</p><p> Mr. Scodro, can I ask -- I\\n\\n might be misunderstanding this, so you\\'ll tell me if I\\n\\n \\n am. But it seems as though the position that you\\'re\\n\\n41\\n\\n taking now is diametrically opposed to the position that\\n\\n you took in the Seventh Circuit. So I\\'ll just read you\\n\\n something, and this is from oral argument, but my clerk\\n\\n tells me that this is what happened. I think it is not\\n\\n a transcript, but maybe there is. But at least this is\\n\\n what my clerk tells me happened at oral argument.\\n\\n Judge Rovner says there are ten other\\n\\n circuits that have now recognized this kind of claim,\\n\\n this kind of Fourth Amendment claim. And she said,\\n\\n let\\'s just assume that we do what those ten other\\n\\n circuits have done, which, of course, they didn\\'t do,\\n\\n but she says let\\'s just assume it.\\n\\n At what point would you think the statue of\\n\\n limitations would begin to run? And then you -- or\\n\\n maybe not you, but you --\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> You say, well, if you were\\n\\n to recognize such a claim --</p><p> -- the accrual is the time\\n\\n at which the proceedings are terminated in favor of that\\n\\n individual.\\n\\n So in this case it would be -- I think the\\n\\n date would have been May , 2011.\\n\\n \\n42  And then Chief Judge Woods says, so you\\'re  assuming that the constitutional tort would follow the  same pattern that State law does and require the  favorable termination, because if there\\'s no favorable  termination for all the policy reasons the States have  considered, there\\'s no injury.  And again, whoever the lawyer was said,  that\\'s correct.  So am I misunderstanding this, or are you  saying that\\'s not correct; that\\'s wrong?</p><p> Is there no transcript for  this?</p><p> Oh, I don\\'t think that  that\\'s -- I mean, maybe, I guess. I mean, it seems to  me that the much more natural way of understanding this  is to say, look, if we do what every other circuit has  done in the sense that we acknowledge that there is a  Fourth Amendment claim here, post-legal process,  something which you yourself have now acknowledged  today, that if we acknowledge that, what would the  accrual date be? And then the lawyer says the accrual  date would be the date of termination.</p><p> And -- and now you\\'re saying  it wouldn\\'t be. And I actually don\\'t know whether it  should be or it shouldn\\'t be. I don\\'t think the Seventh  Circuit for a moment considered that question. And I\\n \\n44  guess it\\'s -- it\\'s another reason why I think we should  just send the whole thing back. The Seventh Circuit can  figure out whether you forfeited this claim. The  Seventh Circuit can figure out, if you didn\\'t forfeit  this claim, what the right answer is. But to me, this  language -- and I have not listened to the tape myself,  so I have to admit that -- but to me, this language  suggests that you forfeited this.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Okay.

Because from what I understand from the  briefing, malicious prosecution is defined differently  from State to State.  So if that\\'s the case, what are the elements  that you see for a 1983 claim? Does it include malice?</p><p> All right. So let\\'s\\n\\n stop.

The question\\n\\n presented is, does the Fourth Amendment consonance house\\n\\n \\n  a malicious prosecution claim, which is something very  different than what you\\'re describing as a Fourth  Amendment seizure and detention without legal process.</p><p> In a State court  proceeding, the State analogue, what would be the rule  of accrual ending? You get convicted; you don\\'t find  out about the false testimony until habeas, State or  Federal.  When, in that situation, would accrual  occur?</p><p> You know, counselor,  it\\'s not as if most States don\\'t receive that kind of  notice in these situations. The defendants are just not  believed in most, until some independent evidence is  discovered long after the conviction. In my\\n \\n experience -- and you can point to one that\\'s\\n\\n40\\n\\n different -- I\\'ve never come across any of these cases\\n\\n where any defendant falsely accused of a crime hasn\\'t\\n\\n vigorously announced his or her innocence and vigorously\\n\\n tried to tell the authorities this police officer is\\n\\n corrupt.\\n\\n So I\\'m not -- I don\\'t know what extra notice\\n\\n you need other than that. The situation is unique.\\n\\n We\\'re talking about total fabrication. You have so many\\n\\n other ways out of liability, qualified immunity, Franks.\\n\\n There are so many other protections against the State\\n\\n and individual officers for -- for errors.\\n\\n But why should we worry about you not\\n\\n receiving notice?</p><p> Why do you need to give  evidence to somebody who\\'s fabricated the reasons why  you\\'re in jail? And -- and I don\\'t know why you would  think that it\\'s important to cut off recovery against  the police officer who bases an arrest solely on  fabrication. It doesn\\'t seem so horrible to me. Years  later or immediately, if you\\'ve done something as  untoward as that, as unconstitutional as that, why  should it matter?</p><p> Is it a detention - you\\'ve described this in various ways. Is it a  detention without constitutional probable cause? Is it  a detention with -- with no proper legal process? Where  exactly is the Fourth Amendment violation? Because in\\n \\n  false arrest and false imprisonment claims, according to  Wallace, as soon as you get legal process, there\\'s been  an intervening end to the false imprisonment because  someone else has imprisoned you.  So what remains in this case? How do we  define the constitutional violation so -</p><p> So detention without  probable -</p><p> No, but I\\'m -- I -- I --\\n\\n the only way I could think of it was thinking of it in\\n\\n this way, because you\\'re not claiming malicious\\n\\n prosecution or not.</p><p> What happens to the\\n \\n person who\\'s let out on bail? Are they out of luck\\n\\n\\n\\n under your theory?</p><p> Are you defining\\n\\n \"detention\" as broadly as Justice Ginsburg was?</p><p> You\\'re saying it\\'s  improper legal process.</p><p> Without legal process.</p><p> Am I understanding your\\n\\n argument correctly?</p><p> And because you have --\\n\\n there\\'s been no intermediate force, no intermediary\\n\\n stepping in and breaking the chain of causation;\\n\\n correct?</p><p> So it\\'s not a question\\n\\n of whether -- when it starts. The question is: When\\n\\n does the illegal detention finish?</p><p> And so I thought if\\n \\n you\\'ve never received it, then doesn\\'t your time to\\n\\n\\n\\n accrue for the improper detention occur when you\\'re no\\n\\n longer detained? Here, it was the not guilty; correct?</p><p> Was he subject to proper  legal process? If legal process is corrupted because  there isn\\'t -- I always understood legal process as used  in Wallace and earlier of our cases as an independent  intermediary, generally a judge or a grand jury or  someone who looks at the facts as they exist and  independently makes a determination whether probable  cause has happened.  If you have a corrupted legal process where  what the independent adjudicator is looking at is not  true because it\\'s based on false information, have you  received legal process -- proper legal process?</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n Mr. Wirken.\\n\\n ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W.

Is -- is  there that difference?</p><p> Well -- well,\\n\\n that's --</p><p> Maybe this isn't  that, but that -- that's very legalistic in the sense  that you're saying well, you can't divide this, but you  have to pay her money so that's she's put in the same  position as if you'd divided this.

And it's  subsidiary purpose was to do so in a way that preserved  disability payments and didn't allow them to be divided.</p><p> Well, it's - concern for former spouses is certainly evident in the  Act, but as we've always said, no statute pursues its  purpose at all costs, and with obviously a different  purpose applicable with respect to the part of the law  that says you can't divide disability payments. So I  don't think you can resort to the purpose of the statute  in -- in a general sense to -- to resolve every  subsidiary legal issue.</p><p> Well, then I mean, I\\n\\n think it's -- it's not like there was a bait and switch\\n\\n involved.</p><p> But when -- when\\n\\n did -- the disability benefits started how many years\\n\\n after the divorce?</p><p> Well, then maybe I'm\\n\\n the one who insisted on the part of the law that says\\n\\n when it's disability, you don't get to divide that.</p><p> If I were a  legislator and I passed this law for a particular  purpose, and at the end of the day the result is the  same as if the law hadn't had any -- it has no practical  effect at all, I would think that's contrary to -- to  what the legislation was designed to accomplish.</p><p> Well, if I were -</p><p> Well, but again, the\\n\\n law does something else too.

That's the only\\n\\n difference. So in other words, if it says, no, you\\n\\n cannot give the wife more than 50 percent of the\\n\\n \\n40  pension, then what they could do is have the decree, and  it says the wife gets 50 percent, gets -- sorry -- you  can't -- you cannot give them more than 50 percent - I'm getting mixed up in my thing.  It says you can't give more than 50 percent,  and then there's a statute says you can't give -- you  can't give 60 percent, but the judge says, here's what  I'll do: I'll give you 50 percent from this, and I'd  like to give you more than 60 percent so I'm going to  take  percent from something else.</p><p> Is that the only\\n\\n difference?</p><p> So if that says no, then\\n\\n why, if it goes down because of the choice of the\\n\\n husband, who is protected in this choice by the\\n\\n exception, why is that different.</p><p> Right.</p><p> In a state statute that\\n\\n says no.</p><p> I'm saying can the State\\n\\n just say, well, we don't care. There is a state statute\\n\\n which says that we have to keep the wife's share at no\\n\\n more than 50 percent. But let's forget about that.\\n\\n There's a federal statute to that effect. We'll have\\n\\n \\n\\n our State law. Can't do that, can it?\\n\\n39</p><p> I'm not keeping that out of\\n\\n it.</p><p> And then can the State\\n\\n court do something about that?</p><p> I'll tell you what.\\n\\n There's a statute, a federal statute, says if taxes go\\n\\n up, or if the payments are reduced for retirement, under\\n\\n no circumstances can the wife obtain more than the\\n\\n reduced -- half the reduced payment.</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> Suppose the statute, it  said, following Mansell, that the wife cannot have more  than 50 percent of the actual after tax income from\\n \\n\\n retirement. Then can the State do it?\\n\\n38</p><p> It depends on State law.  In other words -- in other words, if you say that 50  percent goes to the wife, 50 percent goes to the  husband, and you cut it, then more than 50 percent will  go to the wife.</p><p> Yeah. Now, second thing\\n \\n37  is, unfortunately, Congress lowers the amount. Does the  half go down to the wife too?</p><p> State court says yes.  Okay.</p><p> Okay. Yes. Yes.</p><p> Explain this. I'll have an  easier time if you can explain it.  What the decree says is 50 percent of the  retirement goes to the husband and 50 percent to the  wife. It doesn't say what the retirement is.  Suppose that -- that ten years later,  government raises the retirement. Does the wife get  more?</p><p> I know.</p><p> That's fine.</p><p> That's true. So it's given\\n\\n to her, but it's subject under Federal law to a\\n\\n contingency. We used to have our first-year property\\n\\n class filled with this kind of stuff. I mean, you know,\\n\\n somebody would get a horse, but he'd only get the horse\\n\\n on the contingency that Uncle Joe died, which doesn't\\n\\n \\n  happen for 30 years. But, nonetheless, say something  that happens to that property subject to the contingency  on day . That's what this sounds like to me.</p><p> No. That's not what it\\n\\n says in the statute. It says in the statute that it is\\n\\n illegal to treat disposable retired pay as property of\\n\\n the member and his spouse. That is what is now legal.\\n\\n That's legal; right? With an exception.\\n\\n The exception is the result of a waiver of\\n\\n retired pay. That, you can't do. So you can't do it on\\n\\n day ; you can't do it day ; you can't do it day 30.\\n\\n And what they are saying is a well-known property\\n\\n interest. It is an interest that you do not get till\\n\\n day 40. But you can't divide it on day . Just like\\n\\n it's a -- like, you know, they're used to be these\\n\\n property interests that you received on a contingency.</p><p> There is a disability. The  disability is that if it turns out that what you are  giving over time is money that was turned in to get the  disability, it is illegal for you to do it. Now, that's  what's there at the time of the decree.</p><p> Yes, there is.</p><p> I'm saying there's a  Federal law here, and the Federal law says: I'm very  sorry, you cannot give this money to the spouse, for  good reason or bad, perhaps bad. But it says you can't.  And is the fact that you gave that money to the spouse  ahead of time, why does that matter? That's his  argument.</p><p> Maybe it's too complicated.</p><p> Suppose it turns out that  in time one, we enter a divorce decree. The divorce  decree says and in addition, you're going to get half of  what Uncle Joe gives Sam, the husband. By that time, it  turns out to be -- I mean, from the beginning, Uncle Joe  leaves property in a form that it's illegal to give to  the woman. I can imagine cases.  I mean, can the State give money that later  on it turns out that it was absolutely illegal to give  that person that money? I don't know how that works. I  would be very surprised if res judicata in divorce cases  says: Okay, I'm sorry, we have a decree here, and then  we're going to violate Federal law because the decree  violates Federal law, as it turns out.</p><p> You're not -- I'm not  arguing for you. In that case I'll ask him. But the  divorce decree changed nothing. It simply gave her what  was hers.</p><p> Is it under the community  property law that the 50 percent that the spouse  received of the retirement pay was hers even if they  hadn't been divorced?  In other words, what is community property?  I thought community property is the two spouses'  interest in the property, each of which owns half from  day one. Is that right?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>What would be\\n\\n noncomplying with Federal law if you reopened the\\n\\n divorce decree and the judge says now you get a share --\\n\\n a larger share of some other property?</p><p> What about them saying we  divided the property based on a certain expectation that  the wife would have so much, and now, because the amount  is lower, then the divorce decree should be reopened so  we can give her more of another asset to make up for  what she's missing.</p><p> An alimony is something\\n\\n \\n\\n that one spouse pays to the other based on economic\\n\\n\\n\\n need. The division of property gives a spouse the\\n\\n property outright. It's hers. It's not something that\\n\\n she is getting from somebody else. It is hers, because\\n\\n there's an enormous difference between equitable\\n\\n division of property and alimony.</p><p> Suppose that what the\\n\\n court had said is, taking a look at what the retirement\\n\\n pay is now, how much it is total, and had specified then\\n\\n a dollar amount for the wife equivalent to what the half\\n\\n was before the disability benefits, that would be okay;\\n\\n and if it takes disability later, she still keeps the\\n\\n amount that was awarded, the dollar amount.</p><p> Well, as I pointed out,\\n\\n those are different animals then that -- the -- the\\n\\n property belongs to her, alimony and child support.\\n\\n And alimony, suppose she remarries. It\\n\\n ends, right?</p><p> What consideration? I  mean, being aware of this possible diminution, the  lawyer for the -- for the spouse will say, I don't want  to get half of the MRP; I want to get a dollar amount  that's equivalent to what half of the MRP is right now.</p><p> How consequential is the  issue before us? Because if you're right, then in all  future divorce settlements, they won't say half of the  Military Retirement Pay. They'll give a dollar amount  which is equal to what the Military Retirement Pay is  before any disability payment kicks in.</p><p> But you said he could pay  her this amount, this indemnification out of the  disability -</p><p> Why not?</p><p> Why isn't your solution,\\n\\n and I think you're saying when he elects the disability,\\n\\n when -- when he does that, then the State court can\\n\\n provide an indemnification for her that's equal to the\\n\\n amount that she's losing. But isn't that just an\\n\\n end-run around the Mansell decision? The Mansell\\n\\n decision says --</p><p> But the point is the  divorce court will know if he's already getting  disability pay, then her share of the pension will be so  much less. And with that knowledge, the divorce court  can say, so I'm going to give her more of some other  property.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>But sorry to come back to  this, Mr. Unikowski, but you are making a distinction,  right, that the court can take into account this rule  when it's setting alimony and child support? It just  can't take into account this rule when distributing  other kinds of property; is that right?</p><p> Right.</p><p> Right. You're making a\\n\\n distinction between need-based payments and property\\n\\n division.</p><p> And -- and this rule can be\\n\\n taken into account in the former, but not in the latter.</p><p> But could a court say, well,  in light of the fact that the woman is not getting the  usual community property division, that that factor  could -- that that could factor into the determination  of alimony or the determination of child support?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Is -- is the answer that\\n\\n there's a difference in adjusting alimony payments\\n\\n and property -- and -- and property settlements that\\n\\n have been concluded?</p><p> Then -- then what -- would  the family court's order here be proper?</p><p> The retirement is the only  asset.</p><p> So suppose the only asset  is the pension.

If it had read\\n\\n \\n\\n Petitioner's entitled to $250 a month, period, full\\n\\n\\n\\n stop, to ensure that that is received by her, she'll get\\n\\n $250 a month from his Military Retirement Pay.</p><p> She can't go back into\\n\\n court -- I thought in divorce courts you can go back and\\n\\n change circumstances and seek a modification of the\\n\\n monetary awards. Why can't she do that?</p><p> So how could he take any  action that impinges on what's her money or her property\\n \\n\\n right?</p><p> More curiosity.</p><p> And -- and you may not\\n \\n32  know this, I don't know if it's in the record. Does he  have a -- a job after he retired?</p><p> Where he gets it from it  doesn't matter?</p><p> Well -</p><p> Sure. But that goes to  the issues of alimony and -- and child support. Those  will get made up there.</p><p> I don't -- I mean, I  don't know the answer legally, but is -- there is a  difference in terms of what Congress might have expected  or not expected.</p><p> No. But what I'm saying  to you, as a matter of policy, is that right?</p><p> The problem is, really,  that when people are getting divorced and they already  know they can't divide up the disability pay, that the  courts have a full picture and can then determine  alimony and child custody with those factors in mind.  And we presume that, at the time of their divorce, this  woman was relying on a certain amount of income that  would be fixed for the rest of her life, and she planned  her life around that income. And he has now taken an  act independent of her and not just reducing her income,  but with her reduction of income, he's also getting a  tax benefit. So he's getting, you know, whatever,   percent, a third more than she is by this unilateral  act.  In terms of policy, that is a substantially  different impact -</p><p> I -- I think that's the\\n\\n U.S.'s position and your adversary's, which is, if, as a\\n\\n result of the original settlement divorce decree, it\\n\\n became her property, what right did he have any -- to\\n\\n take any action that would remove that property or take\\n\\n it away from her?</p><p> -- and one that, you  know, the government is taking the position that if  you're doing this post-divorce, you're changing the  nature of the policy.</p><p> So is -- is -</p><p> So the -- the agreement,  the court's order I know required him to pay a certain  amount. It -- it took care of the Laches question.  What happens moving forward? The military pays her 50  percent minus the disability pay and he has to pay  separately the difference?</p><p> I know you do. The  question is how and why.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Well, how do you deal  with your adversary's position that her borrowing from  our prior case that the only reasonable expectation that  the Court or she could have had was that his military  pay was always subject to a potential deduction for  disability pay? That's basically his argument, that the  act tells anyone relying on military pay that it can, as  a matter of law, be changed by a disability award.</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': '<p>Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n The case is submitted.\\n\\n (Whereupon, at : a.m., the case in the\\n\\n above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> Thank you, counsel.

Before we get started, Ms. Maynard,  Ms. Maynard and Mr. Waxman, the Court has decided to  give each of you five extra minutes, and you can  proceed, Ms. Maynard, when you\\'re ready.</p><p> So this -- no?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Oddly enough, I -- I  would -- I would find an explanation far more convincing  as a layperson, if, in fact, there had been notice and  comment proceedings before an expert agency, which, in  fact, having heard all the different views on what that  word \"notice\" means, and having figured out whether if  we allow day one notice, what\\'s going to happen is we\\'re  going to gut the possibility of people going in and  making these exchanges, because everybody will be free  under the  -- under whatever this is  -- (a), to go\\n \\n  and start bringing declaratory-judgment actions. And  somebody will make that argument, somebody will make the  opposite, and we\\'ll know what we\\'re doing.  So -- so that\\'s the -</p><p> Okay. I\\'ll read the next  paragraph, you can\\'t do that in oral argument. I\\'m just  illustrating to you one of the many things I don\\'t  understand, and why it seems to me this would work out a  lot better if you could somehow get this to a rule  making.</p><p> Provide the what? What is  it you\\'re to provide notice of?</p><p> Yeah, yeah, that\\'s true.</p><p> Then all the declaratory\\n\\n courts come in and everybody jumps in on day . That\\'s\\n\\n you\\'re belief.</p><p> No, he\\'ll give it. He\\'ll\\n\\n give it.</p><p> That\\'s right. Thank you.</p><p> You\\'re right. \"Shall\"\\n\\n means \"shall.\" Okay? But let\\'s stop there because,\\n\\n first, the Federal part, which you just read, doesn\\'t\\n\\n say that\\'s the only remedy or that there are others.\\n\\n But even if it did, we wouldn\\'t know whether California\\n\\n law picked up just the substantive part, or the\\n\\n substantive plus the remedy. And even if we knew that,\\n\\n we wouldn\\'t know whether some other State would be free\\n\\n to pick up in their own State law \"shall,\" but not\\n\\n exclusivity as to remedy. And those involve either\\n\\n preemption questions, or questions of interpretation of\\n\\n State law, and none of that is briefed. And, therefore,\\n\\n we stop. \"Shall\" means \"shall.\" How do you like that?\\n\\n No, you don\\'t, but tell me why not.</p><p> No. I think it does.</p><p> So why haven\\'t you driven\\n\\n \\n\\n us to the following conclusion, which will be\\n\\n48\\n\\n unsatisfactory, again, from everybody\\'s point of view?\\n\\n We said you\\'re right --</p><p> Yeah. But you don\\'t\\n\\n \\n  need -- you don\\'t need explicit regulatory authority.  There are many situations where you defer to an agency\\'s  determination that can have informal -- you know, you  all know all that. So -- so -- so I -- I would stick  with the idea of the FDA doing this first, but maybe I  can\\'t get there. And if I can\\'t get there, I\\'m stuck.</p><p> That isn\\'t the problem.\\n\\n The problem is you take her reading, there\\'s language\\n\\n supporting it, but you can read that word notice, gee,\\n\\n if you read it, tough, you can\\'t work it.</p><p> -- same thing the Chief  just said.</p><p> So -</p><p> The system that was\\n\\n supposed to set up a -- a system, where you\\'ve put\\n\\n tremendous incentives on people to negotiate and to work\\n\\n it out in an orderly way, that you can just gut it by\\n\\n simply filing your commercial notice on day ?</p><p> Yeah, yeah.</p><p> -- no declaratory actions,\\n\\n they\\'re all frozen. Ah, until you give the notice of\\n\\n marketing.</p><p> And now -- now, but that\\'s\\n\\n the language.\\n\\n Now, look at the next one. (B), okay, (A),\\n\\n or whatever that thing is. Hey, once they give the --\\n\\n the , the Section () notice --</p><p> Yes. But there is what you\\n\\n already noticed about. What does this notice say? And\\n\\n what it says is that you have to provide more -- no\\n\\n later than 180 days, is notice of -- maybe -- it doesn\\'t\\n\\n even say this; it\\'s not a complete sentence -- of the\\n\\n first commercial marketing of the biological product\\n\\n licensed.\\n\\n Now, how could you do that if you don\\'t know\\n\\n what the product licensed is?</p><p> And I take it that they had\\n\\n in the agency -- this goes to an agency, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\n And I have -- in the agency, they have the authority to\\n\\n say, we will license this provided it\\'s made this way,\\n\\n but not that way; provided you do this kind of a check,\\n\\n but not that kind of a check. They have a lot of power\\n\\n over what is licensed.\\n\\n So how can you provide notice -- by the way,\\n\\n maybe that isn\\'t what notice means. Maybe it just means\\n\\n notice that you will commercially market X, or maybe it\\n\\n means some combination thereof. The reason that I point\\n\\n to that ambiguity -- which, to me, is a crucial\\n\\n \\n  ambiguity -- and it has to do with both your arguments,  indeed, all of them on both sides. There is an agency  here, isn\\'t there?</p><p> And so all we have to do\\n\\n is, number , day , they give the Section () notice,\\n\\n send them all the information. On day , they give the\\n\\n commercial notice, and all of a sudden everybody is free\\n\\n to give declaratory judgments.</p><p> Yeah, that\\'s right. And\\n\\n that\\'s what it\\'s supposed to be? That\\'s what it\\'s\\n\\n supposed to be?</p><p> Yeah, I\\'ve got it.</p><p> All right. Now, we are  being asked to interpret very technical provisions that  I find somewhat ambiguous and am operating in a field I  know nothing about. But it\\'s going to have huge  implications for the future. So why isn\\'t the way to go  about this case to ask the agency to issue some  regulations? Then when we see their interpretation, you  all will be able to argue that their interpretation  exceeds the statutory delegation. And by doing that, we  would have a better picture.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Can you explain the\\n\\n difference -- there are two rounds of patent\\n\\n infringement; right?

Why can\\'t you argue that the notice is\\n\\n defective and seek a declaratory judgment on that basis,\\n\\n that the notice is insufficient, doesn\\'t provide you\\n\\n with adequate notice as required by statute?</p><p> Exactly.</p><p> That\\'s certainly not  Amgen\\'s position, so -</p><p> Mr. Yang, you -- you\\n\\n indicate that (l)() is the exclusive remedy for a\\n\\n ()(A) violation.</p><p> All right. Well, let me\\n\\n know where I get it wrong, but -- or at least I\\n\\n understand that\\'s the primary position of -- of your\\n\\n side.

By your\\n\\n definition, they could go the biosimilar and the\\n\\n license --</p><p> -- product could go all\\n\\n through round . They\\'ve now narrowed their dispute. I\\n\\n thought round  involved disputes about other patents,\\n\\n not the ones that they narrowed. And so wouldn\\'t your\\n\\n reading always force round  into the post-license\\n\\n -year period? I thought the whole purpose of the\\n\\n statute was to get round  and round  done and done\\n\\n before the -year period was finished.\\n\\n \\n36</p><p> No, no, no. You still  haven\\'t answered my question.</p><p> All right? So if you\\n\\n don\\'t invoke the Federal process, what remains? That\\'s\\n\\n not a remedy. That\\'s a different Federal process, the\\n\\n declaratory-judgment process. That\\'s what (C) says.\\n\\n Under your reading, (B) and (C) become\\n\\n superfluous, because if you can get a State law\\n\\n information-exchange provision under (C) or -- or under\\n\\n State law, why give the remedy of starting a\\n\\n declaratory-judgment action at all?</p><p> You\\'re assuming - you\\'re assuming commercial launch has to be  years  plus .</p><p> I\\'m assuming that  commercial launch should be  plus  -</p><p> -- because you only have  an exclusive license for  years.</p><p> That strengthens my\\n\\n argument.</p><p> Because if the FDA is\\n\\n taking that position, then it\\'s basically kicking off\\n\\n the possibility of round  pretty early.</p><p> That -- that\\'s -- no.  It\\'s not quite that. \"Shall\" is if you want to invoke  this Federal process, this is what you have to do.</p><p> That goes back to\\n\\n preemption.</p><p> But that begs the\\n\\n question on the question we\\'re not looking at, but it\\n\\n begs the question on point  -- on the first point which\\n\\n is, is it a requirement that the biosimilar applicant\\n\\n give over the application. It is certainly a\\n\\n requirement of the statute, the remedy may be file a\\n\\n declaratory-judgment action.</p><p> If it\\'s not preempted,  how would it be mooted?</p><p> I\\'m sorry. If the  biosimilar files a notice of intent to file the  application and a copy of the application, if it  complies with all of the steps in Phase , does it estop  the bio -- the -- the licensed product holder from  seeking a declaratory-judgment action?</p><p> Well, that\\'s assuming  good faith. And that\\'s the next question, which is if  you -- if the biosimilar doesn\\'t comply, you\\'re saying  the other side can sue. But what happens if you do  comply? Can the other side -- and the other side fails  to, they -- they don\\'t give you the notice that they\\'re  required to. They don\\'t do something that\\'s required on  their part in that exchange process.</p><p> What is your biosimilars  remedy in that case?</p><p> All incentives have a  way of failing. Just look at our society.</p><p> So - (Laughter.)</p><p> Could it -- could the  company with the product file a declaratory-judgment  action when they don\\'t know what you\\'re going to do? Do  they have a good-faith basis for believing you\\'re going  to infringe if they don\\'t have the application to look  at until they get discovery?</p><p> Tell me how.</p><p> Can I go back to the  beginning of Justice Breyer\\'s question. He made an  assumption that until the approval of the product, that  the other side won\\'t know exactly what it is that\\'s  going to be approved, particularly in a situation like  this, where you -- you\\'ve kept your application from  them so they don\\'t have it.  Take -- address that issue. In your brief  you say they can get it. They can get it from the  industry, from the SEC filings, from -- from FDA talk,\\n \\n\\n all of that stuff. But that won\\'t tell them exactly\\n\\n\\n\\n what it is that you\\'re intending to market.\\n\\n So -- or the other side -- how -- how would\\n\\n you know? If you start a declaratory-judgment action,\\n\\n as you\\'re entitled to do, wouldn\\'t you know then?\\n\\n Couldn\\'t you get it in discovery?</p><p> -- opinion letters or --\\n\\n or --</p><p> In any litigation, have\\n\\n they taken a different position?</p><p> Has it been a consistent\\n\\n position in other situations? I don\\'t know if it gets\\n\\n --</p><p> So you\\'re asking us,\\n\\n assuming, just an assumption for the sake of argument,\\n\\n that we rule in your favor and say, as you\\'ve asked us\\n\\n to say, that a declaratory judgment is the -- that --\\n\\n the only remedy available, and there is no Federal\\n\\n injunction that\\'s possible here, do we vacate and remand\\n\\n for the court below to decide whether State law\\n\\n provides --</p><p> I\\'m sorry, so I say the  statute says -- we say the statute says that.</p><p> What are we doing?  We\\'re saying the State law is moot?</p><p> Do we have your\\n\\n assurances that this is the FDA\\'s position?</p><p> Mr. Yang, do --</p><p> -- that -- really, the  State law would end up, under your theory, forcing a  biosimilar to invoke Phase I. Because at every stage,\\n \\n52  you -- where they choose to opt out, they -- you will  just run to court and say, my State law remedy is force  them to take the next step. Give me the application,  then identify, then do this. You\\'re going to -- there\\'s  no longer a choice.</p><p> They lost on all the  wider ones.  I -- I\\'m not sure what unfairness there is  to the license.</p><p> I\\'m sorry, Mr. Waxman.  Assume that there has been phase I, round one and round  two before the approval. The district court has decided  one of two things. There is a patent infringement.  It\\'s issued an injunction. The FDA has narrowed the  scope of things substantially.  If the applicant was seeking the world and\\n \\n59  the FDA is the one who narrowed it, why isn\\'t it fair to  the licensed product holder to let that injunction  continue until there\\'s now certainty that there isn\\'t?  If the -- if the patent infringement process ended up  saying no infringement, district court agreed and there  is no injunction, so these licensed products is going to  deal with goods in the market, but they\\'ve gotten a shot  at this, and the claims are now even more narrow.</p><p> If you -- if you go  through the process the way it\\'s anticipated.</p><p> -- through you seeking\\n\\n injunctions to participate unwillingly.</p><p> You\\'re -- you\\'re just --\\n \\n\\n all you\\'re saying to me is that there\\'s built-in\\n\\n53\\n\\n incentives --</p><p> -- for the applicant to\\n\\n invoke and participate in phase .</p><p> What you\\'re not telling\\n\\n me is, it\\'s no longer a choice --</p><p> -- because State law can\\n\\n force them --</p><p> But that -</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.

I guess I don't\\n \\n  understand why this isn't a segregation harm. Here, the  City is saying, you've done this redlining; you've done  this reverse redlining. It's not that it just causes  various foreclosures all over the City; it's causing  foreclosures in particular concentrated areas, and it's  doing that because of racial segregation.  And at the same time, it's preventing that  racial segregation from ever being lifted because those  communities are becoming more and more blighted and less  and less capable of becoming integrated communities. So  everything about this complaint is about racial  segregation, it seems to me.</p><p> Not parens patriae. This is\\n \\n  their own interest in maintaining their communities free  of the kind of racial discrimination that the Act says  causes neighborhood blight.</p><p> Well, but they are a person  aggrieved under the -- given Congress' purposes in the  Act, because they are saying, as you did this redlining,  as you did this reverse redlining, our communities, the  thing that makes us a city was becoming more and more  blighted, and that's what we are trying to recover for,  the -- the costs of responding to that, the -- the costs  of not having revenues in order to carry out our  services for that community and for others.</p><p> So do you think everything I  just said, if their complaint was written like that,  that they could maintain a suit?</p><p> Mr. Katyal --</p><p> Can I ask a separate\\n\\n question? We've been talking a lot about zone of\\n\\n interests and the question about whether the\\n\\n zone-of-interest test applies at all.\\n\\n Because you have three cases prior to this\\n\\n 1988 re-enactment of the old 1968 language. And in each\\n\\n of three cases -- in Trafficante, in Gladstone, in\\n\\n \\n Havens -- the Court very specifically says that this\\n\\n\\n\\n language stretches to the limits of Article III.\\n\\n So Congress is amending the statute in 1988\\n\\n against that backdrop. Why shouldn't we understand that\\n\\n to mean that the language means it stretches to the\\n\\n limits of Article III?</p><p> But is one understanding --\\n\\n like, I guess, when I started reading the briefs, I was\\n\\n confused about this, because there's one understanding\\n\\n of proximate cause, which is that usually proximate\\n\\n cause is about foreseeability and only foreseeability.\\n\\n Now, there are definitely places where we've\\n\\n said there's this additional directness requirement, but\\n\\n only in pretty discrete areas. And I guess I -- like I\\n\\n sort of come back to this notion that I think what our\\n\\n -- our precedent suggests is it's a little bit statute\\n\\n by statute as to whether proximate cause is a\\n\\n foreseeability inquiry and only that, or whether it has\\n\\n additional components.</p><p> When you say that -- when\\n\\n you said to me that the complaints that I wrote would\\n\\n have been covered by the Act, do you think it also would\\n\\n \\n fall within proximate-cause principles?</p><p> I don't read the -- the  House Report that way. The House Report does refer to a  couple of particular aspects of those cases. But the  House Report seems to me to cut against you because it  makes clear that Congress knew about those cases. And  those cases are, of course, the cases which said that  standing stretches to the limits of Article III.  And if you really look at the legislative  history of this Act, it's pretty clear that when  Congress is acting in 1988, it took off the shelf a bill  that was discussed in 1980. And in that bill, there was  a lot of discussion about whether standing should go to  the limits of Article III. And Congress was thinking of  changing that language.  And Drew Days, the Assistant Attorney  General for Civil Rights, and the HUD Secretary, they  both come in and they tell Congress, if you change that  language, it's a problem, because then you're cutting  back on standing. And Congress decided not to change  that language because it wanted, as Drew Days said and  as the HUD Secretary said, to go to the limits of  Article III.</p><p> I guess I don't understand.\\n\\n I mean, we can argue about whether these were holdings\\n\\n and whether these were a dicta, and there are arguments\\n\\n \\n on both sides of that.\\n\\n\\n\\n But here I am on Congress. I mean, suppose\\n\\n you were an advisor to a congressman. And the\\n\\n congressman said, okay. I don't really like this idea\\n\\n of going to the limits of Article III. I think we\\n\\n should limit it.\\n\\n You say, no worries. Just use the same\\n\\n language.\\n\\n And he says, use the same language? That\\n\\n language has been consistently understood to go to the\\n\\n limits of Article III.\\n\\n And you say, oh, no. Don't worry. It's\\n\\n dicta.\\n\\n And he says, okay. I feel relieved. We can\\n\\n now use this language.\\n\\n I mean, wouldn't you be fired?</p><p> I'm disabled from having\\n\\n thoughts on this subject.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>The statute doesn\\'t\\n\\n prohibit decreasing property tax values.</p><p> So -- so what -- where do  I turn next?</p><p> You want us to use the  word, the phrase, the concept \"proximate cause\" in  determining how far damages extend?</p><p> Do you think you\\'re a\\n\\n victim of discrimination?

There was no explicit statement. What the\\n\\n Court did was look at the statute, the endangered\\n\\n species statute, look at its words, and decide that \"any\\n\\n person\" meant any person and decided it did away with\\n\\n the zone of interests.\\n\\n Here, we have a Congress in 1988 taking the\\n\\n word \"aggrieved,\" which was in the -- in Title VII and\\n\\n many other statutes but undefined. And what it did was\\n\\n take the definition looked at by prior regulations,\\n\\n examined by this Court in its three cases establishing\\n\\n Article III standing, and put in a definition of\\n\\n \"aggrieved\" that is very different from the normal\\n\\n definition.</p><p> -- we have repeatedly  said -</p><p> Mr. Peck, would you go  back to the question the Chief started with, which is,  how do you define the limits of your foresee - foreseeability tests? Clearly less tourism. Less sales  tax. Less of a lot of other things can be potentially  foreseeable, but you\\'re suggesting they are not  recoverable. So is it because they are not foreseeable  or is it because they are not measurable?</p><p> The company shareholder.

Why -- how do we write that the City  has standing and its injuries are proximately caused,  but those people don\\'t?</p><p> So your answer -</p><p> Your answer, I think, to  the question is that it\\'s limited to those cognizable  suits contemplated by the statute, and you see  contemplated by the statute as having to do with the  possession or value of the property?</p><p> Well, it\\'s hard to think  that Congress didn\\'t know that in 1988, when we\\'ve  already let a village come in, in a municipality.</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.

Most of\\n\\n our cases, you're interested in the conduct of the --\\n\\n the officer and whether that conduct was reasonable and\\n\\n lacked a precedence, not an issue about whether or not\\n\\n he can be sued by the particular plaintiff. Are you\\n\\n aware of any of our cases where qualified immunity\\n\\n turned on -- in a -- a legal jurisdictional issue?\\n\\n \\n38  In other words, it's odd to say the  officer's conduct is reasonable so long as it turns out  the victim, you know, is -- is Mexican, but it's  unreasonable if the exact same conduct and it turns out  the victim is American.

ORTEGA\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MESA</p><p> The question is\\n\\n whether the government of Mexico agrees with your\\n\\n statement that the jurisdiction of the United States\\n\\n extends beyond the Mexican border.</p><p> Well, I assume\\n\\n that's true of a lot of borders.</p><p> It's because the\\n \\n\\n injury occurs in a different jurisdiction; right?</p><p> Well, but just to  stop you there. So is it any time that the U.S. officer  is in the United States that that's -- that satisfies  the question under Boumediene? It's -</p><p> Well, but the one  obvious difference with Boumediene is in there, you were  dealing with an area subject to an exclusive control of  the United States. Here, you're dealing with Mexico, an  entirely different situation.</p><p> Well, your rule  would be the same if this was the first time it  happened, if it was one person and the other facts were  the same; right?</p><p> Well, I understand\\n\\n that, but I'm trying to see what the logic is, other\\n\\n than yours happened to involve a nonmilitary actor and\\n\\n my hypothetical involves a military actor. Under a -- a\\n\\n Bivens analysis, I'm not sure that that makes a\\n\\n difference.\\n\\n Maybe there will be some defenses once you\\n\\n recognize the cause of action that have to do with the\\n\\n military operation, but I'm not sure why you wouldn't\\n\\n have a cause of action under your theory.</p><p> Well, you can  imagine a situation that is not precisely like the facts  of your case where military officials may be involved.</p><p> So if this were, in  your case, somebody from the -- the State National Guard  or whatever, then it'd be a different result?</p><p> It seems to me that  the principles you're arguing for can't be so narrowly  confined. And -- for example, how -- how do you analyze  the case of a drone strike in Iraq where the plane in  piloted from Nevada.  Why wouldn't the same analysis apply in that  case?</p><p> Well, that's a - that's a test that, surprisingly, fits the exact facts  of your case.

Let's assume this is in Mexico. Plainly in Mexico.\\n \\n\\n Would -- would you have a claim against a State or a\\n\\n\\n\\n local officer? And if not, isn't it anomalous for us to\\n\\n say that you have a claim under Bivens?</p><p> Could I ask you to go back  to Justice Kagan's question? If the -- if the officer  here was a State or a local officer, would you be able  to file a claim for damages in the United States in a  Federal court?</p><p> I mean, we can take --</p><p> -- your test point by point\\n\\n and -- and ask you whether it would apply in a situation\\n\\n where each of those factors was a little bit different.\\n\\n So the -- your client was . What if he was ? Would\\n\\n that be different?</p><p> So the rule would apply  there.</p><p> No, I understand that. But  as Justice Breyer said, we have to articulate a rule  that applies. We can't just say that in -- that -- that\\n \\n\\n on the particular facts here, there was -- the --\\n\\n\\n\\n Mr. Hernandez's -- the -- the Petitioner's have a --\\n\\n have a Bivens claim and -- and they're -- it states a\\n\\n violation of the Fourth Amendment. We have to have a\\n\\n rule to -- that can be applied in other cases.\\n\\n And I don't know what the rule -- what rule\\n\\n you want us to adopt other than to say you win. And, of\\n\\n course, that's what you -- you need to do for your\\n\\n client. But you need to give us a principle that is\\n\\n workable.\\n\\n Is it -- is your rule that if the U.S. agent\\n\\n commits on foreign soil an action that would be a\\n\\n violation had it occurred within the United States,\\n\\n there is a Bivens claim and there is a Fourth Amendment\\n\\n violation? Is that your rule?</p><p> -- the Mexican nationals.</p><p> -- crosses into Mexico and  then he shoots the -</p><p> Right. So suppose he  violates that rule.

But would you say  the rule would be different there?</p><p> What if he wasn't in this  culvert, but he was 200 yards beyond in Mexico. Would  it be different then?</p><p> All right. What if he was  armed, but he had his hands up?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>If it -- but that\\'s the  point. If, in fact, all that mattered were the  existence of a well-recognized boundary line, this case  is over. You win.  But that well-recognized boundary line was  present in Boumediene, and certainly Boumediene  suggests, while it is a factor, it is not the only  factor that determines the reach of the Fourth  Amendment. So there -- there we are. We\\'re in court,  because it is not the only factor.  And now you add in all the stuff about the  culvert and who\\'s playing there and who might be playing  there, and the 500,000 people who cross every day, and  the joint maintenance of the culvert, and the fact that\\n \\n48  all this conduct happened in the United States, that\\'s  what your opponent brother over there is trying to do.</p><p> I\\'m saying that\\'s Fourth in\\n\\n Puerto Rico.</p><p> That\\'s Eighth versus\\n\\n \\n\\n Fourth.\\n\\n44</p><p> Oh, yes. In, like, Puerto\\n\\n Rico?</p><p> Wait. Extending. You see,  there those words assume the answer to the question.  I can absolutely see you\\'re saying that if  this Court fashions a civil remedy for a violation of  the Third Amendment or the Second Amendment, you would  be extending Bivens, but I thought Bivens made  absolutely clear that where a Federal agent hurts  someone by violating the Fourth Amendment, there is a  Bivens action. Now we have an exception. And the\\n \\n\\n exception is the military.\\n\\n43\\n\\n So I think you can look at this either way.\\n\\n But I think the -- the more -- I would tend to look at\\n\\n it as saying, of course there is a Bivens remedy if\\n\\n there is a Fourth Amendment violation unless you\\'re in\\n\\n the military, which no one says this is true.\\n\\n So that\\'s how I\\'ve been thinking about the\\n\\n Bivens action. I\\'ve been thinking the answer to that\\n\\n question turns on the answer to the Fourth Amendment\\n\\n question.\\n\\n Now you can tell me why it\\'s better to use\\n\\n the words you\\'ve been using.</p><p> Well, why creating? I  would have thought if you want to say in there -</p><p> Now, let\\'s see where I\\'ve  gotten -- I\\'m trying to go somewhere with the question.</p><p> Yes. Okay.</p><p> Of course. Now, if he does\\n\\n \\n42  it in Puerto Rico, does the victim have a Bivens remedy?  I\\'ll tell you by making this up, but there never has  been a Bivens action in Puerto Rico. It\\'s the first  one.  Does he have a Bivens action?</p><p> Well, why -- why -- why do\\n\\n you use words like \"create,\" \"extend,\" et cetera,\\n\\n \"fashion,\" if, in fact, a Federal policeman, a Federal\\n\\n agent violates the Fourth Amendment and seizes someone\\n\\n unreasonably in Alaska, does the victim have a Bivens\\n\\n remedy?</p><p> But he has quite persuasive  analogies in the law with curtilages, cannon shots,  joint administration, and the purposes of the Fourth  Amendment, which is to protect the people, we can say  maybe American and maybe beyond, from unreasonable  searches. Okay? There is a set of arguments.  Limitation, absolute limitation. No worry about drones.  Flows directly from Boumediene and carries out the  purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\\n \\n36  Now, that\\'s a whole long argument. What do  you want to say?</p><p> It would be -- it would be\\n\\n \\n35  -- and that\\'s why we use their analogy. It would apply  when the action that violates the amendment takes place  in the United States and where the victim is at the  border. And \"at the border\" is defined as including  those areas that are jointly administered as part of a  border set forth in the treaty, where administration  means spending significant amounts of money on the  upkeep of those border positions; where, if you want  some additional limitation, where both American children  and Mexican children might play.  And why do we do that? Because without such  a rule, the people of the United States who might play  there, too, are not secure in -- from unreasonable  seizures such as this one.  I mean, I made that up.  (Laughter.)</p><p> No --</p><p> We do two things. We do at\\n\\n least have a commission that draws the boundary and with\\n\\n Mexico also repairs the culvert. And that\\'s expensive.\\n\\n So we do two things with Mexico there. And\\n\\n the fences are on either side of the culvert. And it is\\n\\n a border. And all -- and those things, taken together,\\n\\n either are or are not enough to apply the Fourth\\n\\n Amendment. That\\'s why I say add Justice Ginsburg\\'s\\n\\n point and add the fact that Mexico would like the Fourth\\n\\n Amendment applied.</p><p> Absolutely right. And\\n\\n here, the control is significantly diminished compared\\n\\n with the base at Guantanamo. Absolutely correct. But\\n\\n the point is -- there are other factors which we\\'ve\\n\\n heard for half an hour at least, you know, here that,\\n\\n no, suggests maybe the Fourth Amendment should apply.</p><p> Yes. Yes. Correct.\\n\\n Correct.</p><p> We know from Boumediene  that the word \"sovereign,\" and even the legal concept of  sovereign, which in Boumediene belonged to Cuba, is not  necessarily the line that distinguishes where the Fourth  Amendment does or does not apply.</p><p> We\\'d have to take as a fact  here that the children were playing. A jury could find  to the contrary, but we have to take that as a fact.</p><p> If Boumediene had control,\\n\\n who controlled the base? And here we know that this\\n\\n culvert, at least as far as paving it, keeping it up,\\n\\n spending many millions of dollars, seeing that trade, if\\n\\n it ever is filled with water, goes across and ships are\\n\\n free, et cetera, is a joint effort of Mexico and the\\n\\n United States. So this is not just like a fence. It is\\n\\n an area of two fences, and between those two areas is\\n\\n joint exercise of border maintenance authority.\\n\\n So I guess it\\'s like nothing I\\'ve seen\\n\\n before. But if it\\'s like nothing I\\'ve seen before,\\n\\n what\\'s the problem with taking Justice Ginsburg\\'s\\n\\n approach and applying it to that kind of area where, I\\n\\n might add, 500,000 people walk across it every day and\\n\\n it\\'s a fair inference that -- perhaps that American\\n\\n citizens, adolescents, play in the culvert, too.\\n\\n \\n30</p><p> No. The question -- the\\n\\n question that we -- is our problem, but we have to have\\n\\n your help in solving it, is you have a very sympathetic\\n\\n case. We write some words. And those words you\\'re\\n\\n delighted with because you win. That isn\\'t the problem.\\n\\n The problem is other people will read those\\n\\n words, and there are all kinds of things that happen,\\n\\n maybe military, maybe not. Perhaps a foreign country\\n\\n with the collusion of people in our country sets off the\\n\\n drone. That\\'s what the Chief Justice brought in.\\n\\n And are we, in deciding for you, A, deciding\\n\\n as well that anyone who suffers a drone strike can come\\n\\n to New York and bring a law case? Are we deciding that\\n\\n the matter is unclear so that when the proper\\n\\n authorities get advice from their lawyers over in the\\n\\n Executive Branch, they have to say we\\'re confused?\\n\\n Okay?\\n\\n So what are the words that we write that\\n\\n enable you to win, which is what you want, and that\\n\\n \\n\\n avoid confusion, uncertainty, or decide these other\\n\\n\\n\\n cases the proper way? That\\'s the question you\\'ve been\\n\\n given three times, and -- and I would certainly like to\\n\\n know your answer.</p><p> When I write the reason for  that, I write the opinion just as you said it, and it  says, but if it\\'s only 30 feet away, the victim, then  the Bivens action in the Fourth Amendment apply. But if  it\\'s 30 miles away or 300 miles, they don\\'t. Okay?  That\\'s what you want me to write.  Now, the next sentence has to have the  reason why I drew that distinction, and that\\'s what I  think people have been looking for. And so just please,  if -- if there\\'s anything else you have to say, I think  you don\\'t have anything else to say, but if you do, I  would say this is a good time to say it.</p><p> We know that part. The\\n\\n question is: what words do we write so that this\\n\\n opinion doesn\\'t affect the drone strike, which is what\\n\\n you seem to want?</p><p> Well, all the conduct  happens in the United States with the drones.</p><p> Same with the drones.</p><p> But that isn\\'t the\\n\\n question.</p><p> We are responsible for  maintaining it, not by ourselves, but with Mexico and  the reason we are maintaining it is because at one time\\n \\n  the whole river and now the line down the center are the  boundary, and we don\\'t want the river to jump its banks  and create new boundaries. So this is a boundary case.  Now -- now, you obviously explored that and  then I think you gave up on it. And so I would like you  to tell me what you want me to hear about it.</p><p> Okay. What about a  different approach. And I just want your reaction  because you suggested at the end of your brief, if you  have anything to add, do it. And yes, all the action  took place in the United States, but it took place at  the border. Not beyond the border. At the border.  The border is the river. We have a treaty  that says the river. We also have a treaty that says  there will be a line down the middle of the culvert, but  the culvert will be maintained by Mexico and the United\\n \\n  States jointly. And there are many documents, including  the Treaty of Hidalgo -- you know, that famous treaty  which I\\'m drawing a blank on, but -</p><p> Hidalgo, yes. Right. It\\'s  referring to the river as the border.  So it has not taken place in a foreign  country. It\\'s taking place on territory that  jurisdictionally, of course, is Mexico\\'s, but which is a  special kind of -- you -- you started talking about the  curtilage. Is there any other word? \"Curtilage\"  suggests a house. Then you started talking about cannon  shots going off somewhere. So you did research into  this.  Now, if I want to say, this is a special  kind of physical place, what words do I use?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>But I thought in Verdugo\\n\\n the -- the question was a search that occurred wholly\\n\\n inside Mexico with the cooperation of the Mexican\\n\\n authorities.</p><p> As foreign relations are  concerned, at least a Justice of this Court has said  that the behavior of our law enforcement agents abroad  sends a powerful message about the rule of law to  individuals everywhere. And you're asking us to make a  distinction that if the law enforcement agent shoots and  kills somebody who's on one side of the border, there is  Bivens liability, you tell me that. If it's just on the  other side, although the conduct is identical, the  officer is standing in exactly the same place. I don't  know what kind of powerful message about the rule of law\\n \\n\\n that would send.\\n\\n53</p><p> What do -- an anterior  question.

Your -- your brief is limited to, as you said, civilian\\n \\n\\n border patrol officers. So your drone -- your drone\\n\\n\\n\\n example, I take it from your brief, your answer is\\n\\n that's a military operation.</p><p> That's the U.S. -- U.S.\\n\\n liability, not the officer liability.</p><p> But suppose -- suppose\\n\\n the -- the victim, the same -- the same location across\\n\\n the border, but were a U.S. citizen, as Justice Breyer\\n\\n mentioned, many -- and many transients will go -- go\\n\\n across from Juarez to El Paso. Suppose it had been a\\n\\n U.S. citizen that was the victim of the shooting?</p><p> And then if it were, if  it were the young man who was grabbed by the Border  Patrol guard and shot on the U.S. side, Bivens?</p><p> Yeah, but it doesn't\\n\\n happen. We know that.</p><p> As far -</p><p> You did say in your brief\\n\\n the United States is answerable to Mexico for any\\n\\n cross-border use of force. How is the United States\\n\\n answerable to Mexico?</p><p> The responsibility to\\n\\n Mexico is prosecution in the United States? That's --</p><p> How? How?</p><p> So does it make a whole  lot of sense to say if the officer shoots somebody on  the U.S. side of the border, good Bivens claim? If the  officer standing in the same place shoots somebody who's  just across the border, no claim? That doesn't make a  whole lot of sense, does it, to distinguish those two  victims?</p><p> Are you -- are you  relying at all -- I -- I'm not sure you did in your  brief -- but there in -- in tort law, generally, when  there's an act outside that causes injury inside, the  regulating rule can come from the place where the  conduct occurred. So that that act outside, injury  inside, is a familiar category in tort law.  As I understand it, the -- the regulating  rule can come from either place, the place where the act  occurs or the place where it's effect.</p><p> Would you recognize  that -- let's say it was the -- the boy that the Border  Patrol grabbed and then shot him, so the -- the -- so  the death would have occurred in the United States,  Bivens claim?</p><p> In Verdugo, the U.S.\\n\\n officers were acting in collaboration with -- with the\\n\\n approval and cooperation of Mexican officers. That's\\n\\n quite a different case, isn't it?</p><p> How often do State\\n\\n officers act under cover of State law and outside --\\n\\n with an impact outside the United States?</p><p> Your -</p><p> But the law of the United\\n\\n States, the law is directed to an actor. The actor is\\n\\n the Border Patrol member. And the instruction from the\\n\\n United States is very clear: Do not shoot to kill an\\n\\n unarmed, nondangerous person who is no threat to your\\n\\n safety. Do not shoot to kill. That's U.S. law. And\\n\\n that's U.S. law that governs the conduct of the Border\\n\\n Patrol police.\\n\\n So I don't understand all this about Mexico.\\n\\n It's the United States law operating on the United\\n\\n States official who's acting inside the United States.\\n\\n This case has, as far as the conduct is concerned,\\n\\n United States written all over it. There's nothing\\n\\n about Mexico. The Border Patrol guard doesn't take his\\n\\n orders from Mexico.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>-- if the Border Patrol\\n\\n agent stood where he stood and took the shot he did, and\\n\\n the only difference was that the teenager in the culvert\\n\\n was an American citizen, is there a Bivens action?</p><p> I mean --</p><p> I suppose the --</p><p> Mr. Hilliard, if -</p><p> I think you said what your  rule is in a pretty clear way. You\\'ve said essentially  it\\'s a border area and the shot came from the United  States. So that, I take it, is your rule.  So it seems to me that the harder question  is actually -- and this goes back to the Chief Justice\\'s  question -- why is that your rule? You know, what makes  that confluence of factors different from everything  else?</p><p> Well, I guess you keep  saying that, Mr. Hilliard, that there\\'s a problem here,  and I respect that. But there are problems -- there  might be problems in other situations as well. There  might be problems when U.S. officials go into a foreign  nation\\'s territory. So -- so that leaves me still  uncertain why -- I mean, you\\'re saying as a practical  matter, this is where the incidents are. But is that  all you have as to why this is your rule, why the border  cases are different?</p><p> So is that -- I was trying  to figure out from your brief what exactly your rule is.  So are all five of those necessary, in your view, for  there to be a Bivens claim? Is anything else necessary?  Is that exactly the rule that you want us to adopt?</p><p> If the.</p><p> Well, we said that, but, you  know, Stanley might be the only case on your side. And  Stanley is a military case where there is like the  ultimate special factor. So for the most part, every  time we\\'ve said no Bivens, we\\'ve said because there\\'s an  alternative remedy. And here we can\\'t say that.</p><p> You\\'re quite right,  Mr. Kneedler, but there is a difference between this  case and I think -- I think all -- maybe all but one - of these other cases, which is in all of these others,  the Court has been able to point to some alternative  remedy. It might not have been the complete relief that  a plaintiff in a case wanted, but it was something. And  there was an ability to say, Congress has given you some  way to address the harm that you\\'ve suffered.  And here, there really is nothing. I mean,  there\\'s the idea that you might prosecute this person\\n \\n40  criminally, but what does the family get from that? And  anyway, you almost never do.  So -- so here, there\\'s just no remedy. And  isn\\'t that really quite different from all these other  Bivens cases that you referred to?</p><p> The dividing line isn\\'t even  marked on the ground; isn\\'t that right? You can\\'t tell  on the ground where Mexico ends and the United States  begins.  I think the point that Justice Breyer is  making is this does seem like a very -- you know, it\\'s a  sui generous kind of case. It\\'s this liminal area. I  don\\'t want to -- I don\\'t know whether to call it a  no-man\\'s land, but it\\'s this liminal area, which is kind  of neither one thing nor another thing. So maybe it\\'s  that both countries maintain it, maybe it\\'s that -- it\\'s  sort of neither country. Whatever it is, it\\'s something  very different from most areas where we know exactly  whose jurisdiction operates and how.</p><p> Well, Mr. Ortega, the rule\\n\\n is very defined. If the shot comes from U.S. territory\\n\\n and it hits somebody in the culvert, then there\\'s a --\\n\\n there\\'s a -- there\\'s an action. That\\'s a very defined\\n\\n rule. There\\'s nothing unclear about that. You can\\n\\n argue is that a good rule? Is that a bad rule? Is\\n\\n there a good reason behind that rule? But it\\'s a very\\n\\n clear rule.</p><p> Well, Mr. Ortega, you say  \"ad hoc,\" but -</p><p> I\\'m sure it wouldn\\'t have to  be written that way.  (Laughter.)</p><p> -- you get the point. The\\n\\n point of it is that it\\'s the heartland of Bivens for a\\n\\n law enforcement officer to use deadly force in violation\\n\\n of the Fourth Amendment. That\\'s the heartland of\\n\\n Bivens. We don\\'t have to make up anything new. We\\n\\n don\\'t have to extend it. We don\\'t have to create\\n\\n anything. That\\'s just Bivens.</p><p> Mr. Kneedler, you --\\n\\n Mr Kneedler: -- for private confirmations.</p><p> May I ask about an anomaly  created by your rule? I take it everybody agrees that  if there were a Texas State trooper who was involved in  the exact same conduct, that trooper, you -- you would  not be able to sue that trooper.  So why is it that Bivens, which is usually  thought of as a more limited remedy than 1983, I mean,  why should you have this situation where you can sue the  Federal agent, but not the State agent?</p><p> I\\'m sure Mexico cared a lot\\n\\n about this. The question I\\'m asking is how does the\\n\\n presence of the Bivens remedy disrupt or interfere with\\n\\n \\n\\n the United States\\' ability to carry out its foreign\\n\\n46\\n\\n policy?</p><p> -- not just the fact that it\\n\\n has something to do with another country.</p><p> The problem we would\\n\\n create --</p><p> Well, could you say -- let\\'s\\n\\n talk about that. How is this fraught with foreign\\n\\n relations issues? Because Mexico would surely prefer\\n\\n \\n\\n that -- that its citizen have a Bivens remedy.\\n\\n45\\n\\n So you seem to be using foreign relations as\\n\\n if sort of this touches some other country. But in the\\n\\n usual case, I think we\\'ve asked what\\'s the interference?\\n\\n What\\'s the disruption? So tell me what the interference\\n\\n or the disruption is.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>But that -- that means\\n\\n it's a critical area of foreign affairs.</p><p> Well, the policy of the\\n\\n United States, I suppose we can ask them if they're not\\n\\n going to give any compensation from a special bill for\\n\\n Congress or it might be picked up by an executor\\n\\n agreement, the policy of the United States is that this\\n\\n injury, a serious injury, goes unaddressed. And if we\\n\\n assume that the officer was completely at fault and that\\n\\n there's really no defense, we -- we don't know what the\\n\\n facts are, but if we assume the facts most favorably --\\n\\n favorably to you, there should be some relief.\\n\\n But isn't this an urgent matter of\\n\\n separation of powers for us to respect the duty that --\\n\\n that the -- the principle rule that the executive and\\n\\n the legislative have with respect -- respect to foreign\\n\\n affairs?</p><p> Well, my -- I -- I -- I've\\n\\n waited while the rule was being discussed because that's\\n\\n important; but as Justice Kagan's question indicates,\\n\\n whether or not there can and should be a Bivens action\\n\\n is critical to your case.\\n\\n Since 1988, this Court has not recognized a\\n\\n single Bivens action. We look for special\\n\\n considerations. You've indicated that there's a problem\\n\\n all along the border. Why doesn't that counsel us that\\n\\n this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign\\n\\n affairs where the political branches should discuss with\\n\\n Mexico what the solution ought to be? It seems to me\\n\\n that this is an extraordinary case for us to say there's\\n\\n a Bivens action in light of what we've done since 1988\\n\\n where we haven't created a single one.</p><p> Justice Ginsburg outlined  all of the U.S. factors here. Was the U.S. officer in  the United States subject to U.S. regulation? If we  were to pull the officer here under Bivens, what would  be the practical obstacles that would prevent orderly  administration of that rule? It's a U.S. officer  subject to U.S. supervision. That's it.</p><p> So, Mr. Hilliard, you want  me to put down in my notes the location of the boy is  irrelevant to this case. That's what -- that's what  we're going to put in our opinion?</p><p> That isn't a reason you  normally can give in the opinion. I -- I had a few  problems with applying it across the board. I mean,  maybe I could, but is that what I'm supposed to say?  Because it took away from the problems that Justice  Breyer had.  No, of course, you can't say that. So - so -- so what -- what is it I can say?</p><p> Of course, I guess you  could say that with reference to Bivens acts generally,  even in the United States.</p><p> So you wanted to talk  about the Fourth Amendment?</p><p> Let me ask one other  question.

In recent  years, we've been -- we have said very -- that a statute  does not apply outside the United States unless it says  that it applies outside the United States. I don't see  why that shouldn't be the same for a common-law rule  like the rule here. And if what's involved here is the  application of U.S. patent law abroad, where is the  clear statement that the exhaustion rule applies outside  of the borders of the United States? I -- I don't see  where that can be found.</p><p> Well, that's certainly a\\n\\n rather risky strategy. It seems counterintuitive that\\n\\n patentholders would pursue that. If the court that's\\n\\n going to get every patent case has adopted a particular\\n\\n rule and then just -- would you advise your client,\\n\\n well, just disregard that?</p><p> Well, the Fed -- Federal\\n\\n Circuit's rule on this is  years old.

Where does he reserve this  right? It's a right that he wants to enforce against  Joe Smith, the consumer, who bought from a German  grocery store  patented bouncing fountain pens. Okay?  Now, that's who he wants to enforce it  against. That person comes back from Germany into the  United States, and that person says, I do not know what  you're talking about. You say, don't worry, there had  to be an express reservation. So the question I thought  was, where? Is it a sticker or not?</p><p> So in other words, the  answer is yes. Every widget has to have a sticker.</p><p> Does he have to put a\\n\\n sticker on every toy? Does he have to put a sticker --\\n\\n how? How does it work?</p><p> What about\\n\\n Justice Kennedy's question? I mean, Lord Coke had that\\n\\n very question in mind, I think, that -- that one of the\\n\\n problems with restraints in alienation of chattel is\\n\\n that the buyer may not know, and -- and moreover, it\\n\\n stops competition among buyers. Those are the basic two\\n\\n things that have led that as a kind of underlying\\n\\n principle. Well, what about it?</p><p> -- in saying whatever you\\n\\n think of the U.S., there's a big difference here. They\\n\\n haven't gotten any money back on their --</p><p> And I'm just trying to get\\n\\n your answer to their argument --</p><p> I know your submission is\\n\\n no.</p><p> No. I'm saying do sales\\n\\n under foreign laws in foreign countries -- that's the\\n\\n question -- once there has been such a sale, does the\\n\\n patentee still have the right under his American patent\\n\\n \\n\\n to restrict the use of that widget, that particular\\n\\n\\n\\n widget, bought by the buyer in Bavaria.</p><p> All sales were authorized.\\n\\n In the one sale, it was sold in Bavaria under a German\\n\\n patent. And not only was it authorized by the American,\\n\\n but he said, I love it. And so what I want to you do is\\n\\n whenever you use it, you put a big red sign with my name\\n\\n on it. All right? There's a condition.</p><p> Uh-huh.</p><p> Either way, they're suing\\n\\n under American law and this person has violated the\\n\\n patent or he hasn't violated the American patent.\\n\\n And when we start talking abroad, you are\\n\\n quite right, I think, that Lord Coke and his great\\n\\n principle of no alienation on chattels is being laughed\\n\\n at. All right. That's your argument. But on the other\\n\\n side, they have just received money for that first sale\\n\\n under, let's say, a German patent, and they have not\\n\\n received any money on this American patent. So they\\n\\n say, well, how could you be subjecting us to a rule that\\n\\n that first sale exhausted our right to money under the\\n\\n American patent when we never received any money under\\n\\n the American patent?\\n\\n Now -- so there's one thing one way and\\n\\n there's one important thing the other way. So how do\\n\\n \\n\\n you react?</p><p> The argument the other  side, which I think is the more difficult part, I  absolutely see your point. In both instances, whether  you or the other side wins, we're talking about  something that happened where there's a lawsuit in the\\n \\n\\n United States and there was a restriction that the\\n\\n\\n\\n patentee imposed. He said anyone who buys my widget\\n\\n cannot resell it to Smith or Jones. Or anyone who buys\\n\\n my widget, if they resell it, has to put a big red sign\\n\\n on it, some kind of restriction. If somebody fails to\\n\\n do that, so they sue likely in the United States, but in\\n\\n any case, they're suing under American law; right?\\n\\n Either way.</p><p> And that -- and you agree  you're for that, but that is very much contrary to what  300 years of restraints on alienation had in mind.  One of the problems was that people who buy  these things, namely, those who go into grocery store or  whatever, don't know that they can't bring it back to  the U.S., or they don't know that they can't do this or  they can't do that or have to have the red sign or  whatever. And you don't have an answer to that, I take  it.</p><p> Why can't you enforce the  contract downstream?</p><p> Well, there's a -- there\\n\\n a -- Nike, two things. When they say well, people have\\n\\n authorized dealers, and anyone who's in business knows\\n\\n you want to be safe, buy it from an authorized dealer.\\n\\n That isn't a big problem.\\n\\n On the other hand, if you are a consumer\\n\\n enured to do, it isn't -- I don't think I followed quite\\n\\n \\n\\n what you're saying. If there is a first sale rule,\\n\\n43\\n\\n no -- you know, first sale, no problem. The only\\n\\n problem is you bought it from a guy who didn't have a\\n\\n patent in the first place. So go buy it from GE, or buy\\n\\n it from Amazon, or buy it from somebody you know, you\\n\\n trust, and that's the end of that.\\n\\n But if there is no first-sale rule, there we\\n\\n are, got to have the red sign, got to have -- can't sell\\n\\n it here, can't sell it there, can't sell it some other\\n\\n place. Who knows what the -- now -- now, that's the\\n\\n kind of confusion, and of course there is no sticker,\\n\\n that's the kind of confusion that they're afraid of.</p><p> There -- there -- there are  quite -- I mean, I agree that there are all kinds of  exceptions.  But to go back to your basic point  underlying this, of course, any monopolist, including a  patent monopolist, would love to be able to go to each  buyer separately and extract from each buyer and user  the maximum amount he would pay for that particular\\n \\n\\n item. Dentists would pay more for gold perhaps than\\n\\n36\\n\\n someone who wants to use gold for some other thing.\\n\\n Okay? They'd like that. But by and large, that's\\n\\n forbidden under many laws, even though it does mean\\n\\n slightly restricted output, and it also means a lower\\n\\n profit for the monopolist.\\n\\n All right. Now, it's against that\\n\\n background that I think the law and economics\\n\\n professors, who are telling what is correct, that -- and\\n\\n the argument that you're making has to be evaluated.\\n\\n That's what I think on the first part. All this\\n\\n precedent is very hard for you to get around. And I'm\\n\\n not talking about just Lord Coke; I'm talking about the\\n\\n Supreme Court precedent.</p><p> This is the reserved\\n\\n question. I see your point there. If you want to\\n\\n continue to make it for others, go ahead. Go ahead.\\n\\n Finish, because I -- I think I interrupted you.</p><p> Sure. And one of the  reasons that it's hard to get away with that is the  antitrust laws in the contract area. And another reason\\n \\n\\n is because Lord Coke said 300 years ago, you know,\\n\\n34\\n\\n it's -- you get into a lot of trouble when you start\\n\\n trying to restrict this buyer who's got the widget and\\n\\n he would like to use it as he wishes. Now, that's been\\n\\n the kind of basic legal principle for an awfully long\\n\\n time.</p><p> Then why don't you require  the person who sells it to just resell it with the  requirement that they promise not to, you know, whatever  it is?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>-- \"Do not sell\"?

Don't pretend that you're\\n\\n implementing Congress' intent when you look at what\\n\\n Congress -- a Congress 60 years later would do.</p><p> But let's say, when\\n\\n we're looking at a question of congressional intent and\\n\\n a question of this, we look at what a Congress 60 years\\n\\n later would have thought.</p><p> And I don't think\\n\\n there are any, but -- you haven't found one, and I don't\\n\\n think anyone could find one.</p><p> We're going to find  lots of cases when we address this question that talks\\n \\n about the intent of the Congress that passed the\\n\\n46\\n\\n statute.</p><p> So do -- do I  understand you to agree that when we approach these  questions, severance and remedy, that we do look at what  the Congress at the time when they passed the law would  have done?</p><p> What would their  understanding have been about the appropriate remedy  when they passed the statute?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>I mean, you can conceive\\n\\n the -- the possibility of members of Congress in 1940 or\\n\\n 1952 taking the floor and arguing, you know, we need to\\n\\n discriminate against the children of married parents,\\n\\n and in favor of the children of unmarried parents.</p><p> In 1940 you think that was\\n \\n Congress' intent.\\n\\n37</p><p> And you think that was  Congress' intent in 1952?</p><p> And have we ever said there\\n\\n would be a different level of scrutiny if the\\n\\n discrimination was against children who were born to\\n\\n married parents? Would you make that argument?</p><p> Yeah. But to children who\\n\\n are born to unmarried mothers, but not to children who\\n\\n are born to unmarried fathers, and you would extend the\\n\\n problem. You would have this Court extend the problem.\\n\\n \\n36</p><p> The underlying criminal  convictions.</p><p> Well, could you address  that? We -- we had a similar issue a few terms ago in  the Flores-Villar case, but that was a criminal - there, what was at issue was a criminal conviction.  Here, criminal convictions are not at issue. The  criminal convictions had nothing to do with alienage; is  that correct?</p><p> Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you  this question: If the Court thinks that this statute  violates the Equal Protection Clause, does it  necessarily follow that the Petitioner is entitled to  the relief that was awarded to him by the Second  Circuit; in other words, the granting of citizenship?</p><p> If Petitioner's parents had  been married, would he be entitled to relief?</p><p> If we were to -- if we were  to level up, we would -</p><p> If we were to level up, the  effect would be that Petitioner would be given  preference over someone who was similarly situated  except for the fact that that person's parents were  married.</p><p> And if such a person were to  then bring a suit, they would have a strong equal  protection claim, would they not?</p><p> Well, it would be a\\n\\n legitimacy discrimination. The -- the laws that are --\\n\\n what are they subject to, and the case -- the past cases\\n\\n have involved discrimination against the children of\\n\\n unwed parents. And what has -- what is the standard of\\n\\n review there?</p><p> Well, that is true, but  isn't it something else when we devise a remedy that  deepens and extends an equal protection violation? Have  we ever done that?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>There\\'s a lot of  complicated things, but the question I think is, think  of the child. The child is born out of wedlock. Now,  if his mother was an American, he becomes an American if  she\\'s lived here for one year. If it\\'s his father who\\'s  an American, she becomes an American only if he\\'s lived  here for like eight years or ten years. Now, that\\'s the\\n \\n  difference, and why does that make a difference? What  justifies the gender discrimination?</p><p> Two -- two wrongs don\\'t  make a right.</p><p> Perhaps. Yeah, yeah, I  accept that no one is challenging, but I\\'m not asking  that question.  I\\'m asking the question of what it is -- I  would repeat the question, which you heard, which I  think is the equal protection question at the heart of  the case.</p><p> And the answer that you  give in your brief was some endlessly -- I mean, it was  very well-written and brilliant - (Laughter.)</p><p> -- and -- and -- but it  went into this thing about statelessness persons, and - and then we have, like,  briefs that say, no, no, that  wasn\\'t what the situation was with statelessness  persons. And so I guess the question would be there:\\n \\n  Was it enough of a statelessness person justification to  warrant this gender discrimination?  There is no point in you repeating that. I  think I\\'ve taken in that argument. I\\'ll have to make up  my mind about it.  Is there anything else?</p><p> Wrong -- wrong residency  requirement. I did have Justice Kagan\\'s question in  mind when they read it.  Why don\\'t they ask the child if it would  like, when it reaches the age of , to be connected to  the United States and see if the child votes in American  elections and lives there a while? Why are they so  worried about the child\\'s parents?</p><p> I mean, in any case, you  don\\'t have to answer that.</p><p> Lived here for  years and\\n\\n so forth. All kinds of stuff. But --</p><p> I don\\'t want to argue with\\n\\n you on this point. I want to know if I\\'ve got the\\n\\n reason for saying the mother, if she\\'s the U.S. citizen\\n\\n and he is born out of wedlock, he only lived here for a\\n\\n year, but the father has to live here for, like, ten\\n\\n years or eight years or something like that, the real\\n\\n justification for that you\\'ve been able to find and the\\n\\n only one you\\'ve been able to find has to do with this\\n\\n thing about statelessness?</p><p> I\\'m going to make an\\n\\n example where they never married.</p><p> They -- they like living  together without being married. Now what\\'s the  justification?</p><p> One I could think of -- one\\n\\n I could think of, possibly, but I\\'d like your opinion\\n\\n about it: How many, do you think, unmarried fathers\\n\\n there were in 1952 who couldn\\'t qualify under the long\\n\\n period of time -- eight years, you know -- and that\\'s\\n\\n not so hard to do, if you\\'re in the Army, because all\\n\\n your active duty counts. But they would have qualified\\n\\n under the one year. Now, I use the numbers in your\\n\\n brief, which were brilliant of you to try to find. I\\n\\n don\\'t know how you found those.\\n\\n But I -- I -- that ,000 number kept coming\\n\\n \\n  back. I thought maybe there were a couple of thousand a  year. But do we know that there are more than a couple  of thousand a year?</p><p> Well, and there were the  untold numbers, but that\\'s -- that\\'s true, they\\'re  untold numbers, and then that\\'s not told. I\\'m trying to  find the - (Laughter.)</p><p> I\\'m trying to find how  close we could come to a guess.</p><p> Let\\'s go back to \\'52, and  the couple is unmarried and it\\'s a father who, in fact,  would qualify if he only had to live here for a year,  but he wouldn\\'t qualify if he had to live here for eight  years before the baby\\'s born. Never marries the baby --\\n \\n never marries the mother. Okay.\\n\\n\\n\\n So I\\'m thinking, who could those people have\\n\\n been? They would have been -- they would have been\\n\\n people maybe working for American businesses or\\n\\n something, and there weren\\'t that many at that time. So\\n\\n I -- I used your ,000.</p><p> Well, let\\'s go back to \\'52.</p><p> Now, suppose just the words  you said, take the same words, just put in \"father\"  instead of \"mother,\" and today why is it any different?\\n \\n56</p><p> I\\'m not talking about  legitimacy. I\\'m talking about the ones -- a surprising  number of people, unfortunately, never get married. And  a lot of them do live abroad, and they do have children.</p><p> So that\\'s one focus. And  certainly your words applied where it is the mother.  And all my question is, couldn\\'t you take those same  words and apply it where it is the father?</p><p> Doesn\\'t (c) say that?  Doesn\\'t (c) say that?</p><p> But today there are - today there are lots of fathers who do look after their  children. I don\\'t say they do it perfectly, but they  try.</p><p> In 1409(a). And what the  first words of (c) are, \"notwithstanding the provision  of subsection A.\" Anyway, I guess I could figure it out  later.</p><p> It says: \"Notwithstanding\\n\\n subsection (a), somebody who is born outside the U.S.\\n\\n out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth\\n\\n the nationality status of his mother if the mother is a\\n\\n U.S. citizen and had been physically in the United\\n\\n States for one year.\"\\n\\n So I don\\'t see anything that says they have\\n\\n to be legitimized for the mother to get that.\\n\\n \\n51</p><p> That perhaps was not right.</p><p> Yeah. What if the --</p><p> On this, but -- I would say  at some point, the problem that worries me the most is,  assuming this is unconstitutional, do you put the   years or whatever it is, ten years, on both, or the one  year on both?  And I -- I want to -- because he does have a  point. You put the one year on both and then you have,  when the parents are married, it\\'s the ten years, and  when it\\'s the -- they\\'re not married, it\\'s the one year,  and that really doesn\\'t make much sense. But the - the -- so I\\'m -- I\\'m -- hope you\\'ll get to that.\\n \\n  And in the course of that, I read an amicus  brief that bothered me a lot, and it said, actually, the  one-year requirement is tougher. And the reason it\\'s  tougher, it says that the State Department administers  it. How they do this, I don\\'t know, and I want to know  if that\\'s really true.  But they administer it to say that if you  are living in the United States you have to live here  for one year. And if you set one foot across the board  to get a drink of water at -- at Niagara Falls, you  don\\'t qualify. And, moreover, you have to prove that  you never did set one foot to get a drink of water.  Well, nobody could prove such a thing. So -- so I\\'m  interested in that word \"continuous\" and how it is  actually administered.  Those are the two things that are worrying  me in respect to remedy.</p><p> All right. So I -- I --\\n\\n that question. That is your answer. And maybe, if the\\n\\n Solicitor General has time, he could simply confirm that\\n\\n answer by saying yes.</p><p> Why -- why -- why did you  use the word \"today\"? I thought what we were supposed  to do is go back and figure out if they had known that  it was unconstitutional to give the unmarried woman a\\n \\n43  year requirement to live in the United States, but to  give the unmarried man where he is a citizen eight  years\\' requirement, suppose they had known that was  unconstitutional then, what would they have done then?  Is it then or is it now?</p><p> It\\'s a lot easier for you  if it is now, I think.</p><p> But -- but -- but which is  it -- is there anything -- I mean, you know, you are not  going to help me if you just say that because that\\'s in  your interest to say. Is there anything that -- that  you could -- you could point to that would say it\\'s now  and not then?</p><p> Did you find any case which  supports that?</p><p> That\\'s true. But you can\\n\\n ask, what would they have wanted if they knew they\\n\\n couldn\\'t make this discrimination? That\\'s why I\\n\\n thought, well, if you have to go back to \\'52, they\\'re\\n\\n going to either have to take the benefit away from the\\n\\n woman or give it to the man. And the two principles\\n\\n that support you is Congress hates taking away a benefit\\n\\n they give anybody. They get into a lot of trouble when\\n\\n they take benefits away.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> So that would move them in\\n\\n one direction. And it would also move them in the same\\n\\n \\n48  direction if there are just a handful of them who might  really benefit. That\\'s why I asked that question. But  nobody -- but if there were millions of men who might  benefit, then they might get a little worried about what  they\\'re doing, particularly since they\\'re discriminating  even more, you know, the other way against the married  couple.  So that\\'s why I was interested in those  questions. But I take it you have said pretty much what  you can say on that.</p><p> Where is the legitimation\\n\\n requirement? I see  U.S.C. 1409(c). It doesn\\'t say a\\n\\n word about legitimation.</p><p> Well, 1409(a) doesn\\'t\\n\\n apply. It says \"notwithstanding subsection A.\"</p><p> Did you find any case  against it?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>There are many cases,  especially generations back when this law was on the\\n \\n books, where the mother -- the birth certificate came\\n\\n\\n\\n sometime after the child was born, and both the father's\\n\\n name and the mother's name might be on it.\\n\\n So it is -- it is not -- the moment of birth\\n\\n doesn't necessarily tell you who is the mother if she --\\n\\n if there is no birth certificate, and then the child,\\n\\n when they get the birth certificate, both names are on\\n\\n it.</p><p> Why aren't men and women  who are parents similarly situated with respect to their  affiliation, their attachment to U.S. values? I mean,  there's no reason to think a man is less -- has less of  a sense of U.S. belonging than a woman?</p><p> Mr. Kneedler, you're - you are giving a sophisticated rationale, but we're  talking about legislation from 1940 and 1952.  At that time, the statute books were just  shot through with distinctions between children born out  of wedlock and affiliation with the mother and the  father. So this was a piece with all that legislation.  And it wasn't until when Ms. Trimble again scored a  typical. And the Illinois Probate Code said a child  born out of wedlock can inherent to an intestate  succession from the mother only, not the father. The\\n \\n laws just put mothers and children not born of the\\n\\n\\n\\n marriage together and separated fathers from their\\n\\n children.</p><p> And nobody thought until\\n\\n the 1970s that that was a violation of equal protection.\\n\\n But in a whole series of cases in the '70s, the Court\\n\\n recognized that, indeed, there was a violation of equal\\n\\n protection.</p><p> My point was that the\\n\\n laws that existed put mothers and children born out of\\n\\n wedlock together and separated fathers from their\\n\\n children --</p><p> What about the argument\\n\\n that in most of the cases where a benefit was extended,\\n\\n the -- the group that -- to which the benefit was\\n\\n extended was a smaller group than the group that already\\n\\n got the benefit, and here, if you add in married\\n\\n parents, then most people are under the more difficult\\n\\n rule, ten years or whatever it is, and it's the smaller\\n\\n group that gets the benefit.</p><p> Mr. Kneedler, the claim  is gender discrimination. And married parents, they  both have been -- mother and father have been treated  equally badly. But when they are unwed, the mother is  given the preference and the father is not. So we're - we're talking about equal protection, not qualified  immunity. You have two people, similarly situated.  They have to be treated equally. The unwed father is  equal to the unwed mother. The married mother, equal to  the married father. So --</p><p> The claim -- the claim -</p><p> -- out of what the\\n\\n reality of their life was.</p><p> That was not a claim of  citizenship.</p><p> It's not -- it's not  citizenship. It's excising the unconstitutional part of  the statute.</p><p> And the father did - this father -- didn't the couple marry?</p><p> So you would be extending  a benefit enjoyed by a smaller group to a larger group.</p><p> But wouldn't you have an  anomaly, then, that parents who are not married are  preferred to parents who are married?</p><p> As to the number - number of people, all you can say is they would have to  meet a lot of requirements that you would have -- the  U.S. citizen sired a child abroad, recognize that child,  supported that child, and -</p><p> Is that true -- is that\\n\\n true of, say, Westcott when they -- the category was\\n\\n unemployed father and -- and it was enlarged to include\\n\\n unemployed mothers? Is it true of Goldfarb, the Social\\n\\n Security cases when -- what Congress did when it did it\\n\\n was just a piece with everything where the man was the\\n\\n dominant person in the family and the woman was the\\n\\n subordinate person.\\n\\n So to say we want to go back to a Congress\\n\\n that had that mindset and ask what they would have done\\n\\n \\n is a little hard.\\n\\n47</p><p> What the Court -- the  Congress in '40 or '52 would do is strange in this  context, because the Court -- the Congress sitting then  took gender-based lines for granted.</p><p> They were giving -- they\\n\\n were -- the one thing I think is they were giving a\\n\\n benefit to the unmarried mother.</p><p> Because they thought she\\n\\n was different from the unmarried father.\\n\\n \\n38</p><p> And the legitimacy.</p><p> So I don't think that --</p><p> What relief -- the relief\\n\\n would have been granted to this person. This is not\\n\\n some kind of class action.</p><p> More than that, I think\\n \\n it would be -- at first the father would have had to\\n\\n40\\n\\n have sired this child abroad, would have had to\\n\\n recognized the child, would have had to support the\\n\\n child.</p><p> Whatever it is, it\\n \\n wouldn't be gender discrimination.\\n\\n35</p><p> Is that -- that's  statutory and also the support requirement. Now, they  may be independently challengeable, but they are -</p><p> Or if she is already\\n\\n married.</p><p> But if you're concerned  about the stateless children in the world, then -- if - if you have a problem with the father who can't transmit  his citizenship in a country where women citizenship  goes by who is the father.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>Mr. Kneedler -</p><p> But before you -- before you\\n\\n do that, Mr. Broome, just on the remedy question, very\\n\\n occasionally this Court has faced a situation when the\\n\\n natural remedy of something that it is holding. We were\\n\\n concerned a little bit about how -- whether Congress\\n\\n would prefer a different remedy.\\n\\n So, for example, in the Northern Pipeline\\n\\n case, what we did in a situation like that was we stayed\\n\\n our judgment for a period of time and allowed Congress\\n\\n essentially to do it a different way if it wanted to.\\n\\n And I'm wondering whether you had considered that\\n\\n possibility here, that we could order a kind of\\n\\n leveling-up judgment but stay it for some period of time\\n\\n so that Congress could decide whether it instead\\n\\n preferred some other way of dealing with the problem,\\n\\n \\n whether that would be appropriate?\\n\\n41</p><p> Either by leveling down or\\n\\n by leveling up.</p><p> Could I -- I'm sorry. Were\\n\\n you finished?</p><p> Could I -- I mean, we\\n\\n generally have a rule that when we find an equal\\n\\n \\n protection violation, we level up rather than level\\n\\n\\n\\n down. That's been the Court's consistent practice.\\n\\n Wouldn't you agree?</p><p> Well, I find one compelling\\n\\n reason to do it -- and I just thought I'd offer this up\\n\\n to you and see what you have to say -- is that in this\\n\\n case, unlike in some cases, there really isn't a choice\\n\\n between leveling up and leveling down in one sense,\\n\\n because if you level down, this party gets no relief.\\n\\n In other words, you say, well, you level --\\n\\n you just apply it prospectively. But then this party\\n\\n gets absolutely no relief. And so isn't that a problem?\\n\\n Isn't it the kind of the same problem as Justice Harlan\\n\\n recognized in -- in Welsh when he was dealing with a\\n\\n criminal matter? He said, you know, you can't level\\n\\n down because you can't give everybody the exact same\\n\\n benefit.\\n\\n So how do we deal with that?</p><p> But not really a situation  like this. Not a situation where we say, uh, there is  an equal protection violation, and if we extend the  benefit to everybody, we can take care of that equal  protection violation, we can remedy the problem. But if  we do not, if we try to level down, the effect of that  is that the -- the party before us who has proved an  equal protection violation gets absolutely no relief at  all.</p><p> I mean, the problem, isn't  it, Mr. Broome, that the very inequality that you are  complaining of would remain, because it's impossible to  claw back everybody else's citizenship, so it's really  impossible to level down. And the very inequality that  we've just found would remain.</p><p> But it's not just that it  doesn't give you citizenship, it's that it doesn't cure  the inequality at all.</p><p> That would get rid of the  gender inequality that is at the heart of his complaint.  Whether or not he in the end benefits from it, the  question here is whether the statute makes - constitutes a violation of equal protection.  One question we ask when we think about a  question like that is, could Congress have written the  statute? Could Congress have served its objectives in  an entirely gender neutral way? And it seems as though  here we have the -- the Secretary of State presented a  statute to Congress that actually did that.</p><p> But why do we look,\\n\\n \\n  Mr. Kneedler, to the moment of birth? Why shouldn't we  look to the moment when citizenship is sought?</p><p> Why couldn't that have been  done, Mr. Kneedler? Why couldn't these objectives have  been served through entirely gender neutral language?  For example, I know that there was a proposal that the\\n \\n  Secretary of State made earlier than this statute was  passed in the 1930s, which talked just about legal  parents, which didn't refer to mothers and fathers at  all.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>You know, I thought -- I  thought you said there were untold numbers.</p><p> Go ahead.</p><p> If we leveled down and\\n\\n made it harder, would that affect the status of people\\n\\n who have obtained citizenship under the more lenient\\n\\n provision applicable to the mother?</p><p> Well, it's not\\n\\n necessary -- I assume it could be prospective because\\n\\n once you have citizenship, it's -- we -- we have cases\\n\\n that say it can't be taken away.\\n\\n \\n32</p><p> Suppose -- suppose there  were some statistics that would indicate that over  100,000 new citizens would qualify or new persons  would -- would qualify for citizenship if -- if we  adopted leveling up. Would that affect our -- should  that affect our decision?</p><p> And outside would gain  200,000.</p><p> Don't we have to consider  what the Congress likely would have intended?</p><p> So it would just be  prospective by reason of that doctrine.</p><p> Justice Kagan's\\n\\n suggestion, Congress apparently should -- should have\\n\\n been aware of this after our Flores-Villar, but they\\n\\n were soporific.\\n\\n (Laughter.)\\n\\n \\n42</p><p> Well, are --</p><p> I take it that the thrust\\n \\n of Justice Alito's question is, what -- what is the\\n\\n\\n\\n remedy if we -- if we level up, then it's easier for\\n\\n both? If we level down, then -- then it's harder for\\n\\n both?</p><p> But Nguyen -- Nguyen was  more a matter of -- of proof, whereas this case, as\\n \\n Justice Ginsburg indicates, is a question of which --\\n\\n\\n\\n does the child have sufficient ties to the country.\\n\\n It's quite a different -- quite a different proposition\\n\\n that the two address, it seems to me.</p><p> And -- and here your\\n\\n argument is -- the thrust of your argument is -- is\\n\\n somewhat a different need to ensure sufficient ties.</p><p> I thought, in Villar,\\n\\n the -- the government spent most of its argument talking\\n\\n about the differential treatment primarily on the\\n\\n grounds of statelessness.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>The continuous one year.</p><p> Which means? The answer  is yes?</p><p> I'm sorry. If we  leveled up, how would that affect children who were born  to an -- to a citizen father, who were previously denied  citizenship, could they come in and claim citizenship  now?</p><p> So why should it be  different for an unwed father who has legitimized the  child?</p><p> The problem is with the\\n\\n exception that's been created for unwed-citizen mothers,\\n\\n the first prong, the interest of the connection to the\\n\\n United States doesn't exist, because the statute doesn't\\n\\n require any connection to the United States except\\n\\n U.S. citizenship. She could have been born, lived here\\n\\n a day, and moved somewhere else, and she would\\n\\n automatically confer.</p><p> So there is a risk of  statelessness no matter what?</p><p> So what happens to a\\n\\n citizen mother who can't meet that one-year requirement?\\n\\n What happens to her child?</p><p> I just said they do.\\n\\n Because the mother can only pass on citizenship if she's\\n\\n been in the United States continuously for one year\\n\\n prior to the birth of the child, correct?</p><p> Well, we aren't leaving\\n\\n children uncovered whose mothers have not had a\\n\\n continuous one-year residency in the United States, even\\n\\n though that mother may be an American citizen.</p><p> Perhaps you're assuming\\n \\n49  Justice Ginsburg's point that the father still has to  have legitimatized the child without marriage. Because  if they married the mother, they would end up having to  fulfill the five-year. So it would have to be -- are  you accepting her proposition that the father has to  legitimatize the child?</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>It's a little\\n\\n difficult to -- you said look at the text and history.\\n\\n We don't have a lot of history here concerning access to\\n\\n websites and all the sort of things we're dealing with\\n\\n here.

So suppose the\\n\\n State enacted a law prohibiting anyone convicted of\\n\\n kidnapping children from visiting a nursery school.\\n\\n Would -- would that be a violation of the First\\n\\n Amendment?</p><p> All right. Suppose it\\n\\n was --</p><p> -- in the District of\\n\\n Columbia.</p><p> But you think that even as\\n\\n narrowly tailored as Justice Ginsburg's example, so it\\n\\n would be a crime for a convicted sex offender -- or\\n\\n let's say someone who was convicted previously of\\n\\n committing a sex offense using the Internet from\\n\\n contacting on the Internet a person who is known --\\n\\n known by that person to be a minor without the consent\\n\\n of the parents of the minor? That would be a violation\\n\\n of the First Amendment?</p><p> Yeah, the -- the\\n\\n interpretation that Justice Breyer -- the -- the\\n\\n language that Justice Breyer is referring to and other\\n\\n language in this statute, I think, could, for the\\n\\n purpose of avoiding First Amendment problems, be limited\\n\\n to core social networking sites, including Facebook and\\n\\n things like Facebook, Google Plus, that sort of thing,\\n\\n and excluding a lot of the other sites that the\\n\\n electronic frontier says are included, like the New York\\n\\n Times and Betty Crocker and things like that. So it\\n\\n would be limited just to social networking sites.\\n\\n Would you agree that it could be read at --\\n\\n using constitutional avoidance, it could be narrowed to\\n\\n at least those?</p><p> Well, you know, you might\\n\\n read this to -- you might read a personal profile to\\n\\n mean something more than just a nickname. A personal\\n\\n profile -- the definition of a profile is a concise\\n\\n biographical sketch, which seems to be -- seems to refer\\n\\n to enough information so that you can get a -- an idea\\n\\n about who the person is.\\n\\n Why don't you read it that way? And if you\\n\\n read it that way, would it include nytimes.com?</p><p> Well, I'm saying suppose we  think that -- that it's a stretch to get to links, but  it does require a personal profile, and I wouldn't think  that just a nickname. Somebody says my nickname is, I  don't know what, Joe, that that's a -- that's a profile?</p><p> Okay.</p><p> Well, suppose this case had  come to us in 2003, before Facebook was created. Would  there be alternative channels then?</p><p> But -</p><p> But what I'm asking is  whether the existence of alternative channels asks  whether these are channels that people like to use or  whether if the channels that are affected by the statute  are taken away, there are still alternative channels.  Now, I know there are people who think that  life is not possible without Twitter and Facebook and\\n \\n\\n these things and that 2003 was the dark ages.\\n\\n55\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Even if it were limited  to -- to those -</p><p> You would say it's  unconstitutional.</p><p> Well, just to put it in - in context. It -- it is important for purposes of an  as-applied challenge because if -- what your -- what  your client used was a social -- was Facebook, right?</p><p> But I don't know that --\\n\\n that any channels of communication that were available\\n\\n at that time have been taken away. So if there were\\n\\n alternative channels then, why would there not be\\n\\n alternative channels now?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Why?</p><p> Why?\\n\\n35</p><p> Does that make a  difference?</p><p> I exaggerate. Let\\'s just  stick with the -- we can\\'t have convicted swindlers  going on Facebook to discuss money.</p><p> We can think of -- you  know, pretty soon, you\\'re going to have everybody  convicted of different things not being able to go  anywhere and discuss anything.</p><p> I mean, I can multiply  these examples. Convicted -</p><p> Can you have a statute says  convicted swindlers cannot go on Facebook -- or cannot  go on the Internet on sites that tell people -- that  tell people where to gather to discuss money?</p><p> What\\'s the difference?</p><p> What about all the\\n  orders -- about all the ways you just listed that they  have all the statutes would say you can\\'t approach  children and say certain things. You remember you  started that way.</p><p> Maybe those have the same  problem. I mean, why -- why? Why are we trying to  limit that? People all the time want to speak to  -year-olds, -year-olds. It doesn\\'t -- it doesn\\'t  limit this even to those that have sex problems with  children. All right? This is -- this is everybody  who\\'s ever had a sex offense.  And you\\'re not -- you\\'re, I take it, you\\'re  rejecting any effort that I might have hypothetically  made to narrow the statute, and you\\'re saying, hey,  nowhere. Nowhere, really, because children are  everywhere. And I don\\'t -- what is the difference? I  want to go to a park and I want to talk to -year-olds  about helping get some petition drives. You know, I can  make endless examples.  So what\\'s the basis here? The State has a  reason? Yeah, it does. Does it limit free speech?  Dramatically. Are there other, less restrictive ways of  doing it? We\\'re not sure, but we think probably, as  you\\'ve mentioned some. Okay. End of case, right?</p><p> Now, we\\'re going to have 40\\n \\n\\n other cases involved.</p><p> So then the answer to this  would be they have not applied it that way here, and  given the way they\\'ve applied it here, they can\\'t do  that.</p><p> I think I can say that.  Now, if I say that, is it constitutional? That\\'s what  I\\'m trying to get your answer to.</p><p> If -- if that\\'s -- it does\\n\\n what it says, facilities the social introduction between\\n\\n two or more persons for the purposes of friendship,\\n\\n \\n  meeting other persons or related information exchanges.  I\\'ve now got it a social dating or equivalent site.</p><p> -- seems to be talking\\n\\n about dating sites or the lower age level equivalent.</p><p> Wait. Don\\'t you see, all\\n\\n I\\'m doing is reading one word before information\\n\\n exchange. And the word I\\'m reading is related\\n\\n information exchange. And as so interpreted, that\\n\\n clause, too, which you\\'re much more familiar with than I\\n\\n am --</p><p> I want to get your answer\\n\\n to the question.</p><p> That\\'s -- then we\\'re back\\n \\n\\n to my question. So I\\'m treating it as an as-applied\\n\\n\\n\\n challenge. I don\\'t want to just repeat the question.</p><p> Okay.</p><p> You\\'re not -- you\\'re not  attacking the statute. You\\'re only attacking it applied  to your client?</p><p> But I\\'m really interested  in the narrow possibility of interpreting it narrowly,  as I said. And on that basis, it\\'s facially  constitutional, though it could be applied  unconstitutionally. That\\'s what I want your answer to.</p><p> Yeah. But that\\'s what I - I wanted to be -- I wanted to get your answer, and I  think I have that.</p><p> If that\\'s constitutional,  instead of what most of the briefs do, is interpret the  statute as broadly as possible, this is a facial  challenge. What about trying to interpret it as  narrowly as possible? And as narrowly as possible, it  seems to me a necessary condition is that a violator  cannot go to a site that facilitates the social  introduction between two or more persons, and these  are -- these are children they\\'re talking about, I  guess -- for two or more persons for the purposes of  friendship, meeting other persons, or information  exchanges. So we have to say \"or related information  exchanges.\"  And now we have a definition that sounds as  if they\\'re talking about dating sites, or it sounds as  if they\\'re talking about related play group sites, if  you take younger children. And is it possible to read  it that way? And if you do read it that way, is it  constitutional?</p><p> All right.</p><p> What is -- what was your  answer? Which I forget. A statute prohibits a  convicted sex offender from being -- spending more than  five minutes at a children\\'s playground. Is that  constitutional or not?</p><p> Look -- look: The case  books are filled with cases where to allow certain  groups of people to speak is actually dangerous. Like  the communists under -- you know, years ago, they said\\n \\n39  it was a good idea to have a revolution. And all kinds  of people have said dangerous things.  Here, you take a group of people who\\'ve done  something wrong, been fully punished, and you\\'re saying  that they might say something to somebody which would be  dangerous. And you\\'re right; it might be. On the other  hand, your remedy from that is to cut off their speech.  Now, I suspect my law clerks, in the space  of half an hour, would find many cases that put it the  level of generality I\\'ve just put at, say it is hornbook  law that you can\\'t. You can\\'t unless there is at least  a clear and present danger, you know, homes. There are  lots of qualifications.  So why don\\'t you tell me when my law clerks  are going to look all these up -- and I think I have a  few in mind -- what case we should look up to be sure we  get the opposite, which is what you\\'re arguing, I think.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>The most fundamental\\n\\n \\n  right is taken away from ex -- fundamentals by some - some States prohibit ex-felons from voting.

So why wouldn\\'t the\\n\\n same be appropriate here?</p><p> I take it, Mr. Goldberg,\\n\\n that a part of what the State is saying here is that it\\n\\n doesn\\'t have the capacity to do that. It doesn\\'t have\\n\\n the capacity to check message-by-message or\\n\\n click-by-click what a person is doing. And in the\\n\\n absence of that, that some kind of prophylactic remedy\\n\\n is needed.\\n\\n And that\\'s not unheard of in First Amendment\\n\\n law.

It -- it takes the nytimes.com out of  the statute, but it doesn\\'t take the sites that people  use today, as I suggested -- whether it\\'s Twitter or  whether it\\'s Facebook -- which have become incredibly  important parts of our political culture, of our  religious culture.  If you ask, there are surveys that say how  many Americans have communicated their faith on social  networking sites in the -- in the past week, and it  turns out that one in five. That\\'s about 50 million  Americans use this for religious community purposes.  So whether it\\'s political community, whether  it\\'s religious community, I mean, these sites have  become embedded in our culture as ways to communicate  and ways to exercise our constitutional rights, haven\\'t  they?</p><p> It just seems to exempt the  stuff that\\'s most easily used to -- to do exactly the  things that this statute is meant to prevent.</p><p> Mr. -- Mr. Montgomery, can I\\n\\n ask you a question that has to do with the law\\'s\\n\\n exemptions? Because it just confused me when I was\\n\\n reading it. It seems that some -- some of what\\'s\\n\\n exempted by the law seems, I have to say, some of the\\n\\n most dangerous stuff. So you exempt any website that\\n\\n provides only a chat room or only photo sharing. So why\\n\\n is that? Because if I would have said, like, where the\\n\\n \\n36  most dangerous activity takes place, it\\'s in chat rooms  and via photo sharing.</p><p> Not only the President. I  mean, we\\'re sort of aware of it because the President  now uses Twitter. But in fact, everybody uses Twitter.  All 50 governors, all 100 senators, every member of the  House has a Twitter account. So this has become a  crucial -- crucially important channel of political  communication. And a person couldn\\'t go onto those  sites and find out what these members of our government  are thinking or saying or doing; is that right?</p><p> Social networking, it  includes Facebook, obviously; it includes LinkedIn; it  includes Twitter; is that right?</p><p> So -- so a -- so a person in  this situation, for example, cannot go onto the  President\\'s Twitter account to find out what the  President is saying today?</p><p> Mr. Montgomery, I agree with  you. That\\'s your closest case. It\\'s the one that I  asked Mr. Goldberg about, because it\\'s the only case  that I know of where we\\'ve permitted a prophylactic rule  where we\\'ve said not all conduct will have these  dangerous effects, but we don\\'t exactly know how to  separate out the dangerous -- dangerous speech from the  not-dangerous speech, so we\\'re going to have a  prophylactic rule. That is like one out of a zillion  First Amendment cases that we\\'ve decided in our history.\\n \\n41  And as Justice Kennedy says, there are many reasons to  think it\\'s distinguishable from this one.</p><p> But all this implying of\\n\\n punctuation marks, I mean, if you just read this, it\\'s\\n\\n contain information such as a bunch of things, which\\n\\n none of which are necessary, but these are good examples\\n\\n of things that characterize allowing users to create web\\n\\n pages or personal profiles that contain information.\\n\\n That\\'s your requirement.</p><p> And then another implied\\n \\n\\n semicolon.\\n\\n50</p><p> And then another implied  semicolon.</p><p> Well, then you need an  implied colon and an implied semicolon.</p><p> It -- it allows users to  create web pages or personal profiles that contain  information such as links to other personal web pages.  So you\\'re reading the \"such as\" as a  requirement, but \"such as\" is not a requirement. \"Such  as\" is just like here\\'s an example, but you don\\'t  necessarily need this.</p><p> Right. So (B)(iii).</p><p> Where is that in the  statute? Because I don\\'t read the statute to impose  that as a requirement. So tell me where you find that.</p><p> This is the way people\\n\\n structure their civic community life.</p><p> How many people under 30 do\\n\\n you think don\\'t use these sites to get all their\\n\\n information? Under 35? I mean, they\\'re --\\n\\n increasingly, this is the way people get everything\\n\\n that -- all information.</p><p> When you just said to  Justice Ginsburg, well, maybe that would be  unconstitutional if they included these things that are  instead exempted, so you mean that there\\'s a  constitutional right to use Snapchat, but not to use  Twitter?</p><p> Well, I would have -- I  would have thought that Snapchat is -- is -- maybe I  have it wrong. I\\'m not any expert on this. But isn\\'t  Snapchat photo sharing?</p><p> Yeah. So that falls under  the exemption; right? So you can use Snapchat, but you  can\\'t use Twitter?</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>Please go ahead.

But we could -- if you want to be very  strict about what's before us, we could simply say the  Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the statute is wrong  and remand for further proceedings to the Ninth Circuit.\\n \\n46</p><p> Assuming -- assuming that\\n\\n there is a constitutional limit of the type that's been\\n\\n discussed, is that -- do you think that can be addressed\\n\\n in a class action, or is it something that can be\\n\\n addressed only in individual habeas cases?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>It says \"only if.\" Only if\\n\\n you go to the witness program.</p><p> Right. That\\'s -- that\\'s -  right there you said, of course,  years, dot, dot,  dot, dot. As soon as you utter words like that, you are  outside. And it\\'s in conceding, I take it, that where  it says, the AG may release an alien described in  paragraph , these are the criminal ones.</p><p> May. May.</p><p> May.</p><p> C is the criminals. C is  the criminals, isn\\'t it?</p><p> Okay. I agree. Criminal  is a different matter. I\\'m just talking about -- go  ahead. Go ahead.</p><p> What do you do with \"only\\n\\n if\"?</p><p> You\\'ve got most -- most -\\n\\n Zadvydas turned on the \"may,\" you see. It gave him\\n\\n permission. And as -- as he just pointed out, there\\'s\\n\\n may, may, may, may, may, but then in the criminal side,\\n\\n see, on the criminal side -- I\\'m not talking about\\n\\n people on the border. I -- you -- pretty strong\\n\\n argument, people on the border -- but there it says,\\n\\n \"The Attorney General may release an alien described in\\n\\n paragraph ()\" -- those are the criminals coming out -\\n\\n \"only if\" -- and then it\\'s the Witness Protection\\n\\n Program.\\n\\n So he says, how do you get around that one?</p><p> What happens -- what\\n\\n happens if they present themselves at the border -</p><p> -- or the desert, and they\\n\\n say, I have a right to live in the United States?\\n \\n41  You\\'ve made a mistake in respect to me. What happens to  that person?</p><p> But, of course, I say I  don\\'t want to leave. I\\'m a right -- I have a right to  live here.</p><p> What happens if you\\'re at  the border and you come up and you -</p><p> And what\\'s the language of  the statute that you believe the government points to,  to say you never get a bond hearing?</p><p> Yeah.\\n \\n31</p><p> So -- so we are in the\\n\\n first part.\\n\\n Now, on that first part, it\\'s a pretty odd\\n\\n statute that can say you don\\'t have -- you -- we can\\n \\n keep you for two years, you know, or three, or four.\\n\\n30\\n\\n You\\'ve just been out of jail, hey, your term is over.\\n\\n Your punishment\\'s over, but you\\'ve got four more years\\n\\n here of punishment while we try to get to stage two,\\n\\n which is called the removal order. That\\'s what\\'s\\n\\n bothering me.\\n\\n It is bothering me that, as a lawyer, it\\n\\n produces an odd statute. As a person who tries to\\n\\n interpret the Constitution, I\\'d say what happened to the\\n\\n notion that you do let people out on bail when, in fact,\\n\\n they\\'re not a flight risk. And how can they be punished\\n\\n for four more years? Maybe it\\'s the Constitution.\\n\\n Maybe there is a way around that \"only if\" language.\\n\\n But the concern is the same.\\n\\n So now -- now you have all my questions out\\n\\n there, and I -- I know they\\'re -- they\\'re -- do what you\\n\\n can.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> I might be wrong. I\\'m\\n\\n often wrong in what I think I said. All right?\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Let\\'s look at that statute.\\n\\n As you would like to interpret it, during that first\\n\\n period -- remember, the second period I\\'m with you, the\\n\\n 90 days. The third period settled. That\\'s Zadvydas.\\n\\n You got to let him go after six months. So we are\\n\\n talking about the first period.\\n\\n If there\\'s a -- I think -- take my word for\\n\\n it. I might be wrong. I go back and did it. I wrote\\n\\n the Zadvydas thing. I think it said six months.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> This is 1226(). It\\'s  (c)().</p><p> The words that are\\n \\n  strongest for you, in my opinion, are those words, \"only  if.\"</p><p> \"Only if.\"</p><p> Only if the witness  program. Now, you\\'re saying, well, it\\'s not really only  if. There are exceptional circumstances where he has  been there for  years and we haven\\'t started the  removal proceeding, or let\\'s say he has an emergency  operation, has to be in the hospital, we all can  exercise our wonderful legal imaginations and think of  weird instances where it\\'s going to prove that \"only if\"  isn\\'t literally \"only if\" witness.</p><p> No. I knew that. I know  that.</p><p> But my point was, and you\\n\\n did it accidentally but on purpose. You said, well, \\n\\n years would be different, and -- and -</p><p> Why? Why do it as a\\n\\n matter -- why not just say -</p><p> Okay. Now, why not do that\\n\\n rather than appeal to the Constitution? That may be a\\n\\n picky point, but -- but one -</p><p> Yes.</p><p> I have a couple of\\n\\n questions I\\'d like to ask, actually, because it\\'s a\\n\\n complicated statute. And you can correct me. I think\\n\\n you have some extra -</p><p> We\\'re -- we\\'re talking\\n\\n about three categories. The first category is people\\n\\n who show up on the border. That\\'s mostly 1225. I\\'ve\\n\\n looked at that. I don\\'t see any words there that would\\n\\n prevent interpreting the statute from saying, of course,\\n\\n you have a bail hearing after six months, and under\\n\\n whatever standards. I\\'m not going with the Ninth\\n\\n Circuit standards, et cetera. I don\\'t see the words.\\n\\n So put that in your mind, because you\\'re going to tell\\n\\n me the words in a minute.</p><p> But the more important\\n\\n part, I think, is the criminal part. And there I have\\n\\n divided my mind into three -- three stages.\\n\\n Stage one, the person is released from jail,\\n\\n let\\'s say. And the statute says, Attorney General, pick\\n\\n him up. And then there is a period of time where he\\n\\n says, I have a right to stay in the United States, and\\n\\n the AG says you don\\'t. And during that period of time\\n\\n we have the \"only if\" language.\\n\\n And then we go to the period of there is a\\n\\n final removal order, and that\\'s a 90-day order. And\\n\\n there I see no way around the statute. I agree with\\n\\n you. That 90 days, you cannot get out of the statute.\\n \\n I mean, it\\'s definite.\\n\\n\\n\\n Then the removal period ends, and we are in\\n\\n Zadvydas. And unlike you, I don\\'t think Demore\\n\\n overruled Zadvydas. Demore was talking about a brief\\n\\n period of time.\\n\\n So now, let\\'s start with the criminal.</p><p> -- like all -- many type\\n\\n same things in the law, words like \"any\" or \"only if\"\\n\\n are always interpreted in light of unusual\\n\\n circumstances, not being absolute and you get something\\n\\n unusual.</p><p> Is this -- is this -\\n\\n right. I\\'m focusing now right on the people who want to\\n\\n come into the United States. If they\\'re in the desert\\n\\n and they say, I won\\'t go back because I have a right to\\n\\n live here, they do get a bail hearing. So if the whole\\n\\n is taking a long time, they\\'ll at least have a bail\\n\\n hearing.\\n\\n If they\\'re at the border and they\\'re coming\\n\\n in under the same statute, 1225, they say, I\\'m not going\\n\\n back. I have a right to live here. And then there is\\n\\n no hearing?</p><p> Well, how can that -- I\\n\\n don\\'t get that, because what it says is \"may\"\\n\\n throughout, until you get to the word \"shall be detained\\n\\n for a proceeding under Section 1229(a)\"; is that right?</p><p> So I look up\\n\\n55\\n\\n Section 1229(a). And Section 1229(a), which I\\'ve been\\n\\n reading, doesn\\'t say anything about keeping them in\\n\\n detention. So why isn\\'t it the simplest thing in the\\n\\n world once that person\\'s at the border and they say,\\n\\n we\\'re going to detain you for 1229(a). You say, have\\n\\n the 1229(a) tomorrow. And if they don\\'t have it\\n\\n tomorrow, then you say, but I\\'m into the 1229(a); it\\n\\n just hasn\\'t been scheduled yet. And therefore, you get\\n\\n bail after six months?\\n\\n Have you tried that one?</p><p> What did they say?</p><p> So it\\'s the regulations;\\n\\n it\\'s not the statute. So we could say -- I mean, I\\'m\\n\\n just saying -- you\\'re going to agree with this, which is\\n\\n the problem. I need a disagreement.\\n\\n But the -- the -- you could say they do it\\n \\n for the desert. The language doesn\\'t forbid it. It\\n\\n56\\n\\n throws you into 1229(a). It\\'s possible to interpret the\\n\\n statute as saying for purposes of a bail hearing, the\\n\\n 1229(a) starts tomorrow.</p><p> Okay. So we could do that\\n\\n one on the statute if it is correct that you should not\\n\\n hold a person for years in the United States without\\n\\n giving him a chance to get back to his freedom through a\\n\\n bail hearing, if appropriate.\\n\\n Okay. (c). Now, I\\'m still stuck on (c).\\n\\n And the reason, the value of a statutory interpretation\\n\\n is that we\\'re dealing with tens of thousands, hundreds\\n\\n of thousands, or millions of people, possibly. And it\\'s\\n\\n an administrative agency organization, and they need a\\n\\n rule. They need a rule. And if we can interpret the\\n\\n statute, you can give them a rule. And that rule, then,\\n\\n can have lots of discretion in it through bail hearings,\\n\\n et cetera.</p><p> But I haven\\'t heard from\\n\\n you yet what I -- I see no way -- if you want to tell\\n\\n me -- I see no way of getting around the 90 days. That\\n\\n 90 days, it seems to me to be they don\\'t get a hearing\\n\\n around the 90 days. The removal order is there.\\n \\n57</p><p> Good.</p><p> You are -- you are not  worried on a -</p><p> Okay. Then after, we\\'ve  got Zadvydas. And then before -</p><p> -- the 90 days starts, they  say, well, gee, shouldn\\'t we -- shouldn\\'t there be an  exception here so that the period between the time they  are released from their punishment to the time we have  the hearing, if that goes on for  years, you know, you  can\\'t -- the person was supposed to be punished for six  months, not for  years.</p><p> But I want to know, what do  I do with the language?</p><p> And -- and -- and\\n\\n the -- the -- you know, language counts.</p><p> So I -</p><p> Well, I wasn\\'t -- I wasn\\'t\\n\\n thinking of necessarily asylum seeker. I was thinking\\n\\n of a man who goes to a foreign country who is an alien.\\n\\n He has a family in the United States. He comes back,\\n\\n and he says, I want to go home. And the immigration\\n\\n officer says, no, we\\'re going to keep you locked up for\\n\\n five years because there was something wrong with your\\n\\n initial application. He says, no, there wasn\\'t. They\\n\\n say, yes, there was.\\n\\n So I\\'m simply asking, if that human being,\\n\\n who has a family in the United States is, in the view of\\n\\n the government, locked up for five years without any\\n\\n hearing whatsoever, without any opportunity for bail,\\n\\n even though he can get out of it simply by abandoning\\n\\n his family and returning to another country, is that the\\n\\n position of the government as to what this statute\\n\\n means?</p><p> I got your argument.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Who would -</p><p> Clarify two things. One,\\n \\n what are the -- what have the people in that category\\n\\n\\n\\n done that would make them subject to removal; and two,\\n\\n does the government read the bond specification in\\n\\n 1225(a) as discretionary?</p><p> What about 1225(a), that\\n\\n is, aliens who don't fit in either of the categories\\n\\n that you discussed? They are not entrants, and they are\\n\\n not people who have committed qualifying criminal\\n\\n offenses. So they are the 1225(a) people.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>So we're beyond -</p><p> It's odd language, though,  General. I mean, easy enough to say pending a removal  decision, or pending an asylum decision.</p><p> And they didn't say that.  They said for the consideration of an asylum  application. Like, why would you say that, to say  pending an asylum decision?</p><p> What happens if -- what  happens if you can't point to any particular evidence of  government misconduct, but that you're in a situation  where the government just has very, very big backlogs\\n \\n  and everything is taking a long time? So let's say the  average would be that the government wouldn't make a  decision for three years. Could the Court simply say,  well, three years is too long? It doesn't really matter  what kind of evidence you have; three years is too long.</p><p> And not focus on the statute\\n \\n  so much but focus on the constitutional question, and I  think your brief indicates that you think that there are  some constitutional bounds, and so I'd like you to talk  to me about what those constitutional bounds are and -  and when a judge would find them.</p><p> Let's -- let's shift to\\n\\n 1226(c).</p><p> I was going to shift to\\n\\n something else too.</p><p> May I ask, General -- I'm\\n\\n sorry.</p><p> Can I ask about your\\n\\n statutory interpretation on 1225?</p><p> That's the one where it\\n\\n says, the alien shall be detained for, and then one\\n\\n provision says, for further consideration of the\\n\\n application for asylum, and the other says, for a\\n\\n removal proceeding. And you say that -- that that\\n\\n applies only until the relevant proceedings starts.\\n\\n What applies after that, in your view, and\\n\\n where would we find it in the statute?</p><p> No, no, no. I'm sorry -</p><p> Okay. Sorry.</p><p> Well -</p><p> I'm sorry. You do or you\\n\\n don't?</p><p> -- six months, whatever,  something pretty reasonable, but only presumptively if  there is some exceptional circumstance that could be  extended.</p><p> Well, I wasn't -- I wasn't  suggesting a rule that was quite as rigid as that. But  I was suggesting more that the Court, say, pick up some  of your language in your brief and say that the  detention has to serve the purposes for which the  detention is meant. And, presumptively, that is -- pick  a number -- nine months, a year -</p><p> Well, wouldn't it be better\\n\\n to set some guideposts that everybody in the country\\n\\n would know to follow rather than having one suit pop up\\n\\n here and one suit pop up here and another in another\\n\\n place and everybody would be treated differently? That\\n\\n does not seem like a good immigration system.</p><p> I guess I don't quite\\n\\n understand that. Why couldn't a court, whether it's the\\n\\n Ninth Circuit or whether it's this Court in reviewing\\n\\n the Ninth Circuit, say, here are the constitutional\\n\\n guidelines. Here's the way to -- it might -- it might\\n\\n not be a one-size-fits-all. It might be a presumptive\\n\\n limit, but the ability to go beyond that in individual\\n\\n cases, but to set those -- to set those guideposts and\\n\\n then let the individual determinations take place.</p><p> So I wasn't even blaming  you, because I think it was partly the statistics that  were provided and partly what the Court did with them.  It doesn't really matter who was to blame or who wasn't\\n \\n to blame. I was just suggesting that, in fact,\\n\\n\\n\\n Demore -- Demore says that the average is five months;\\n\\n it turns out that the average is more like a little bit\\n\\n over a year.</p><p> But if I could go back,\\n\\n General, to the constitutional point. Because if you\\n\\n put Demore aside, I think we would all look at our\\n\\n precedent and we would say, you can't just lock people\\n\\n up without any finding of dangerousness, without any\\n\\n finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of\\n\\n time, and not run into due process.\\n\\n Now, you have Demore, but Demore was based\\n\\n on the assumption that it was going to be a brief time.\\n\\n It was based on statistics that have now proved to be\\n\\n inaccurate. And the question is, why the Constitution\\n\\n itself -- and you can do it through habeas proceedings\\n\\n or whatever the procedure is -- but why the Constitution\\n\\n itself does not set an outer bound in the way that we've\\n\\n consistently required in, for example, civil commitment\\n\\n cases?</p><p> -- I asked about it.</p><p> The one -- that's --</p><p> We're not making up a\\n \\n statute; we're devising a constitutional limit.\\n\\n63</p><p> I'm a little bit surprised  that you answered the question that way, because it  seems to me that it's quite obvious what the court below  thinks as to the constitutional question where did they  get this from, except as an understanding of what the  Constitution required.</p><p> An administrable\\n\\n constitutional rule, you're saying.</p><p> But suppose the Due Process  Clause requires something a little bit more complex than  a simple date. Suppose that it does require a little  bit of individualized determination as to whether it  should be six months or, in a particular case, a little  bit longer, how does that get decided and what vehicle?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>You do say -- or the Ninth\\n\\n Circuit says there has to be clear and convincing\\n \\n evidence which is higher than the flight risk standard\\n\\n54\\n\\n in a standard bail case.</p><p> But -- and it would also\\n\\n be consistent with the way the Ninth Circuit interpreted\\n\\n the case and the case that\\'s here. We do not have the\\n\\n constitutional issue before us.</p><p> It seems to me that\\'s a\\n\\n very odd interpretation for the statute.</p><p> That\\'s your\\n\\n39\\n\\n interpretation.</p><p> As I under -- as I\\n\\n understood, here the -- the authority ends once the\\n\\n proceeding begins, then you go to 1226.</p><p> Am I right that in -- in\\n \\n bail hearings, it\\'s clear and convincing to show that\\n\\n\\n\\n there is a public danger, but only by a preponderance of\\n\\n the evidence to show flight risk in regular bail\\n\\n hearings?</p><p> I think -- I\\'ll check it.\\n\\n I think not for flight risk.</p><p> In a class action, the\\n\\n Court has to grant or deny relief.

However  you want to define that danger element.  So what's the constitutional entitlement,  just arbitrarily, to keep someone who's neither of those  two things?</p><p> What would be the  constitutional entitlement to keeping those people, if  they're not a flight risk or a -- a risk to the safety  of the country?</p><p> Let me finish my -- your  question.

But at what\\n\\n point does indefinite, albeit with a lengthy, far-off\\n\\n detention date, become unconstitutional?</p><p> And the reasons being  flight risk or danger.</p><p> Except that that bond  hearing, that additional regulation says that the length  of detention is not one of the factors that justifies  reconsideration.</p><p> And so if these are  people who have been here for decades, let's say, don't\\n \\n  you think due process would require some periodic review  to ensure that these people are properly being held?</p><p> No. What makes it\\n\\n unconstitutional in my mind is the unreasonable delay or\\n\\n detention.</p><p> Except that regulations  are saying that you don't consider the length of  detention.

Isn't that factual?</p><p> Contours of the charge in a  particular case is a legal question?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Saying so -- you could have  that every day of the week. People are terminated for  failing tests, and they can come in and complain. Now  at that point, the agency doesn\\'t just say, let\\'s find  some samples, let\\'s do a little sampling here and see  how this is being applied. Let\\'s go invite -- let\\'s  interview a few people at random and see what these  tests are about. Rather, they say we want to talk to  every single employee in the company.  I mean, hey. What\\'s the basis for that on  the basis of that information? Why isn\\'t that an undue\\n \\n\\n burden?</p><p> Why? That\\'s the part I  don\\'t understand. I mean, it\\'s -- there\\'s a woman who  says, I took a test, physical, and I failed it. Period.  And she was terminated. She doesn\\'t say that they are  treating women more harshly. She doesn\\'t say that this  isn\\'t a qualified reason.</p><p> So the law is fairly clear  that when the EEOC asks for a piece of information, they  have to be able to meet that standard.</p><p> Reasonably expected to shed  light on the charge under investigation.</p><p> Where does that come from?</p><p> Well -</p><p> So there has to be enough  information -</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Because?</p><p> -- relevant to the charge  that a person has already brought. I mean, can the EEOC  say, you know, we have an idea there are companies in  the United States that are violating -- and there  could -- probably are -- they are violating various  antidiscrimination things. So what we want to do is  just go to every company in alphabetical order and  interview every employee. Can they do that?</p><p> Well -</p><p> Anything? They can just go  into your house and -- I mean, you know, absent the  Fourth Amendment protection -- go to a business and say,  we want every document you\\'ve ever had. What stops  that?</p><p> That, I -- I -- I\\'m -- I\\'ve\\n\\n always been somewhat uncertain about that. You used the\\n\\n word \"relevance,\" but a fact is relevant if its\\n\\n existence makes the conclusion more likely than if it\\n\\n didn\\'t exist.\\n\\n Now, under that standard, I guess the EEOC\\n\\n or any other agency could require any company, no matter\\n\\n how big or how small, to turn over everything that it\\'s\\n\\n ever had because they might find something in there that\\n\\n would make a discrimination or failure to pay taxes or\\n\\n some other thing more likely than not. So we find that\\n\\n language, and we also find language that say of course\\n\\n they can\\'t authorize a fishing expedition.\\n\\n Well, what\\'s the right standard? What\\n\\n happens, for example, in the subpoena? What happens?\\n\\n What is the standard?</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> Of course it\\'s always\\n\\n relevant when anyone complains about anything to go and\\n\\n see if really there\\'s something suspicious going on by\\n\\n interviewing every single employee, even if there are\\n\\n 500,000 employees. You can\\'t say that an answer might\\n\\n not make it more likely. That\\'s why I was looking at\\n\\n undue burden.\\n\\n And I would think maybe you have to do\\n\\n something before you would decide to spend -- require\\n\\n the company to spend millions of dollars to get every\\n\\n single employee on tape or something. I mean, something\\n\\n more than that. That -- that\\'s what I want to know.\\n\\n How does -- what about that?</p><p> I think she said Morton\\n\\n Salt and --</p><p> So -- so do you see the\\n\\n difference?</p><p> You, unfortunately for us,\\n\\n because you wrote an excellent brief, only have about\\n\\n  --  minutes or so.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> I don\\'t see how we\\'d do it,\\n\\n frankly. I mean, you know, there are thousands of\\n\\n district courts. They -- they hear these things at\\n\\n length. We don\\'t have the time to do all that. We\\'re\\n\\n looking at a cold record. They have the lawyers in\\n\\n front of them. The lawyers can explain what went on in\\n\\n the agency and they can take their time.</p><p> Fourth Amendment, let\\'s --\\n\\n let\\'s take -- I mean, there\\'s some places don\\'t --\\n\\n Fourth Amendment. And, therefore, the Court has to\\n\\n review it.</p><p> All right. So in other\\n\\n words, in your view, the law is that the -- an agency,\\n\\n when somebody complains about anything, can go and ask\\n\\n if that\\'s anywhere in the agency -- anywhere in the\\n\\n company and ask every single employee and require them\\n\\n to spend millions of dollars because, after all, it is\\n\\n relevant. Is that the -- your --</p><p> The other --</p><p> Oh, okay. Is the answer\\n\\n just, well, that\\'s constitutional; therefore, it doesn\\'t\\n\\n count, or whatever?</p><p> So isn\\'t that -- what about\\n\\n the question was asked?</p><p> Yeah. And I -- it doesn\\'t\\n\\n have to be constitutional, I -- I would think. Let\\'s --\\n\\n regardless, I think that\\'s something of a red herring.\\n\\n I don\\'t think an agency, even if it\\'s constitutional,\\n\\n can impose undue burdens. I can\\'t imagine law to the\\n\\n contrary.</p><p> It was -- I\\'m left at the\\n\\n moment -- I\\'ll go back and read it. I just don\\'t know.\\n\\n It\\'s simply when I read this, it struck me as I haven\\'t\\n\\n seen something like this where all that happened was\\n\\n somebody come -- came in in one place and says, I took a\\n\\n test and failed it, and then they start to interview\\n\\n everybody in the whole company. I mean, that --\\n\\n hundreds, thousands. I mean, something struck me as odd\\n\\n about that.\\n\\n So when the district judge then said this is\\n\\n an undue burden or they can\\'t do it, they have to have\\n\\n more than this, I was reluctant to say this is an abuse\\n\\n of discretion, even though he thinks, you know, it\\'s the\\n\\n right thing to do. I mean, that\\'s what judges are there\\n\\n for in the district courts.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>That may be so, but how  do you answer Judge Watford's simple point, that if  you're dealing with a test and in -- both men and women  have failed it, when you want to ask the test-taker what  happened after you -- you failed the test. Were you  kept on the job? And the same question to -- to -- put  that question to men and women. If it turns out that  the men who failed the test are sometimes kept on, but  all the women who failed the test are discharged, that  would certainly support the claim of gender-based  discrimination.</p><p> Why would you remand it  to the district court? Because if it went back to the  Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit could very well say,  we -- we decided a question of law, the scope of what's  relevant. We had a footnote that says we -- we applied  de -- de novo review. That's our -- that's our  precedent.  But nothing in the rest of the opinion seems  to turn on that. It seems that the Ninth Circuit has  made a ruling of law. If you remand it to the Ninth  Circuit, they might -- I expect they would say, we made  a ruling of law. And whether it's abuse of discretion  is the same result because the district court made an  error of law.</p><p> So -- so there's no way  that the -- that the EEOC could contact these people and  ask the question that Judge Watford posed.  So you flunked the test, what happened to  you after?</p><p> Except number one -</p><p> Pierce you -</p><p> I don't -- I don't follow  that. I still -- going back to what Judge Watford said,  he said we don't know why these people were terminated.  Just the information given was maybe they were\\n \\n\\n terminated for a reason having nothing to do with\\n\\n43\\n\\n flunking the test.\\n\\n But what the Ninth Circuit said is -- is --\\n\\n must be responded to is, were the men and women who\\n\\n flunk the test treated the same. And we can't know that\\n\\n without talking to the people, finding out whether they\\n\\n were discharged because of the test or for some other\\n\\n reason.</p><p> Yes, but adverse --\\n\\n adverse employment action can cover a wide range. It\\n\\n doesn't necessarily mean discharge.</p><p> But they would say, if  it's a question of law, if the district court got the  law wrong, that is ipso facto an abuse of discretion  because he has no discretion to misapply the law.</p><p> But why -- why was the  way with a fact sensitive, fleeting facts, multifarious  facts, according to Judge Watford, the pivotal issue is  a legal one; that is, what does relevance mean within  the context of the EEOC's investigatory authority? He  treated that as a question of law. What -- what is the  scope of relevance?</p><p> Pierce you mentioned.  Rule  is another. A district -- a proceeding is going  on in the district court. The district court judge is  intimately familiar with -- with the case.  But a subpoena enforcement is different. It  comes to the district court cold. He knows nothing  about the case. He's not, as he -- in Pierce and in  Rule , thoroughly familiar with the parties and the  controversy. It just -- it's an application to enforce  a subpoena.</p><p> Could you explain to us  your view of how -- how this information, the names of  the test-takers, would shed -- shed light on the -- the  charge?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Could you say a little bit,  Ms. Kovner, about how it is that you\\'re persuaded that  this Court did make a legal determination that was  affecting its judgment, as opposed to maybe using some  careless words, but was really making a relevancy  determination?</p><p> But, Ms. Kovner, here the  question whether to enforce the subpoena is the whole  ball of wax, right? This is an action to enforce the  subpoena. So that question is the end-all and be-all of  the case.  Are there any other contexts in which we use\\n \\n  an abuse of discretion standard for not a subsidiary or  an ancillary finding or, you know, a partial finding,  but for the finding that decides the case?</p><p> But, Mr. Kinnaird, do you\\n\\n think that your whole argument might be taking the words\\n\\n \"abuse of discretion\" a bit too literally? In other\\n\\n words, your idea is that you can never use that term\\n\\n unless there is some discretion, some real choice.</p><p> And, you know, it might be\\n\\n that sometimes we use that term when that\\'s not really\\n\\n true, but what we just mean to say is that a certain\\n\\n amount of deference should be given because the --\\n\\n because we\\'re at the right institution to make a -- to\\n\\n make a particular kind of judgment.\\n\\n \\n39</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>I'll -- I'll look up the\\n\\n cases, but in an evidentiary case, civil case or a\\n\\n criminal case, the question of relevance, I suppose at\\n\\n the end of the day, relevance is a legal matter. But\\n\\n don't we give substantial deference to the trial court\\n\\n in order to administer the trial in an orderly way? And\\n\\n so don't we give substantial deference to their\\n\\n relevance ruling? And how is that applicable here or\\n\\n inapplicable?</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>It doesn't under 401.  Under 401, it resides both in the district court and  in -- on the -- in the court of appeals as an  abuse-of-discretion standard of review.</p><p> I'm a little -</p><p> And -- and it's only the  court of appeals, then, who has to review it as a matter  of law?

There are essentially two\\n\\n rulings by the district court, one on the pedigree\\n\\n information sought -- the name, address, Social Security\\n\\n number, et cetera, of the people who had taken the\\n\\n strength test at issue -- and a second part, a\\n\\n disclosure of the reasons for the termination of the\\n\\n employees who had failed the test.\\n\\n As I read the record below, the district\\n\\n court did not give a reason for denying the second\\n\\n request. And the court of appeals basically said, we\\n\\n can't under any standard of review credit a non-reason\\n\\n for denying something, so we reverse the district court\\n\\n on that.\\n\\n Are you challenging that particular ruling,\\n\\n that reversal of that part of the request?</p><p> So are you reversing\\n\\n that? Are you -- are you appealing that part of the\\n\\n \\n\\n remand?</p><p> So --</p><p> All right. So the only\\n\\n thing that's at issue here is the district court's\\n\\n failure to order the release of the pedigree, what I'm\\n\\n calling the pedigree information.</p><p> On the second question.</p><p> And -- and tell me where\\n\\n you're getting that from. I mean your standard. Okay?</p><p> Could you please tell\\n\\n me -- walk me through exactly what you think, the\\n\\n government thinks, is what the court, district court is\\n\\n doing when it makes a decision to enforce a subpoena?\\n\\n What are the legal steps? What are the factual steps?\\n\\n I'm not quite sure. And -- and then embodied in that is\\n\\n your -- Petitioner says there's an undue burden part of\\n\\n this test as well.

My question was where do you get the undue  burden? But you can answer on rebuttal.</p><p> And so -</p><p> So why isn't the reason  for termination relevant to the charge?

I'd like to hear what you have to say.  I mean, for the purposes of this question,  I'm assuming all the text, which sounds to me, if a  person came from Mars, that's what he would expect a  legal argument to be like.  The -- the number's all over had the place,  and I will also assume that for every chef salad there  is a countervailing strawberry shortcake; all right?  So -- so everything balances out. Assume.  Now, it seems to me that this exception here  is saying this. We have the Secretary of the Treasury.  He has five assistants. Each is a presidential  appointee. One day, secretary -- Assistant Secretary of  the Treasury number two dies, and now the President can  fill that role with any one of three people on an acting  basis: His first assistant, some other assistant  secretary or deputy in the treasury department, or a\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c GS-.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n32\\n\\n Have I got it right so far?</p><p> I'm using examples. All\\n\\n right.\\n\\n Now, what this statute as you read it would\\n\\n seem to say, if you appoint whichever one you choose,\\n\\n put any one of those three people in, go ahead, do it.\\n\\n Now, if you nominate those, one of those three to a\\n\\n presidential position roughly, they are out. All of\\n\\n them are out. Oh, wait. There's one exception. The\\n\\n first assistant is not out if he served for 90 days as\\n\\n first assistant.\\n\\n Have I got the statute right?</p><p> Okay. I would just wonder,\\n\\n were I from Mars, what's the point of such a statute?\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Why is it you're perfectly\\n\\n willing to have stay there and do the acting job the\\n\\n first assistant, if he served 90 days before, but you're\\n\\n not willing to have served the acting job this guy who\\n\\n was a GS- in the same department, or the person who\\n\\n was an assistant secretary of the Treasury, number two.\\n\\n Why? I can't think of an answer given your\\n\\n \\n interpretation.\\n\\n33\\n\\n I can think of an answer given their\\n\\n interpretation. I say what they were worried about on\\n\\n their interpretation were our friends number two and\\n\\n number three, the GS- and the Assistant Secretary\\n\\n number two. They can continue to serve, on their\\n\\n interpretation.\\n\\n Hey, why did they do this? The name of that\\n\\n explanation is called Bill Lann Lee. Because that was\\n\\n the problem that gave rise to the statute, and on their\\n\\n interpretation they passed some words that solved that\\n\\n problem. So there we are.\\n\\n I get an explanation for his, assuming that\\n\\n you like purposes more than you like numbers. I get an\\n\\n explanation on his, and I don't get an explanation on\\n\\n yours. So that's what I would like you to respond to.</p><p> You -- you have been -- and  I understand -- you've been concerned about instances in  which there is controversy over appointment. But there  are thousands of jobs in the government where they have  to run departments where there's no controversy, you  know.  And people leave, or they die, or something  happens; there's a vacancy. And the main institutional  imperative is keep the job being done. Keep the office  working. So an obvious person is to say Mr. First  Assistant, you carry on. Okay? And maybe you bring in  somebody from next door. And maybe you look for a GS-  in the department. You know, the guy next door has a  presidential appointment. So you put him in the job.  That's all. No problem.  And why all of a sudden Congress would, in  these thousands of instances where there's no problem,\\n \\n41  or hundreds anyway, Congress would say, if you decide to  appoint him permanently, you have to take him  immediately out of the acting position, and there's more  disruption in the department. Why would anyone want to  do that?  Now, I could see they might want to do it  with the first assistant where it's a runaround, and  they have an idea that it's a runaround when he hasn't  served as first assistant for more than 90 days. Then  you might say, well, why him? Maybe they were just  trying to get this controversial guy in.  In other words, as -- as an administrator in  noncontroversial matters, I can understand their  interpretation more easily.

So if you didn\\'t have those defenses, as\\n\\n you look down the list of these officials, what kinds of\\n\\n actions are you most worried about being unsettled?</p><p> Well, why do you -- why and\\n\\n how do you think that that change was made, then?\\n\\n Because the change clearly was made.

So the basic conflict seems to me to be the  same in both cases, which is that the second clause says  not so fast, not with respect to those people.</p><p> The way you described that,\\n\\n you sound a bit skeptical of those defenses.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> It\\'s not just -- it\\'s not\\n\\n \\n40  just a matter of my preferences versus the government\\'s  preferences. Now the President\\'s preference is illegal.  It\\'s off the board. Congress has said he can\\'t do it.  Who wouldn\\'t say that in that circumstance?</p><p> General Gershengorn, can I\\n \\n ask: As you read this statute, suppose you just took\\n\\n\\n\\n out these words \"notwithstanding Section\" -- \"Subsection\\n\\n (a)().\" What would then the effect of the statute be?</p><p> But just focusing on text\\n\\n for a minute.</p><p> If that\\'s true, if the\\n\\n entire textual argument really does rest on the\\n\\n \"notwithstanding Subsection (a)()\" -- I mean, typically\\n\\n when you have a \"notwithstanding\" clause, it means, you\\n\\n know, take away Subsection (a)(), not, you know, close\\n\\n your eyes to Subsection (a)(). But it doesn\\'t do\\n\\n anything more than that.\\n\\n So why do you think it should be taken to do\\n\\n something more than that in this case?</p><p> But can I give you a hypo?</p><p> So the hypo is, I\\'m at a  restaurant, and I -- I\\'m talking to my waiter, and I  place three orders. I say, number , I\\'ll have the  house salad. Number two, I\\'ll have the steak. Number  three, I\\'ll have the fruit cup. And then I tell the  waiter, notwithstanding order number three, I can\\'t eat  anything with strawberries.  So on your theory, the waiter could bring me  a house salad with strawberries in it, and that seems to  me a quite odd interpretation of what\\'s a pretty clear  instruction: No strawberries.</p><p> So I -- I take it, you know,  you have some arguments, some strong arguments on -- on  history and on practice, but, you know, again, I\\'m just  sort of -- isn\\'t that just a peculiar way to understand\\n \\n the, you know, notwithstanding order number three, no\\n\\n\\n\\n strawberries?</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>I -- I agree that \"person\"  and \"section\" are very strong arguments for you.  Suppose what the statute said is \"notwithstanding (a)()  and (a)()\"? And what -- what would then be your  argument with respect to whether or not it affected  (a)()?</p><p> Does that 100 include or  exclude military officers? Do you know?</p><p> I\\'m sorry. I think it  should be noted that, you know, it\\'s one thing to  consult legislative history to understand the -- the  whole context in which the -- the Congress was acting,  but it\\'s quite another thing to rely on an isolated  statement and later contradicted by -- by another  Senator, and even for those who at times find  legislative history helpful, I think this is where it\\'s  at its weakest and most unpersuasive.</p><p> What would be the  consequences if we affirm? Your brief didn\\'t list a  great parade of horribles. It seems to me that our\\n \\n system is quite capable of accommodating the\\n\\n\\n\\n Respondent\\'s argument. And on that point, eight judges\\n\\n have looked at this, and every one of them has come to\\n\\n the conclusion that the Respondent\\'s reached.</p>', 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': '<p>So what about (c)()?\\n\\n Isn\\'t, under your reading, it -- it will never be in\\n\\n effect?\\n\\n \\n30</p><p> Telling us -- so that --\\n\\n you can bring those cases, too, or for other people to\\n\\n bring them? They\\'re in a real catch- situation.</p><p> So you say that you can\\n\\n bring those cases, too?</p><p> The Senate is taking a\\n\\n long time to confirm, even when they\\'re not objecting.</p><p> It hasn\\'t happened\\n\\n \\n because no one\\'s read it the way you have and\\n\\n44\\n\\n invalidated that person\\'s actions so far.</p><p> And defeating the\\n\\n efficient running of the department at the same time,\\n\\n because if the person has been running the department,\\n\\n now you\\'re going to put it through a second dislocation\\n\\n of having that person removed and somebody else step in.</p><p> So why aren\\'t (a)() and  (a)() functioning separately from (a)()? If -- if  (c)() can function separately, and that was the thought  of the drafters, why don\\'t we carry it to its logical  conclusion?

In other words, even -\\n\\n52\\n\\n but even if it was, once it's in your treasury they\\n\\n can't get it back because of sovereign immunity.</p><p> I guess what I said  is that by its -- its -- as I understand the background  at least, the act was not addressed to the specific  situation. It was addressed to a different situation,  and yet the court below has interpreted it far more  broadly, not narrowly but broadly, to cover a -- a very  different situation.</p><p> Well, thanks for\\n\\n agreeing with me. I don't think that's what I said.</p><p> Was there any -- you  know, I -- one source of the difficulty we're having, it\\n \\n seems to me, is that the Exoneration Act was addressed\\n\\n49\\n\\n to some -- a situation very different than what we have\\n\\n here. It was addressed to, you know, someone wrongfully\\n\\n imprisoned for  years and the State felt some\\n\\n obligation to remedy that at least in a symbolic way.\\n\\n But in order to qualify for that you do need to show all\\n\\n these other things.\\n\\n And -- I mean, is it completely settled? I\\n\\n guess we have the decision from the Colorado supreme\\n\\n court that that same act applies, and this strikes me as\\n\\n a very different situation.</p><p> Well, that's -- I  mean, what are you going to do? You can't -- you can't  give them back whatever time they've spent in jail. You  just can't do it, but you can give them the money back.</p><p> Private property\\n\\n shall not be taken without just compensation. Don't ask\\n\\n for any procedure or process. Just give me just\\n\\n compensation.</p><p> Why should -- why\\n\\n isn't it a violation of the takings clause?</p><p> Really? Are fines  in Colorado unredeemable once you -- once you put them  in the treasury?</p><p> You say your line  doesn't depend. Does that mean you could apply this  rule to fines?</p><p> Does your -- does\\n\\n your analysis -- why doesn't it apply to criminal fines?\\n\\n In other words, the fine for whatever the\\n\\n offense is, you know, $,000. In other words, it's not\\n \\n43  money that they paid fees along with the process. It's  the end of the process. You're convicted, you pay a  $,000 fine. Why don't -- when the conviction is  overturned, why don't you say, well, you know, this is  our money now, it's in the State treasury, you can't get  it back because of sovereign immunity?</p><p> But that's a\\n\\n question, it seems to me, of -- you keep talking about\\n\\n compensation. The issue is restitution. And under\\n\\n normal equitable principles of restitution, it, in fact,\\n\\n still is the property of the person from whom the money\\n\\n has been taken away. And I wonder if your -- your\\n\\n analysis has to be adjusted when you appreciate that\\n\\n it's not compensation. It's not sort of the normal\\n\\n State, give us some money. Under equitable principles,\\n\\n it's State, give me my money back.</p><p> So if you said\\n\\n instead of the $128 for this, the $30 for -- if you said\\n\\n everybody who is convicted owes the State $,000 and\\n\\n you don't -- you don't get it back if you're later -- if\\n\\n the conviction is later overturned.</p><p> So -- so do you have\\n\\n any obligation to return the money at all, pursuant to\\n\\n any procedures? Could you just say once -- once you pay\\n\\n the money, we have no procedure for you to get it back.\\n\\n In fact, we won't give it back to you ever. It's our\\n\\n money, we don't have to give it back.</p><p> Thank you,\\n\\n Mr. Banner.\\n\\n General Yarger.\\n\\n ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK YARGER\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</p><p> Well, so that's a\\n\\n different analysis than the Mathews analysis, though.</p><p> Including the docket</p><p> Well, that's not\\n\\n true for some of the payments. You know, there's a $30\\n\\n docket fee. In other words, that's not something that\\n\\n depends upon whether the conviction is valid or not in\\n\\n the normal case.</p><p> I was just -- I -- I\\n\\n understood you in responding to Justice Alito to say\\n\\n that the State had to give the money back because they'd\\n\\n acquired it as a result of a flawed prosecution. Is\\n\\n that right?</p><p> We'll hear argument  first this morning in Case -1256, Nelson v. Colorado.  Mr. Banner.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BANNER  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>Oh, okay. So the argument\\n\\n is tradition could do it if there were such a thing.</p><p> But we have to look at the\\n\\n tradition.</p><p> Well, then your -- I think  your argument has moved from the simple one I started  out with, which is that you're absolutely entitled to be  made whole, to the argument that they have to provide -  that we look to tradition and we have -- we have to see  what sort of tradition is adequate.  So what would be an adequate procedure here?</p><p> Well, is that true? I mean,\\n\\n I still don't understand the difference between the\\n\\n simple argument that you're required to be made whole\\n\\n and the argument that a court could deny restitution\\n\\n based on equitable considerations as this court has\\n\\n said.\\n\\n So which is your argument? You\\n \\n automatically get it back; that's the end of it. You\\n\\n\\n\\n don't -- no procedure is necessary -</p><p> So what is that process\\n \\n after the conviction is reversed?</p><p> Well, if tradition -- I\\n\\n mean, if tradition like that can defeat the argument for\\n\\n compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison, then\\n\\n can tradition defeat the argument that you make with\\n\\n respect to the fees and the restitution?</p><p> Okay. Now, if that is the\\n \\n  argument, there are two complications that I see in your  briefing. One is that you concede that they could be  denied restitution for equitable reasons. Let's just  take that.  Where -- where else in the law of due  process would something like that come up?</p><p> I thought your argument\\n\\n was -- was this, but what you're saying now and a lot of\\n\\n your brief is much more complicated, but the simple\\n\\n argument I thought was this:\\n\\n This was your client's money. It's a\\n\\n certain amount of dollars. Okay. It was taken away\\n\\n from them as a result of a trial that was flawed and\\n\\n therefore they were deprived of that property without\\n\\n due process of law. I thought that was the argument.\\n\\n Am I right or not?</p><p> The other complication that\\n\\n I see in this make-whole argument, in other words, the\\n\\n State took things away from you, they took property away\\n\\n from you, and when the conviction is reversed, they have\\n\\n to restore you to the position you were in before the\\n\\n prosecution. Is this, the -- the restitution and all of\\n\\n these fees are small in comparison with the main thing\\n\\n that was taken away, and that was -- that was liberty.\\n\\n So if your argument is correct, why\\n\\n shouldn't this -- what -- did -- didn't the State -- the\\n\\n State took away your clients' liberty without due\\n\\n process of law, so would they be automatically entitled\\n\\n to be made whole in that respect?</p><p> Why not?</p><p> -- or that you could be\\n\\n denied receiving the money back for equitable reasons?</p><p> But your argument is that  if -- let's say there's a very substantial judgment of  restitution and the money is paid to the victims. Let's  say they're victims like the ones in this case, so  it's -- it's therapy -</p><p> Well, what if the State says\\n\\n that you -- that the defendant has the obligation to\\n\\n move for a stay of the judgment of restitution when the\\n\\n defendant takes an appeal, and if the defendant doesn't\\n\\n do that, then the money is not refunded?</p><p> -- for abuse.  And then even after the judgment has become  final, if there is -- if -- if the defendant is given  relief on collateral review, the State would have to -  would have to compensate the defendant for all the money  that was paid to the victims. That's your argument?</p><p> Why does it -- why does it\\n \\n matter who owns this money at this time under Colorado\\n\\n46\\n\\n law? This was the defendants' money and it was taken\\n\\n away from them. So if -- at -- you say that at some\\n\\n point it ceased to be their money and it became the\\n\\n state's money. But then you have to show that it was\\n\\n taken away pursuant to due process, and consistent with\\n\\n due process.</p><p> Well, how can the\\n\\n conviction -- how -- how can the conviction have been\\n\\n reversed if -- if they were convicted consistent with\\n\\n due process?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Yeah, yeah.</p><p> That is what I am afraid\\n\\n of. So -</p><p> Common.</p><p> -- let\\'s go over your case\\n\\n that you like, the Bank of Washington v. United States,\\n\\n 1832. And it says \"the law.\" What law? The common -</p><p> I mean -</p><p> Well, wait, as long as you\\n\\n have a minute.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Okay.</p><p> I\\'m looking for something  here in the opinion that will -- that I could just say,  \"Okay. See? They concede that it is this man\\'s  property. They concede it.\" But I haven\\'t found that  sentence. That\\'s my -</p><p> They use the word \"return\"?  I\\'m looking for something here -- but, I mean, you see  what\\'s -</p><p> Because that could be\\n\\n consistent with the money\\'s their property, but they\\n\\n have an obligation to give it back.</p><p> All right. So what do we\\n\\n do about that?</p><p> It doesn\\'t say the opposite\\n\\n either.</p><p> Now -- now, that, I stop  right there and then I\\'m asking -- I don\\'t know what  your -- I have to ask him, and that\\'s why his brief has  several different arguments, because it\\'s hard to figure  out, but there\\'s -- okay.  Do you want to say anything in response to  this question?  (Laughter.)</p><p> Maybe those cases were\\n\\n wrong. I don\\'t -- I don\\'t know. I have to go read them\\n \\n45  and figure it out. But -- but it can\\'t be that there\\'s  no point to an appeal. Because we\\'re not going to give  you back the fine.</p><p> Maybe they were right in\\n\\n 1832 and then they went off on a wrong track.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> You have a corporate\\n\\n criminal defendant, you can\\'t put him in jail, and -\\n\\n and so what they do is they fine the corporation\\n\\n $ million. And then the State says, by the way, why\\n\\n appeal? If you win, we\\'re not going to give you the\\n\\n money back as the Chief Justice said. We\\'ll assert\\n\\n sovereign immunity.\\n\\n Now, there\\'s something wrong with that. I\\'m\\n\\n trying to put my finger on it.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Right. So what happens\\n\\n then? I mean, you -- I grant you have a tough side of\\n\\n this argument. It doesn\\'t seem very fair. But the -\\n\\n the -- the -\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Suppose we go by the -\\n\\n what this Court said in 1832, which seems like\\n\\n historical tradition. Suppose I take that, unless you\\n\\n give me a reason not to, as stating what the law is.\\n \\n That\\'s what it says.\\n\\n39\\n\\n So what\\'s your response to that?</p><p> I\\'m more interested in what\\n\\n does the -- did the Colorado supreme court say, this is\\n\\n his money, but we don\\'t have a remedy? Did it say, this\\n\\n is our money and we don\\'t have to have a remedy? What\\n\\n did it say?</p><p> In 1832. All right.</p><p> This Court was the one -</p><p> This Court used that.</p><p> -- or creates an\\n \\n obligation. It doesn\\'t say \"may.\"\\n\\n37</p><p> It doesn\\'t say \"can.\" It  says the law raises an obligation to the one who\\'s  received the benefit of the erroneous judgment to make  restitution to the other party -</p><p> It says on page  of their  brief, they had three cases, one going back to 1832 of  this Court that says the law is that when you reverse  the judgment in a civil case -- I wouldn\\'t know why it  would apply, too, as well as to criminal -- that you -  the person on the other side gets the money back.  Now, it doesn\\'t say what law. And,  moreover, you heard your brother here say, well, the  Colorado supreme court said that this wasn\\'t a question  here of whose property it was, it was a question of the  remedy. The property belonged to the criminal  defendant.  Now, so, one, what do you say about those  cases? Two, what did the Colorado supreme court say as  a matter of property law?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>That's why Colorado\\n\\n passed the Exoneration Act.</p><p> Was Mr. Banner wrong,  then, when he told us that before the Exoneration Act,  Colorado, like every other State, just gave the money  back?</p><p> What did Colorado do -</p><p> -- with respect to  monetary sanctions before the Exoneration Act?</p><p> The argument is that that\\n\\n Act is an inappropriate procedure; that the procedure\\n\\n set up by the Exoneration Act where they have to prove\\n\\n themselves actually innocent is a procedure that does\\n\\n not comport with due process.</p><p> This is what they, they  made a motion.</p><p> What is the basis of -  of the right? You said the person whose conviction is  overturned has a right to get the money back. Is it a  constitutional right? What kind of right is it?</p><p> Let me ask you this  question: Suppose we have a criminal trial. The jury  comes in with a verdict of guilty. And then the trial  judge said judgment vacated. There was insufficient  evidence to convict. In that case, the defendant would  not owe any fees to the State; right?</p><p> But the judge instead  says there was sufficient evidence; appeal. The court  of appeals then says there was insufficient evidence, so  we vacate the conviction. In that case, all that money  is kept -- can be kept by the State? What's the  difference whether the finding was made by the trial  judge or by an appellate court?</p><p> We're not talking about  compensation. We're talking about getting your money  back.</p><p> And we're talking about\\n\\n hundreds of dollars, not even a thousand in one case.\\n\\n So -</p><p> You would have to engage\\n\\n a lawyer.</p><p> What did Colorado do\\n\\n before the Exoneration Act with respect to returning -</p><p> -- if any -- it seems to\\n\\n me any requirement that you sue to get the money back.</p><p> You'd have to get -- pay\\n\\n a filing fee -</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Well, I think that that\\'s\\n\\n just mistaken, General. They\\'re saying that they have a\\n\\n general State law property right in the money.\\n\\n Now, do you disagree with that? Do you\\n\\n think that this is their money?</p><p> Whose money is it?</p><p> But it\\'s -- it\\'s money\\n\\n that\\'s conditioned on a valid conviction. And when that\\n\\n valid conviction goes away, it seems the most natural,\\n\\n obvious thing in the world to say that the State\\'s right\\n\\n to that money evaporates at exactly the same moment.\\n\\n Why isn\\'t that true?</p><p> I\\'m not talking about due\\n \\n process. I\\'m merely just talking about whose money it\\n\\n\\n\\n is. Under State law, State property law, whose money is\\n\\n it? They say it\\'s their money because there\\'s no longer\\n\\n a valid conviction. You say notwithstanding that the\\n\\n valid conviction has been reversed, it\\'s the State\\'s\\n\\n money. I want to know why.</p><p> Well, why is it the State\\'s\\n\\n money?</p><p> Could you just sort of\\n\\n describe to me in sort of common sensical terms, you\\n\\n know, rather than point me to a sovereign immunity case\\n\\n or something, just in common sensical terms why is this\\n\\n the State\\'s money?</p><p> But in -- if you\\'re looking\\n\\n at procedural due process, I would have thought that\\n\\n your argument is the simple one of: This is property\\n\\n under State law; it\\'s -- it\\'s my property, it\\'s your\\n\\n client\\'s property. And then we apply the Mathews test\\n\\n to determine what kind of procedure is due -</p><p> -- to get that property\\n\\n back. And tradition -</p><p> -- wouldn\\'t be any part of\\n\\n that.</p><p> Well, it -- it seems,\\n\\n Mr. Banner, that you could be approaching this in two\\n\\n ways. I mean, one is you could be claiming a\\n\\n substantive due-process right along the lines that\\n\\n Colorado said you were doing, and then you came back and\\n\\n said no. Now, if you were suggesting that you had a\\n\\n substantive due-process right, then surely tradition\\n\\n would be important.</p><p> What do States generally do\\n \\n  if they\\'ve collected this money, they\\'ve paid it out to  the victim, and then the conviction is overturned? Do  they usually leave the money with the victim and just  take it out of their general treasury, or do States try  to take it back from the victim?</p><p> General, you said a couple  of times that if -- if we were to look at this as this  is not public property once the conviction is vacated,  that instead it once again becomes the criminal  defendant\\'s property, the acquitted defendant\\'s  property, if that were true what kind of procedure would  you have to set up to return the property, do you think?</p><p> General, can I go back to  what -- I\\'m sorry. I interrupted you midstream.</p><p> That\\'s the -- you said  \"that\\'s the question\" as though something big was coming  up.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Okay. So you said to\\n\\n Justice Sotomayor, you said we agree that if this were\\n\\n their money, we would have to refund it in normal ways\\n\\n consistent with procedural due process.</p><p> Okay. So it really all does\\n\\n depend on whether we think it\\'s their money or it\\'s your\\n\\n money.</p><p> So if this were your money\\n\\n on this -- on the simple theory of, there once was a\\n\\n conviction, it once was valid, we collected the money at\\n\\n that time, and that makes it our money going forward\\n\\n forever and ever, no matter what happens to the\\n\\n conviction. If that\\'s your theory, it\\'s not only true,\\n\\n as the Chief Justice said, that you wouldn\\'t have to\\n\\n provide any remedy or any process for getting that money\\n\\n back; right? You could just keep it and say, doesn\\'t -\\n\\n you can prove your innocence, you cannot prove your\\n\\n innocence. Too bad. It\\'s our money. You agree with\\n\\n that. I think you said that to the Chief.</p><p> And it would also be true, I\\n \\n would think, that even if that conviction were\\n\\n42\\n\\n improperly gained, not just in the sense that it was\\n\\n later vacated, but let\\'s say it was the State\\'s fault\\n\\n that that conviction occurred; in other words, let\\'s\\n\\n say, oh, I don\\'t know, there was a Brady violation or\\n\\n something like that. It would still be your money.</p><p> So your complaint is not to\\n\\n the nature of this action and to exactly what you have\\n\\n to prove. You\\'re saying that as soon as the conviction\\n\\n is vacated, the State has to put a check in the mail.</p><p> If that\\'s right, and this is\\n\\n the basic argument, it\\'s our money by virtue of State\\n\\n law, and once the conviction disappears, why doesn\\'t the\\n\\n State have to proactively return the money? In other\\n\\n words, why is it even required for the person to bring\\n\\n any kind of refund action against the State?</p><p> No. I guess I\\'m asking, if\\n \\n your theory is right, why is even that necessary? If\\n\\n\\n\\n your theory is right, it seems -- I mean, you know -\\n\\n you know, you might file a motion because the State\\n\\n hasn\\'t done what it\\'s supposed to do, but it seems as\\n\\n though the obligation on the State\\'s part is immediately\\n\\n to put a check in the mail.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>Well, you don\\'t have to  make that argument to prevail in this case, do you? I  think there\\'s -</p><p> -- some severe equitable  problems with -- with the -- with the hypothetical of\\n \\n the State having paid the -- the victim and the victim\\n\\n\\n\\n having spent the money.</p><p> If we\\'re writing -</p><p> If we\\'re writing this\\n\\n opinion and we begin, \"Tradition is very important\\n\\n here,\" because?</p><p> That\\'s if we\\'re trying to\\n\\n define the substantive right.</p><p> That\\'s -</p><p> Are -- are you saying that  if a State creates a right under State law, it cannot  unduly complicate that right by flawed procedures, under  our procedural due process jurisprudence?</p><p> Getting back to the State  law for a moment.</p><p> It has to be -- it -- it\\n\\n has to be constitutional if Colorado says we don\\'t want\\n\\n to follow the common law. This is not the law here.</p><p> So -- so if it\\'s not\\n\\n constitutional, then -- then what\\'s the -- what\\'s the\\n\\n basis for -- for your case?</p><p> Can we look at the  tradition again? It seems to me for constitutional  reasons, not for State law reasons, that\\'s where I\\'m  somewhat confused.  I mean, who -- who cares about tradition if  the State says X and the tradition is Y, unless there\\'s  a constitutional -</p>', 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>It would seem to me that\\n\\n if the State had an equitable reason, it should prove\\n\\n it, not you.</p><p> Do you think the\\n\\n requirement to start a separate civil action comports\\n\\n with due process?</p><p> I thought -- let's -\\n\\n let's take the act. What parts of the procedure of the\\n\\n act are you saying violate due process?</p><p> I assume you apply the  Mathews framework. Do you agree that the court got it  right, or do you think even under Mathews the court  below got it wrong?</p><p> The dissent here said  something quite simple, which was the only entitlement  to the money was the conviction.</p><p> Make that argument.</p><p> Make that argument.</p><p> If the conviction has  been voided, then what legal right does the State have  to retain the money?</p><p> The Colorado supreme  court, on the other hand, said when you paid the money,  we were entitled to it. So where -- there's a  disconnect there.  If they were entitled to it initially, we're  still back to the operative question of why are they\\n \\n entitled? What is the constitutional right for you to\\n\\n\\n\\n get it back?</p><p> Let's go to the stay.  Could you -- can you honestly say to me that if this  defendant had moved for a stay, that the trial court  would have granted one? In how many cases do you think  of the thousands of convictions that Colorado goes  through would a court order a stay?\\n \\n34</p><p> Why isn't this  comparable to forfeiture?</p><p> What a wonderful  procedural quagmire you're throwing on courts below.  The number of vacated convictions are tiny. The number  of proceedings you want now with stay motions to be  determined by trial courts is hundreds, if not  thousands.

And -- and if you have no  conviction to justify the -- a payment of money because  it's been voided, why is it your money now? Just simply  because you collected it beforehand, even though the  basis for the collection is wrong?</p><p> I think in the briefing,\\n\\n we're pointed to any number of situations in which lower\\n\\n courts did order -- automatically gave -- ordered the\\n\\n money to go back.</p><p> Are you denying that\\n\\n there were courts -- lower courts that routinely ordered\\n\\n the refund of these monies?</p><p> You want every trial  court to decide whether a stay is appropriate.</p><p> How about we borrow from\\n \\n40  double jeopardy? Once the -- once the judgment is void,  you no longer have a basis to that property. It's  theirs. They had -- it was their money to begin with.

Money is property. We\\n\\n all have a right to own our property; correct?</p><p> Should we be\\n\\n differentiating between some jurisdictions that don't\\n\\n collect the money until the conviction is final and a\\n\\n conviction that's overturned on collateral review where\\n\\n the possibility of money having been collected may\\n\\n exist? Should there be a difference in how we think\\n\\n about those two situations?</p><p> Should we be -</p><p> Well, I have a problem\\n\\n because there are some cases in our jurisprudence -- not\\n\\n in English jurisprudence, but certainly in American\\n\\n jurisprudence where the payment of restitution to a\\n\\n third party would have been good reason, an equitable\\n\\n reason for the State not to have to return that money.</p><p> So what do we do -</p><p> Paying the victim.</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>What does that mean?

And -- and no one, I think, has a  good answer to that question. There is just slightly  better, slightly worse.  So if you\\'re too tough in this case in  rejecting the notion that it was politics, which is  correlated with race, then what\\'s going to happen out  there to a successful effort to create majority-minority  districts where matters change, times change, oceans  rise, you know, et cetera?

I understand it. Believe me. And I -- I\\n\\n think that the problem in Cromartie II is it doesn\\'t say\\n\\n in all cases. I mean, it\\'s pretty clear. It\\'s -- I\\n\\n write that for a purpose. You know, the Court writes,\\n\\n when it says in a case like this one, it\\'s a little\\n\\n ambiguous, but it means it.</p><p> By the time as time\\n\\n progresses, as time progresses, we face what you see and\\n\\n I see as the problem right now, which is a set of\\n\\n standards that district courts can\\'t apply, which will\\n\\n try to separate sheep from goats, without us spending\\n\\n the entire term reviewing ,000-page records.

Despite that, everyone who comes in has to  have an alternative map. And, of course, if we have  five intervenors and so forth, we\\'re going to have five  or six different alternative maps drawing 400 -- I don\\'t  know, a hundred State legislatures and so forth.  That\\'s what I\\'m supposed to say?</p><p> So what -- what -- what is\\n\\n it that you suggest?

That\\'s what it seems to say.</p><p> Are you saying it doesn\\'t  really say that? You could say -- I mean, there are  many things you might say. I\\'m not suggesting the  answer. I want to know what you do say. Or you could  say, it doesn\\'t matter because we have a -- a -- giving  weight to the district court doesn\\'t matter, isn\\'t that  important.

Because when I\\n\\n go back to Cromartie II, I think he\\'s right. It does\\n\\n say that at least where the evidence is close, where\\n\\n it\\'s a close question, where one side is saying it\\'s\\n\\n racial, the other side is saying it\\'s political, then it\\n\\n says the party attacking the legislature\\'s boundaries\\n\\n has to show that the legislature could have achieved its\\n\\n legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that\\n\\n are equally consistent with traditional principles.\\n\\n Now, it does say that.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>But wasn't there a\\n\\n credibility finding?

And --</p><p> Isn't there substantial\\n\\n evidence that Congressman Watt comes in and he sits on\\n\\n the witness stand and he says, I had a conversation with\\n\\n the map drawer and the map drawer said that my bosses\\n\\n told me I have to get up over 50. percent black votes.</p><p> But isn't -- isn't it --</p><p> Not so easy, because we know\\n\\n that race and politics correlate. And the question\\n\\n is -- is not -- I mean, that's just a fact of the\\n\\n matter. But we've said, notwithstanding that, if race\\n\\n is your motive, you get one result; and if politics is\\n\\n \\n\\n your motive, you get another result.\\n\\n\\n\\n So these maps are actually hard to do, given\\n\\n the extent of correlation there is, but direct evidence\\n\\n of race-based -- which, I have to say, there really is\\n\\n some in this case, because the principal line-drawer\\n\\n says, they told me to get above 50 percent BVAP --\\n\\n direct evidence, you know, that basically makes the case\\n\\n for somebody.</p><p> But it's also a big thing to\\n\\n ask plaintiffs to come in with their own maps, if they\\n\\n have direct evidence that the State is doing race-based\\n\\n rather than politics-based districting.</p><p> Well, the question is: Is\\n\\n it? Right? I mean, that's the question that the\\n\\n district court was trying to answer. Is it politics or\\n\\n is it race? If it's politics, it's fine; if it's race,\\n\\n it's not.\\n\\n And -- and so let's just take a\\n\\n hypothetical. Not this case, but let's take a\\n\\n \\n  hypothetical, which is: A State really does decide to  do race-based districting. Says, we want to segregate  all the African-American voters; this is the way we want  to do it. But then they say, well, we'll -- we'll - we'll justify it based on politics, because that sounds  better, right?  So -- and -- but -- but there's lots of  direct evidence that, in fact, the justification is  politics, but the true reason is race.  Now, were you suggesting when you stood - when -- when -- in -- in -- in your -- in your first  statements there, were you suggesting that even if a  plaintiff comes in and has all this direct evidence that  they are really trying to do race, that the plaintiff  has to present its own maps?</p><p> What do you mean, you would\\n\\n have --</p><p> And why is that? I mean, it  seems like -- as though that's what they would say.  Why -- why wasn't that at issue?</p><p> Did the State ever put on  any evidence that that was necessary to avoid a  retrogression problem under Section ?</p><p> What is your view of when\\n\\n maps should be required?</p><p> Mr. Clement, that passage\\n\\n in -- in Cromartie II says in a case like this one.\\n\\n And -- and it's pretty clearly following off analysis\\n\\n of -- in a case with purely circumstantial evidence,\\n\\n rather than direct evidence of race-based districting.\\n\\n I think you would have heard it, and it\\n\\n would have sounded different if the Court had really\\n\\n meant that in every case where the question was, is this\\n\\n politics or is this race, there was a requirement to\\n\\n present maps. That passage just would have read a lot\\n\\n differently.</p><p> You didn't respond to it.</p><p> But because Senator Rucho\\n\\n apparently believed doing so was necessary to avoid\\n\\n retrogression for Section  purposes.

A lot of these  trademarks promote the commercial aspect, in fact, by  disparaging other groups. So they figure that it's a  way to promote sales. How do you tell the difference  between the commercial aspect of the trademark and the  noncommercial aspect?</p><p> Well, I guess I  don't understand yet your distinction why the  only-celebrating-Shakespeare program is -- is okay, but  the trademark one is not.

The government\\n\\n provides lots of services to the general public. And I\\n\\n don\\'t think you would say that those fall within the\\n\\n government program line of cases that you\\'re talking\\n\\n about, like providing police protection to the general\\n\\n public or providing fire protection to the general\\n\\n public. Those cost money and those are government\\n\\n programs. Can the government say, well, we\\'re going to\\n\\n \\n  provide protection for some groups, but not for other  groups?</p><p> Well, if they\\'re  inexplicably intertwined, then I -- I don\\'t understand  how we can separate them and apply to the expressive\\n \\n\\n part a more rigorous test than we would apply to the\\n\\n44\\n\\n commercial part.</p><p> All right. Do you think\\n\\n that viewpoint discrimination is always prohibited in\\n\\n commercial speech? For example, could the government\\n\\n say -- and maybe it already has said -- that a\\n\\n manufacturer of cigarettes could not place on a package\\n\\n of cigarettes \"Great for your health. Don\\'t believe the\\n\\n surgeon general\"?</p><p> Mr. Stewart, you really  think that speech can be restricted by the government on  the ground that foreign countries may object to it?  Could -- could the government do that with  copyright? I mean, an awful lot of things are  copyrighted in this country that are deeply offensive to  some foreign countries, and yet, the FBI enforces the  copyright laws.</p><p> I want to come back to  the -- the Chief Justice\\'s question. I really have  difficulty separating the expressive from the commercial  aspect of a trademark. Let me give you an example.  I think that Nike\\'s phrase \"Just Do It\" is a  registered trademark.

I -- I wouldn't ask it,\\n\\n but I think -- except that I think you do have something\\n\\n of an answer that you haven't fully expressed.\\n\\n Look. We're creating, through government, a\\n\\n form of a property right, a certain form. That's a\\n\\n trademark. It's as if through government we created a\\n\\n certain kind of physical property right that certain\\n\\n people could dedicate a small part of their houses or\\n\\n land to Peaceful Grove. And in Peaceful Grove, you\\n\\n write messages, but peaceful messages. And above all,\\n\\n \\n\\n you don't write messages that will provoke others to\\n\\n45\\n\\n violence or bad feelings. Okay?\\n\\n Anything wrong with that? I can't think of\\n\\n anything wrong with that. There are thousands of places\\n\\n where they can express hostile feelings. It's just in\\n\\n this tiny place, one-quarter of an acre, that you\\n\\n yourself have chosen to take advantage of that you can't\\n\\n because it will destroy the purpose. It will destroy\\n\\n the purpose of Peaceful Grove. That's why I asked my\\n\\n question.\\n\\n To what extent does interfering with\\n\\n viewpoints here serve a trademark-related purpose? As\\n\\n we can see how in Peaceful Grove or in Shakespeare, the\\n\\n messages that we were talking about did harm the\\n\\n government purpose. And here, they're saying similarly,\\n\\n disparaging messages get in the way of the objective of\\n\\n this program, which is to identify the source. Now,\\n\\n that, I think, is what I heard. That's what I'd like\\n\\n you to think about and respond to.</p><p> Well, I understand that.\\n\\n But now your answer -- okay, I've got your answer. And\\n\\n now your other answers were worrying me, because what's\\n\\n worrying me is I accept what you just said -- suppose I\\n\\n did; am I suddenly saying no Peaceful Grove, no\\n\\n Shakespeare celebration, no normal restrictions on\\n\\n normal restrictions, no function -- you know, it's\\n\\n functional, can't have functional things in a trademark,\\n\\n da, da, da, all the ones we read. If I buy into your\\n\\n answer just -- that you just gave, have I suddenly\\n\\n opened the door to striking down all those things?</p><p> Well, why not?</p><p> But time, place, or manner,  there is time, place, or manner. In fact, you can use  these words anywhere at any time in your performance.  Just don't use them as the registered source of the  message, I am the owner of the -- of the -- of the band.  Time, place, and manner. You have the entire universe  where you can say what you want, including this.  So why is this somehow not a restriction on  time, place, and manner if the others were?</p><p> Oh, my goodness. I mean,\\n\\n there are laws all over the place that stop you from\\n\\n saying that a competitor is -- has bad products. It's\\n\\n called product disparagement.

But you're saying the government  couldn't do that?</p><p> They could not stop that.\\n\\n They can't -- can they say Smith's beer is poison?</p><p> Well, not -- not conduct\\n\\n business. They can insult customers. Boy, you could\\n\\n have 50,000 insults on every physical item that you put\\n\\n out. All you cannot do is when it comes to a little\\n\\n mark or a form of words, it is designed to say one\\n\\n thing -- I'm repeating myself -- I am the source of the\\n\\n product. And you can do that in little letters, big\\n\\n letters, tiny letters, no letter, whatever. But there\\n\\n you have to stick to business, and if you're going to go\\n\\n beyond business, don't use insults.\\n\\n Do you believe that they can stop trademarks\\n\\n from saying -- this is the trademark you can't use --\\n\\n Joe Jones is a jerk?</p><p> Well, each of those -- and\\n\\n I know there are several -- are related to the ultimate\\n\\n purpose of a trademark, which is to identify the source\\n\\n of the product. So every trademark makes that\\n\\n statement.\\n\\n Now, what is -- what purpose or objective of\\n\\n trademark protection does this particular disparagement\\n\\n provision help along or further? And I'm thinking of\\n\\n the provision that says you can say something nice about\\n\\n a minority group, but you can't say something bad about\\n\\n them. With all the other -- I know the others -- I\\n\\n don't know all, but I know many of them, and I can\\n\\n relate that. You relate this.</p><p> Right.</p><p> It's not disparaging; your  answer was distracting. And -- and -- and one of the  great things of 99 percent of all trademarks is they  don't just identify; boy, do they distract. It's a form  of advertising. So if the answer is distracting, not - you didn't provide an answer to disparagement. You're  answer is why disparagement was they don't want  distraction from the message.</p><p> But that's where I have the  question. What relation is there to a particular type  of distraction, disparagement, and any purpose of a  trademark?</p><p> Why does that --</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> It isn't quite like that.\\n\\n After all, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, this is\\n\\n more like a single bulletin board on the train station.\\n\\n The train station which has a thousand bulletin boards.\\n\\n People can say whatever they want. But this bulletin\\n\\n board, one out of a thousand, is reserved today for\\n\\n people who want to say nice things about Shakespeare.\\n\\n This is not a general expression program.\\n\\n This is a program that has one objective. The objective\\n\\n is to identify the source of the product. It stops\\n\\n nobody from saying anything. All it says is when you're\\n\\n \\n33  trying to fulfill our objective, which is identify the  source of your product, if you want, put a little circle  with an R in it and write down beneath in tiny letters,  Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Anything you want. But in that  circle, not the thing that says the insulting thing  about somebody else. See? Very much like one  Shakespeare celebration board out of a million. Let me  say  million to make the point stronger. Do you see?  That's -- that -- that's where you can't express  yourself, so -- and then I said to them, well, why do  you do that? And they said because, you know, the  purpose of a -- of a trademark is to identify a source.  It's not to get people into extraneous arguments. And  what this will do is it will get people into extraneous  arguments, losing or diluting the force of a program  that seeks to use a trademark to identify a source.  Now, that's what I got out of my answer to  the last question on the other side, and I would like to  know what you think.</p><p> I don't care what their  position is. I want to know what you think in respect  to the question I'm asking.</p><p> I have it. Right. I want  to get the answer to my question because that is the one  question I have for you.  The only question I have for you is what  purpose related to trademarks objective does this serve?  And I want to be sure I have your answer. Your answer  so far was, it prevents the -- or it helps to prevent  the user of the product from being distracted from the  basic message, which is, I made this product.\\n \\n  I take it that's your answer. And if that's  your answer, I will -- my follow-up question to that  would be, I can think probably, and with my law clerks,  perhaps 50,000 examples of instances where the space the  trademark provides is used for very distracting  messages, probably as much or more so than the one at  issue, or disparagement. And what business does  Congress have picking out this one, but letting all the  other distractions exist?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>But suppose the -- the  application here had been for Slants Are Superior. So  that\\'s a complimentary term. Would that then be -- take  it outside the disparagement bar?</p><p> It takes the sting out of  the word.</p><p> There\\'s no restriction  on -- on the trademark.</p><p> There\\'s a significant  difference between the copyright regime, you can\\'t sue  for copyright infringement unless you register. Isn\\'t  that so?</p><p> And just as importantly,  because your time is running, the questions have  concentrated on viewpoint discrimination, but there\\'s  also a large concern with vagueness here, and the list  that we have of things that were trademarked and things  that weren\\'t. Take, for example, one had the word  \"Heb,\" and that was okay in one application and it was  not okay in another.</p><p> Because that\\'s the same  thing.</p><p> It\\'s not because -- it\\'s\\n \\n  not because of the content or the viewpoint expressed,  it\\'s just it\\'s a short phrase, and any short phrase  would be no good. This is -- this is -- you can\\'t say  Slants because the PTO thinks that\\'s a bad word. Does  it not count at all that everyone knows that The Slants  is using this term not at all to disparage, but simply  to describe?</p><p> What about scandalous?  That\\'s another one. Scandalous or immoral. Those are  just like disparaged. They block you from registering  the mark; right?</p><p> Now, that\\'s saying you  cannot trademark a slogan that has one of George  Carlin\\'s seven day -- dirty words in it.  (Laughter.)</p><p> If you were to use one of  those seven words, we won\\'t register your trademark.</p><p> Yes, but -</p><p> -- due to this Court\\'s  specific decision, which said it was okay to ban those  words from the airwaves -</p><p> But then -- now, this - this is not, yeah, you can have trademark protection,\\n \\n36  but we\\'re not going to let you get the extra benefits of  registration. It\\'s you can\\'t use those words on the  air, and this Court upheld it.</p><p> But doesn\\'t the\\n\\n government have some interest in disassociating itself\\n\\n from racial ethnic slur -- slurs? Things like, what\\n\\n about the license -- Texas license, vanity license\\n\\n plate, and they said we won\\'t do one with the\\n\\n Confederate flag.</p><p> Would you say the same  thing about a scandalous mark? Would that be equally  impermissible?</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>But why does that --</p><p> -- matter?</p><p> I mean, maybe the government\\n\\n just decides we want to celebrate everything. We want\\n\\n to be relentlessly positive.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Can I -</p><p> There are potential -- there  are potential First Amendment problems, too, if the  nature of the distinction was based on the person's  speech; isn't that right?</p><p> So absolutely clearly if it  was based on viewpoint. And -- and so I guess I don't  want to interrupt your answer to Justice Alito, if - but I want to get back to -- because I don't really  understand the answer that you gave me before. You said  a government regulation that distinguished between  saying politicians are good and virtuous and politicians  are corrupt would clearly be viewpoint-based; is that  right?</p><p> So -- and similarly, if you  said that the flag is a wonderful emblem, this -- this  applies to national symbols -</p><p> -- but you could say that  the flag is a wonderful emblem, but you can't say that  the flag is a terrible emblem.</p><p> That would be  viewpoint-based.</p><p> I mean, that's what this - this regulation does.</p><p> It says you can say one of  those things, but you can't say the other and get  trademark.</p><p> But that's like saying it\\n\\n does so much viewpoint-based discrimination that it\\n\\n becomes all right.</p><p> Yes, yes. And -- and I'm\\n\\n willing to give you that. But even government programs,\\n\\n again, assuming it's not government speech itself, even\\n\\n government programs are subject to this constraint,\\n\\n which is that you can't distinguish based on the\\n\\n viewpoint of a speaker.</p><p> Well, one of the things,\\n\\n Mr. Connell, that troubles me about this case is that\\n\\n it's not quite as simple as just saying, well, here's a\\n\\n government program and the government is discriminating\\n\\n on the basis of viewpoint, because there are aspects of\\n\\n this program that seem like government speech itself,\\n\\n maybe not quite that, but something approaching it,\\n\\n which is the program says that anything that's\\n\\n registered, the government publishes in its own\\n\\n publication. The government sends to foreign countries,\\n\\n again, in its own publication. So the whole program is\\n\\n geared in such a way that individual marks that are\\n\\n registered end up being -- I doubt anybody would ascribe\\n\\n them to the government, but the government republishes\\n\\n them, communicates them and so forth. And doesn't that\\n\\n aspect of the program give the government greater leeway\\n\\n \\n\\n here than it would in a typical program in which no\\n\\n39\\n\\n government speech itself is involved?</p><p> Well, Mr. Connell, this\\n\\n can't be right, because think of all the other things,\\n\\n the other -- I mean, I'll call them content distinctions\\n\\n because they are -- that trademark law just makes. I\\n\\n mean, Section  prohibits the registration of any mark\\n\\n that's falsely suggestive of a connection with persons\\n\\n likely to cause confusion, descriptive, misdescriptive,\\n\\n functional, a geographic indication for wine or spirits,\\n\\n government insignia, a living person's name, portrait,\\n\\n or signature. You couldn't make any of those\\n\\n distinctions in a -- in a -- in a public park, and yet,\\n\\n of course, you can make them in trademark law, can't\\n\\n \\n\\n you?\\n\\n42</p><p> Well, these might be\\n\\n viewpoint-neutral, but they're certainly not\\n\\n content-neutral, and yet we would -- I mean, I think\\n\\n that a challenge to many of these would fall flat.</p><p> Because -- like, how is\\n\\n trademark law supposed to function unless it can make\\n\\n these kinds of distinctions?</p><p> Well --</p><p> -- okay. If those would\\n\\n survive, then this is not a public park, because those\\n\\n would not survive in a public park.</p><p> There's something different\\n\\n here, in other words, that this is coming up in the\\n\\n context of a government program --</p><p> -- which provides certain  benefits that the government doesn't have to provide at  all.</p><p> No, no, no. That's -- it - as I said, even in a government program, even assuming  that this is not just a classic speech restriction,  you're still subject to the constraint that you can't  discriminate on -- on the basis of viewpoint.</p><p> Assume government speech\\n\\n itself is not involved. I always thought that\\n\\n government programs were subject to one extremely\\n\\n important constraint, which is that they can't make\\n\\n distinctions based on viewpoint.\\n\\n So why isn't this doing exactly that?</p><p> Mr. Stewart, please.</p><p> Yes. Well, that's\\n\\n absolutely true. It -- it precludes disparagement of\\n\\n Democrats and Republicans alike, and so forth and so on,\\n\\n but it makes a very important distinction, which is that\\n\\n you can say good things about some person or group, but\\n\\n you can't say bad things about some person or group.\\n\\n So, for example, let's say that I wanted a\\n\\n mark that expressed the idea that all politicians are\\n\\n corrupt, or just that Democrats are corrupt. Either\\n\\n way, it doesn't matter. I couldn't get that mark, even\\n\\n though I could get a mark saying that all politicians\\n\\n are virtuous, or that all Democrats are virtuous.\\n\\n Either way, it doesn't matter. You see the point.\\n\\n The point is that I can say good things\\n\\n about something, but I can't say bad things about\\n\\n something. And I would have thought that that was a\\n\\n \\n\\n fairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination.</p><p> But why isn't that this?</p><p> Well, that's libelism, one\\n\\n of our historically different, but very distinct\\n\\n categories. And you don't make the claim that this\\n\\n falls into a category of low value speech in the way\\n\\n that libel laws and the way that defamation does or\\n\\n fighting words or something like that. And you're not\\n\\n looking to create a new category.\\n\\n So in that case, it seems that the\\n\\n viewpoint-based ban applies, and -- and this -- as I\\n\\n said, I would be interested to hear your answer of why\\n\\n the example that I stated is not viewpoint-based. It\\n\\n says you can say something bad about -- you can say\\n\\n something good about somebody, but not something bad\\n\\n about somebody or something.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>You want us to say that\\n\\n trademark law is just like a public park -- the public\\n\\n park, a public forum, the classic example of where you\\n\\n can say anything you want.

That's your\\n\\n argument.</p><p> But in your view, the\\n\\n Congress could not draw a statute, even different to\\n\\n this, to make the distinction that the hypotheticals\\n\\n points out, and the Congress, in your view, could draw\\n\\n no statute denying trademark protection in the\\n\\n hypothetical case.</p><p> I think you have to take\\n\\n that position.</p><p> The First Amendment  protects absolutely outrageous speech insofar as\\n \\n\\n trademarks are concerned.</p><p> Suppose we had this  hypothetical case.

But your  argument earlier was that if someone slanders or libels  an individual by saying -- Trump before he was a public  figure -- Trump is a thief and that becomes their  trademark, that even if they go to court and prove that  that's a libel or a slander, that trademark would still  exist and would be capable of use because otherwise  canceling it would be an abridgement of the First  Amendment?</p><p> Let's go back to, if we  can, the earlier part of Justice Breyer's question.  1052 has two components. You can't  disparage or falsely suggest a connection with a person  institution. Are you challenging or saying that the  second part of 1052 falsely suggests the connection is  unconstitutional as well?</p><p> Excuse me.</p><p> He's just not getting as  much as he would like, but he's not stopped from doing  what he's doing.</p><p> But I have --</p><p> Then I have a question\\n\\n for you. This is a bit different than most cases. No\\n\\n one is stopping your client from calling itself The\\n\\n Slants. No one is stopping them from advertising\\n\\n \\n  themselves that way, or signing contracts that way, or  engaging in any activity, except that stopping someone  else from using the same trademark. But even that they  could do. Because you don't need a registered trademark  to sue under the Lanham Act's entitlement for the  confusion of the public in the use of any kind of  registered or unregistered mark. If another band called  themselves Slants, they would be subject to deceptive  advertisements because they wouldn't be this Slants.  So there is a big difference. You are  asking the government to endorse your name to the extent  of protecting it in a way that it chooses not to. So  it -- there is a reason why the argument's appealing.  And why shouldn't we consider it in those ways when your  speech is not being burdened in any traditional way?</p><p> It doesn't answer my  question.

GERSHENGORN\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\\n\\n IN NOS. -1358 AND -1359</p><p> Well, I suppose one\\n\\n answer would be the normal injunctive action would\\n\\n challenge the constitutionality of the policy, which\\n\\n would seem, at least at first blush, to be a more\\n\\n appropriate way of doing it than to -- than individual\\n\\n damages actions against officials responsible.</p><p> I understand that.\\n\\n But the point made by your friend on the other side,\\n\\n though, of overdeterrence, when you have the attorney\\n\\n general, the director of the FBI, the director of INS\\n\\n sitting down and making -- what are we going to do to\\n\\n respond to this crisis, and -- and people in the -- were\\n\\n of -- old enough, /, sort of have a better sense of\\n\\n what that crisis was like.\\n\\n And if you imply a Bivens actions, one of\\n\\n the things they're going to enter into, what is best,\\n\\n what is appropriate, and presumably also, what's\\n\\n constitutional. They're going to say, well, gosh, if,\\n\\n you know, I'm wrong, I'm going to -- I'm going to be\\n\\n sued, not because I'm the attorney general, but as an -\\n\\n as an individual. And -- and part of the policy that\\n\\n we've announced is that we don't want people forming\\n\\n policy to have to worry about they're going to have to\\n\\n -- to pay if the -- if the policy is found infirm.</p><p> I guess my point\\n\\n is -- is a different one. I understand the argument\\n\\n that there are constitutional violations. But the\\n\\n question that you're asking the Court to do is to shape\\n\\n a remedy for that, a remedy that Congress has not\\n\\n provided. And to look at it in the simplest terms, I\\n\\n mean, it has been 40-whatever years since we adopted an\\n\\n approach to implied rights of action under statutes\\n\\n where we say if Congress wants people to be allowed to\\n\\n bring individual damages actions, they pretty much have\\n\\n to say so.\\n\\n \\n32  And it seems to me that it's the same  approach here except, of course, you're dealing with the  Constitution. And the idea that the Court lacks the  institutional competency, okay, there's -- there's a  constitutional claim against a national policy. We  think the best way to consider that constitutional  challenge is to allow people to sue individuals  responsible for implementing it for damages.  You shape the policy, the national  government in response to /, therefore, you have to  pay money because it's been a determination that that  was unconstitutional.</p><p> It was to detain  those individuals until they were properly cleared and  could be -- could be released. Now, you may disagree  with that approach to the policy, but what concerns me  and why the restraint is appropriate in the Bivens  context, is that it is a way of challenging national\\n \\n policy through damages actions against the individuals\\n\\n31\\n\\n implementing it. And I think that is an extraordinary\\n\\n departure from where we have recognized Bivens remedies\\n\\n in the past.</p><p> I'm not sure I  understand your point. It was -- it was the  implementation of national security policy in response  to the / attacks, and the -- it was to detain people.  Every one of the individuals detained was in violation  of their immigration status; right?</p><p> Does that role  include the shaping and an announcement, really, of  private damages remedies?

I mean, I think it is an enormously important and very  open question. And we can say on the one hand, just  what was said. I think everything the Chief Justice  said is true. There is a problem, in this time, of real  national emergency, to overdeter people from doing what  they reasonably think is necessary. And they have the  authority for security, not the judges.  At the same time, the law of this Court  correctly, I think is, but there\\'s no blank check even  for the President. And if there\\'s no blank check, that  means sometimes they can go too far. And if they have  gone too far, it is our job to say that.\\n \\n35  Now, there are considerable advantages, as I  pointed out, saying, at the time they\\'re going to say  yes, because there\\'s a big frightening thing happening.  But maybe they went too far too fast, and then this  offers a remedy later and maybe the deterrence is good.  Okay? You see both sides.</p><p> Has that been fully argued  in this case? If I go and look in the record, can I  find a question that I have wondered about for quite a  long time fully answered?</p><p> The FBI goes into a rooming\\n\\n house after having information there\\'s a nuclear weapon\\n \\n on the floor. They find it. And there might be\\n\\n45\\n\\n another. Would they be justified in taking into custody\\n\\n every single person in that rooming house and looking\\n\\n into it? I mean, for how long? Would you say to them,\\n\\n no, you can\\'t do it because we don\\'t know, there are\\n\\n people on the floor, they knew nothing about them,\\n\\n actually. They admit it. We knew nothing about them.\\n\\n All we know is they\\'re in the rooming house.</p><p> And we also know there was\\n\\n a nuclear weapon. And that isn\\'t totally fanciful; it\\n\\n could happen. And -- and so what are they supposed to\\n\\n do and how long?</p><p> In a set of cases.</p><p> And you say it in  paragraph -- in paragraph 74, it says, \"Indeed, after a  few months of interacting with the plaintiffs, the MDC  defendants\" -- I take it those are the people we\\'re  talking about -- \"realized that they were not  terrorists, but merely immigration detainees; yet the  restrictive conditions and harsh treatment continued.\"  So what is that but an allegation that they  did know about it and they did continue the harsh  treatment?</p><p> Okay. I\\'m worried about -</p><p> I used a historic example  and I\\'m not worried about this case.</p><p> Yeah, yeah.</p><p> This went on for several\\n\\n months, eight months.</p><p> Yes, but weren\\'t -</p><p> -- weren\\'t they held for\\n\\n eight months?</p><p> No I can -</p><p> So I can understand after a  bomb attack. I can understand after a bomb attack and  ,000 people are killed. I can understand that the  first reaction of the law enforcement authorities is,  pick up anybody you might think is connected, and we\\'ll  worry about the rest of it later.  Now, eight months? Now, what they do allege  is that Ashcroft and Mueller knew that the FBI had not  developed any reliable evidence -- that\\'s  paragraph 67 -- tying the plaintiffs to terrorism, but  authorized their prolonged detention, in restrictive  conditions, and Mueller, it says, ordered that they be  kept in INS custody, and including the restrictive  conditions, even after local offices reported. Ah, they  don\\'t say reported to whom, so that is a point in your  favor, but that there was no reason to suspect them of  terrorism.  But I think, fairly read, they are saying -  they -- okay. They authorized it. They knew that some  of these people had no information against them, but the\\n \\n answer is pick up anybody who might have a connection,\\n\\n\\n\\n and then just keep them there? I mean, that\\'s what\\'s\\n\\n worrying me a lot. And why doesn\\'t that at least state\\n\\n an allegation?\\n\\n Suppose it had been five years. Suppose it\\n\\n had been ten years.

And they might find,  that in some of those instances, there was no  justification whatsoever. And I look at the Bivens  remedy and say, one, it has a cautionary effect. It  doesn\\'t deter where necessary, where necessary, and then  where a big mistake was made, it has the possibility of  compensation later.

Anybody who sells anything?</p><p> I'm going to say when I  first read this statute without knowing anything about  the background with the Federal statute or reading the\\n \\n  briefs or the Second Circuit opinion, I interpreted it  the way Justice Sotomayor did, that it mandates a single  price. Now, that may be a -- an uninformed  interpretation, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable about  ruling on the constitutionality of this statute without  knowing how the court of appeals, New York court of  appeals would interpret the statute.  So why shouldn't we certify that question of  interpretation to that court before we plunge into this  First Amendment issue?</p><p> There are many.  So you tell us how you interpret this, but  how do we know how all of these other district attorneys  are going to interpret the statute?

But, see, that's a -</p><p> Could I just ask you a  preliminary question about the division of litigation  authority in New York State? Does the attorney general  or the solicitor general have the authority under New  York law to bind all of the district attorneys in the  State to an interpretation of this statute? And has the  attorney general issued a -- an official interpretation  so that all of the district attorneys will be required  to -- to enforce this in the same way?</p><p> Well, under that  interpretation, if it's okay to post the higher price  and nothing more, and if the higher price is the credit  card price, they are -- they are forcing the merchant to  speak in a particular way.</p><p> Does this apply -</p><p> Well, if I had the authority  to interpret the New York statute, which I really don't,  and I saw that they copied part of a prior statute, but  they deliberately omitted other parts of the prior  statute, I would be tempted to infer that they had a  reason for omitting the definitions. And that was that  they didn't want to be bound by that, so they wanted  something different.</p><p> Then why didn't New York - I mean, New York adopted this against the backdrop of a  lot of consideration at the Federal level. Why did it  not adopt the Federal definitions?</p><p> Can I go back to --</p><p> -- Justice Kagan's\\n\\n hypothetical. It doesn't address the situation where\\n\\n dual prices are posted, but it addresses a situation\\n\\n where there is a dual-price regime. Some consumers are\\n\\n going to pay more; some consumers are going to pay less.</p><p> And in her hypothetical, she\\n\\n says the sticker price is the higher price. And then\\n\\n \\n  when the cash purchaser comes to the cash register, the  purchaser gets a pleasant surprise. No, you are going  to be charged less.  But I thought your argument was that this - if that is the correct interpretation of the statute,  and -- and I don't really know what the statute means  and we don't have a definitive interpretation. But if  that is the correct interpretation of the statute, what  New York State has done is to force the merchant to  say -- to post a particular sticker price -- namely, the  higher sticker price -- as opposed to the lower sticker  price.  So that is mandated speech. Isn't that your  argument?</p><p> I mean, suppose some kids  have a lemonade stand or they're washing cars and they  say a glass of lemonade, $ and then somebody comes up  to them and says I'd like to buy that with a credit  card. It might happen today.

These are tech savvy kids so they  can -- could process a credit card purchase if they  wanted to?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>You can think of examples  which I can\\'t. In areas like energy, people who make  their own energy who use time-of-day metering, there  could be lots of regulatory rules that affect how an  energy company presents the pricing of this element or  that element included. Now, if I think that in all  these areas the correct First Amendment standard is  rational basis, nothing stronger, how then do I  distinguish the cases which you\\'ve talked about how  you -- what you say in respect to price because after  all, even if it\\'s just evidentiary, this statute does  affect what people say as to price. So if in fact I  need a legal distinction here to get at what I think the  First Amendment is driving at, what\\'s your best effort?\\n \\n58</p><p> That is, you tell me, given  precedent, et cetera, what should we overrule? Or what  should we narrow? If, as I believe is true, these  regulatory areas are areas that not normal First  Amendment, \"tough, you can\\'t do it\" principles apply - weakened forms might because it applies everywhere in a  sense. But it used to be rational basis. It used to be  rational basis. But water has flowed over that dam or  under that bridge or whatever, and so I want to know  your best thinking on what you would do in terms of  trying to write a rule of law that would favor you.\\n \\n48</p><p> All right. Help me. I may  be the only one that needs this help, but I do have this  Lockner problem.  One, if this -- if I were a legislature - legislator, I would have voted against this statute. I  think it does hide the cost. That has nothing to do  with this.  Two, I think that the reason we\\'re having so  much trouble is because it\\'s so difficult, but not  impossible, to distinguish between surcharge and  discount. And if you want to distinguish -- and they  are different -- words are very helpful. They\\'re  evidentiary. But what we\\'re after is not the words.\\n \\n47  They\\'re evidentiary of something. But that\\'s all almost  we have.  Three, the fact that you have the questions  you\\'ve had and both sides of the bench have had such  trouble with this, to me, is strong evidence that the  Court should stay out of this under normal First  Amendment standards. Because if we don\\'t, we are going  to discover all kinds of price regulation all over the  place that suffers to greater or lesser degrees from  this kind of problem, and you\\'ll have judges all over  the country substituting for regulators and others in  trying to regulate. That\\'s where I\\'m coming from.  Now, you tell me how to do it.</p><p> Go ahead. Are you  finished?</p><p> Did they say call it a\\n\\n discount?</p><p> You can charge more all you\\n\\n want.</p><p> -- or did they say you can\\n\\n have a discount?</p><p> Did they say, do exactly  the same thing --</p><p> But they did say, you can  do exactly the same thing?</p><p> Well, now, this is exactly  what\\'s worrying me. The State, you say, told some  merchants that they cannot say that they have a  surcharge. Is that what it is? Is that the problem?</p><p> Not in the way -- you have  the regular price. If you go above the regular price,  it\\'s a surcharge. If you go below the regular price,\\n \\n\\n it\\'s a discount.</p><p> But we live in a world that  not everybody is an economist, and many people think  it\\'s quite a different thing, and there are a lot of  studies in this thing that the -- you know, that said it  was a different thing. That\\'s what they can\\'t do.</p><p> But you can charge a  discount.  Now, I know, Paul MacAvoy, I hate to bring  up these long-gone names, but he was an economist with  whom I wrote a book. And he would have said what you  said, that, well, a discount and a surcharge are the  same thing economically.</p><p> I don\\'t see that in the  statute. My statute that I\\'m reading says you can\\'t  charge a surcharge.</p><p> -- that violates the First  Amendment or at least potentially because they do it  through speech.</p><p> Unless you want to say  whenever a businessman is regulated in what he can do,  or she -</p><p> Not only doesn\\'t it scream  it, I want to know -</p><p> So explain to me what it\\'s  got to do with speech.</p><p> What\\'s that got to do with  speech? I grant you, all business activity takes place  through speech.</p><p> And you want to.</p><p> And very well what this  statute says is, you can\\'t impose a surcharge. Very  well, you can\\'t.</p><p> Because we want to charge\\n\\n $.</p><p> And after they said that in\\n\\n World War II, you couldn\\'t charge a higher price.\\n\\n Would you have come in and said, Ken\\n\\n Galbraith says you can only charge $ for this item.\\n\\n It violates our free speech.</p><p> Ken Galbraith ran it for\\n\\n awhile. And they would -- what they would do, he said\\n\\n is they\\'d go around and they\\'d smell what the right\\n\\n price was.</p><p> It\\'s called the Office of\\n\\n Price Administration.</p><p> Then what\\'s the problem\\n\\n with saying -- you -- you don\\'t -- you\\'re too young to\\n\\n know what the OPA was.</p><p> They want to do more. They\\n \\n\\n want to impose a surcharge.</p><p> So what we are doing here\\n\\n is we are taking all the principles which are important\\n\\n of a First Amendment case and we are going to apply them\\n\\n speedy determination not as applied, you know, across\\n\\n the board. There are lots of protective things. And we\\n\\n are diving headlong into an area called price\\n\\n regulation.\\n\\n It is a form of price regulation, and price\\n\\n regulation goes on all over the place in regulatory\\n\\n agencies. And so the word that I fear begins with an L\\n\\n and ends with an R; it\\'s called Lockner. And there we\\n\\n go.\\n\\n Using the First Amendment as a tool to get\\n\\n \\n  at price regulation that enforcers will sometimes say  the wrong thing. Okay? So that\\'s a very general  question. But if you want to know what\\'s worrying me,  that\\'s it.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>What did the other -</p><p> -- the other States that  picked up after the Feds didn't renew the statute, what  did the other States do?</p><p> Did they do what New York  did or did they copy the Federal statute?</p><p> But it doesn't set a  standing price. It doesn't set any price at all. It  lets the merchant set the price. And the question is  how that price is described. So I think it's quite  different from OPA ceiling prices, which says you cannot  charge more than the ceiling price. Here, the sky is  the limit as to what the -- the merchants can charge.  New York is not regulating what the price of the goods  are.</p><p> If we -- if we agree with  the government that this is because it affects how the  merchant characterizes his price, would you also take  the position that the government takes that it's  justified as a disclosure law?</p><p> Can you explain to me how  it's a disclosure requirement to suppress the actual  cost of the credit card purchase?</p><p> No. I thought that there  was some legislation that permitted -</p><p> As far as discounts are\\n\\n concerned, is there some protection that the merchant\\n\\n can offer a discount?</p><p> Were there any\\n\\n prosecutions under the Federal?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Let\\'s take that out of the  picture. Even then the law can say, the only thing that  we are requiring is that you list the higher price.  That\\'s the only thing that we are requiring. And then  you can describe what you\\'re doing any way you like.  You can use the word \"surcharge.\" You can use the word  \"more.\" You can use the word \"less.\" You can use the  word \"discount.\" It doesn\\'t matter. So long as you  list the higher price, you\\'re in the clear. And that,  too, is very different from what you\\'re saying, maybe  from what the prosecutor said. But just the way you  read this law, it just doesn\\'t give -- I mean, what  these prosecutors say don\\'t match what the law says.</p><p> Mr. Gupta, you\\'re putting  really a lot of emphasis on a few cases in which  prosecutors describe the law in a certain way. But the  law as written doesn\\'t really do any of the things that  you\\'re saying. I mean, Justice Alito is right. The law  as written actually can be read -- and Justice Sotomayor  said this before -- as just requiring a single price.  Now, that\\'s something that none of the parties here say,  but if you just look at the law, that\\'s what the law  says.</p><p> The law says, you know, this  is all about listing, you know, conduct; what you can  charge.</p><p> Well, New York is saying in  its brief that that\\'s not the case; that you can say  what you want to say; that you can call this a  surcharge; that you can communicate in the way you want  to communicate as long as your listed price is the -- is  the credit card price.</p><p> You said if you take the  statute, if you understand the statute to just mean that  the listed price has to be the credit card price, that  looks like a disclosure regime. Could you explain that?</p><p> But, you know, there does  seem to have been a debate about what this statute  means. Because I look at some of this enforcement  history and I think -- I don\\'t really understand why  this violates that law. And, in fact, you\\'ve walked  away from some of that enforcement history in your  briefing and said, look, the cashier can call it  whatever she wants to call it as long as the listed  price is the credit card price. But that is  contradicting some of this enforcement history where a  different understanding of this law was used.  So how do we deal with that?</p><p> Can I ask you a different  question? It -- it does -- this does not look like a  disclosure requirement. It just -- I mean, one way to  understand this is exactly what you said. It -- it  requires disclosure. Whether everybody needs that  disclosure, whether only a few people need that  disclosure in the $. case, but it requires  disclosure to make sure that everybody is on the same  page in terms of knowing prices.  But if you look at the language of the  statute, it just doesn\\'t look like that. And -- and if  we\\'re going to say that something is a disclosure\\n \\n39  requirement and so subject to a lesser forum of First  Amendment review, shouldn\\'t the State be making clear  that that\\'s what this is?</p><p> I\\'m sorry. You said  something very interesting.</p><p> Could I -- I feel it -- I\\'m  sorry.</p><p> Well, isn\\'t the idea,\\n\\n Mr. Feigin, that if you said 32.46 plus  percent, then\\n\\n you really are requiring people to do some work and\\n\\n you\\'d rather just have them know that it\\'s -- see, I\\n\\n can\\'t do it that fast.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> And -- and your\\n\\n understanding of why it is a speech regulation, it -- is\\n\\n because it affects the way you list prices; is that\\n\\n right?</p><p> Well, I guess that\\'s why I  said like what speech precisely, and you said the  message that you\\'re going to pay more if you use a  credit card.</p><p> The latter one.</p><p> Mr. Gupta, this exchange - I mean, I think that these are two very different  theories of what makes this a speech restriction. And I  guess the reason I asked my question was because Justice  Alito\\'s theory does not appear to be your theory, and I  want to know which theory we\\'re really talking about  here.  Justice Alito\\'s theory is that when the  legislation says you have to post the higher price, that  that in itself is a restriction on speech. And that\\'s  an interesting argument, and maybe he\\'s right about  that. I don\\'t know.  Now, your brief took a different position.  Your brief essentially said the problem is that this - this -- this legislation affects the way a cashier or  somebody in a store -- just affects -- it affects the  way they describe transactions generally, you know, and  the cashier is going to be worried that she can\\'t say to  the customer, you charge more if you use a credit card.  And I guess I wanted to know, which theory is your  theory?</p><p> Mr. Gupta, what -- what\\n\\n speech precisely do you think is being restricted?</p><p> See, that\\'s what you keep --\\n\\n you -- you said that again --</p><p> Even though you\\'re\\n\\n describing something as a surcharge. Because -- the\\n\\n reason it wouldn\\'t violate the law is because the\\n\\n conduct is, you know -- it -- it fits the law, right,\\n\\n that essentially you\\'re not imposing a surcharge on\\n\\n credit card users. Whatever you call it, however you\\n\\n describe it, you\\'re not imposing a surcharge on credit\\n\\n card users.</p><p> You don\\'t think it would.</p><p> You don\\'t know? How would\\n\\n it violate the law?</p><p> Now, would that violate this  law?</p><p> And -- and the cashier says,  oh, no. For you it\\'s 95 cents because I impose a  surcharge for people who use credit cards; right?</p><p> But, you know, as -- this - this statute is not written in terms of speech, it\\'s - it\\'s written in terms of imposing a surcharge. And - and let\\'s say that somebody -- let\\'s say that there is a  merchant and the merchant charges the list price for  something as a dollar and the person comes up to the  cash register and offers a dollar bill.</p><p> -- and I think my  hypothetical was designed to show that that\\'s just not  right.  I mean, I can imagine ways in which you  might say that this is restricting speech, but that\\'s  not it. Because as long as the price listed is the  higher price, is the price that a credit card company  has to pay, as long as that\\'s true, you can describe it  any which way you please. And you can describe it in  terms of impose -- of -- of imposing a surcharge or  charging credit card customers more, and it still is not  going to violate this law.</p><p> That was something that the  Second Circuit did not decide, said it was abstaining  on. It seems to me that that\\'s quite relevant to this  question of whether this is a disclosure requirement.  Because if the dual pricing scheme is not legal, it is  really hard to characterize this as a disclosure  requirement.  Would you agree with that?</p><p> I mean, here\\'s the narrow  way in which this seems to affect communication, speech.  I\\'m a seller. I set my prices. I say I want to charge  cash customers a dollar and I want to charge credit card  customers $.05. All right? Now, if I put my list  price as $.05 and then the cash customers get a happy  surprise, that seems fine. But if I put my list price  as a dollar and then the credit card companies get a  not-so-happy surprise, that can\\'t be done. So it does  affect the way a seller communicates which price he\\'s  going to say is the regular price, is the list price.  So why isn\\'t that a speech regulation? Now,  you might say, as the solicitor general does, it is a  speech regulation, but it\\'s only a disclosure regulation  and subject to a lower standard. But you\\'re saying it\\'s  not a speech regulation at all. And I want to know why,  given that it is affecting which price you choose to say  is your list price.</p><p> Mr. Wu, you think, is this  not true, that the dual pricing scheme is legal; is that  right?</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>But suppose -- suppose\\n\\n in -- in the heating oil example they said, it's $103,\\n\\n but cash is $100, and that's because we impose a\\n\\n surcharge. Would that be lawful?</p><p> Yeah, right.</p><p> I thought it was $ and   cents, but I'll think about that while - (Laughter.)</p><p> -- what is your position  as to the constitutionality of prohibiting Options B and  C in the pastrami sandwich example on -</p><p> Well, but --</p><p> Now, if -- if that - if -- if B or C as stated are a violation of the New\\n \\n35  York statute, in your view, is that a violation of the  First Amendment?</p><p> But under your view, if  the heating oil people had said, it's $103 if you pay by  credit card; if you do not pay by credit card, pay by  cash, it's $100, that is lawful?</p><p> Then it's a matter of how\\n \\n\\n the pricing structure is communicated --\\n\\n43</p><p> -- in the speech.</p><p> Even though this is  truthful information.</p><p> But suppose that a  business makes a point of its reputation is -- is  meeting all prices. We meet prices. And there is a  business that's very close to another State and the  other State allows cash, has -- has an option where all  surcharges are permitted and surcharges are -- are  disclosed. Then the State -- the seller in this State  says, you know, we will charge the lowest price, we will  meet the price, but we add  cents for credit cards.  And because that's difficult to enforce, all of our  prices are increased by  percent for everybody because  of the difficulty of applying surcharges in some cases.

How many of them, you haven\\'t  quite told me. How you differ, you haven\\'t quite told  me. And -- but I\\'m going to assume the Federal  definitions apply, even though none of them are used  here.  So I\\'m -- I\\'m very confused why you\\'re\\n \\n49  starting your answer to Justice Breyer by saying, look  at the statute and see what the words of the statute are  doing.</p><p> No, I don\\'t, because I\\n\\n know I have to pay sales tax.</p><p> And every -- and every\\n\\n State I have to figure out what that sales tax is and\\n\\n I\\'ve got to do the math in my own head.</p><p> Is your answer to the  reply brief examples the same as the solicitor general\\'s  office? And do you have a concern the way it does that  the statute could be read more broadly?</p><p> I\\'m sorry. I -- I - you\\'re two groups of -- of Petitioners. One wants to  just give a cash price without any information about the  surcharge, and the other, I thought, wanted to give two  separate prices. So not everybody doesn\\'t want to give  truthful information about the surcharge.</p><p> That\\'s not what I\\n\\n understood, but your adversary can tell me.</p><p> Mr. Feigin, could you\\n\\n get more concrete for me? Take the list of four ways\\n\\n \\n30  that they would like to advertise in the reply brief.  Which ways do you think -- or would the New  York law potentially or actually make any of this  conduct illegal?</p><p> Why?</p><p> -- you would have to  say $..</p><p> Fine. So look at  this -- if that\\'s what this law means, which of these  four ways of advertising would be permissible and which  would be unpermissible?\\n \\n31</p><p> So you think the Federal\\n \\n\\n law was unconstitutional as well.</p><p> Counselor, can I - I\\'m -- part of -- I\\'m a little bit like Justice Alito  and less than Justice Kagan. I\\'m not sure what you or  anybody is saying about this statute or what it means,  but not because it\\'s necessarily vague. I just don\\'t  see anything about speech in the statute.</p><p> The statute simply says,  \"No seller in any sales transaction may impose a  surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in  lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\" To  me, it\\'s very simple: One price for everything.</p><p> You walk in and - forget about -- I don\\'t know where they get the discount  from or that the statute permits that, because what it  says on its -- to me, on its plain terms is one price.\\n \\n\\n And you told Justice Breyer that that was okay.\\n\\n\\n\\n Certainly would be -- I\\'m hard-pressed to see if that\\'s\\n\\n the interpretation given to what I view as the plain\\n\\n meaning of the statute, that that would be\\n\\n unconstitutional.</p><p> And you tell me that  that\\'s what the State is going to tell me, that if they  post credit card price ., cash price $, that if the  cash -- if the person comes to the cashier and gives  them a credit card, the cashier is going to say, you  know you\\'re paying a surcharge of  cents; you\\'re  going -- you\\'re going to be prosecuted for that?</p><p> Well, this is a really\\n\\n nice agreement, except the State below had two different\\n\\n interpretations.</p><p> New York didn\\'t.</p><p> I\\'m saying if we say  it\\'s okay. I know you\\'re not claiming it is.\\n \\n56</p><p> But you\\'re saying more  than this. You\\'re saying this is how they advertise it,  but that there\\'s a further disclosure law that when a  customer calls up the gas station, the gas station can\\'t  do any one of these four things and potentially other  things, too; right?</p><p> So they hold this in an  as-applied a challenge -- I hope your adversary will  confirm this -- that they want to do these four things  that\\'s in the reply brief, one or the other. If we say  these are okay, whatever else the law means we\\'re not  reaching because this is an as-applied challenge. If - if we say they\\'re okay or the New York State court of  appeals say it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay; right?</p><p> There is nothing about\\n\\n the scheme that addresses that. The scheme has no\\n\\n disclosure requirement of what was your actual credit\\n\\n card charge versus what you\\'re charging. The scheme\\n\\n does nothing to help that situation.</p><p> I\\'m sorry.</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.  The case is submitted.

Mr. Bergeron, you have four minutes\\n \\n\\n remaining.\\n\\n48\\n\\n REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Well, I'm not sure  you would call it -- it's not a typical finding of fact  to say that based on all of the, you know, issues in  terms -- I think the parties would have settled. I find  it more likely than not. I mean, it has factual  elements, but it's much more of a judgment determination  than simply this is what happened or this is what would  happen.</p><p> Well, and -- and\\n \\n40  it's hard for me to see how the district court would be  in a position, except perhaps in an extraordinary case  to -- to make the calculation, oh, the parties would  have settled this. I mean, you're involved in this;  your friend on the other side is. You know, discussions  about whether to settle the case and a lot of different  things go into that calculation, and sometimes they - they line up and sometimes they don't.  But for the district court to -- to make  that determination, it seems to me that that would be a  very hard calculation. I mean, things like the extent  to which your clients need the money, the extent to  which your clients -- what their expectations were, what  their stomach for going on with more years of litigation  is, I don't know how a district court factors in all  those considerations.</p><p> Well, but you say it  was a sham, but I -- and maybe you disagree, but  Goodyear in its -- in its reply brief, details the  good-faith defenses it had that were unrelated to the  Heat Rise test; in other words, about the cause of the  accident, whether other parties were involved, that the  tire was already damaged, the -- you know, all sorts of  other things, including ones that went to the question  of damages, which surely would have been pertinent in  whether the case would have settled.</p><p> Well, I -- I suppose\\n\\n the idea would be that in an opinion, we would provide\\n\\n greater guidance on exactly what type of analysis is to\\n\\n be applied. And if the district court wants to go ahead\\n\\n \\n\\n and say, well, that's exactly what I did, well, then\\n\\n38\\n\\n they -- they can take the case from there. But I mean,\\n\\n simply because -- and -- and as I look at the\\n\\n calculation, I understand why the 700,000 would be\\n\\n carved out, but I don't think it can be regarded as the\\n\\n application of proximate cause across the board.</p><p> Which was not --\\n\\n not -- the Ninth Circuit did not rely on the waiver\\n\\n argument.</p><p> Oh. So your waiver\\n\\n argument.</p><p> Well, but I'm not\\n\\n sure that she, in calculating the $700,000, applied an\\n\\n appropriate proximate cause analysis. I mean, those are\\n\\n things like the other defendants and all of that. I\\n\\n mean, I'm not sure that unless you accept the idea -- I\\n\\n understand your argument, well, it would have settled\\n\\n and, therefore, every -- every expense was caused. It\\n\\n seems to me that saying the only ones that were\\n\\n proximately caused -- that were not proximately caused\\n\\n were the $700,000 is a bit of a stretch.</p><p> Judge Watford - Judge Watford disagrees with your reading of the  majority, right?</p><p> Well, is that the  standard? It could be possible?</p><p> Well, but I mean  the -- as I understand it, the allegations with respect  to the other defendants did not have relationship to the  Heat Rise test, and if -- if -- or -- if that's the  case, you're saying well, we would have gotten enough  money from Goodyear; we wouldn't have cared about the  money from the others?</p><p> How does it -- what  is the causation link between their misconduct and the  fees incurred with respect to other defendants?</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Egbert.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. EGBERT  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS</p><p> Well, let's say\\n\\n they're not.

We\\n\\n don't need to worry about, you know, this less\\n\\n compelling test.</p><p> -- dramatic or  compelling.</p><p> Well, your test is  the direct directness of the causation. And I -- I  guess I'm curious as to how you would apply that in  practice. I mean, if you take a case, for example, they  don't get the Heat Rise test, they get something else  that isn't as, in their view -</p><p> We'll hear argument  next in case -1406 Goodyear v.

Is that something that would be\\n\\n directly caused by the failure to disclose the Heat Rise\\n\\n test?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>Well, if you're not -- and\\n\\n I -- I thought you admitted earlier that it wouldn't be\\n\\n appropriate for us to say that could never happen, or\\n\\n maybe I misunderstood your answer.\\n\\n But suppose we think that there could be\\n\\n circumstances in which a court could say this would have\\n\\n settled based on the fatal nature of the disclosure.\\n\\n This would have settled sooner, had it been properly\\n\\n disclosed. You would have to fall back on a rule that\\n\\n says this is never -- it -- although a court is\\n\\n sometimes permitted to do this, legal rule has to be it\\n\\n has to be done only in the clearest of cases or\\n\\n something like that.</p><p> I think it's pretty easy to\\n \\n\\n think of hypotheticals and how they might be\\n\\n\\n\\n unrealistic, in which the eventual disclosure of some\\n\\n piece of information that should have been disclosed a\\n\\n lot earlier is so fatal to the defense that the case\\n\\n would be settled as soon as that came to light.\\n\\n You think it's impossible to imagine\\n\\n something like that? Suppose there were some internal\\n\\n Goodyear document here that said, you know, we are going\\n\\n to sell this. We are going to market this to RVs, but\\n\\n we know it's really not suitable for RVs. And so if\\n\\n people put it on an RV and they are driving around in a\\n\\n hot climate, the tire is going to explode.\\n\\n I mean, if you had an internal document like\\n\\n that, it wouldn't be very hard to say, wow, once this\\n\\n comes out, we are going to have no option but to settle\\n\\n the issue of liability.</p><p> The Ninth Circuit did not  hold that there was a waiver, did it?</p><p> I didn't read the -- the\\n\\n Ninth Circuit opinion that way. I'm looking at page 32A\\n\\n of the appendix of the petition. The Ninth Circuit\\n\\n reads Chambers to mean that all attorneys' fees may be\\n\\n awarded once the sanctionees begin to flout their clear\\n\\n discovery obligations and engage in frequent and severe\\n\\n abuses of the judicial system, and then it goes on to\\n\\n say that -- that the district court -- that there\\n\\n wasn't -- that the Supreme Court expressly rejected the\\n\\n linkage argument made by the sanctionees.\\n\\n So that doesn't seem to me to be accepting\\n\\n any kind of causation requirement; rather, to say where\\n\\n you've got very frequent and -- and pervasive abuse, you\\n\\n get everything.</p><p> You -- you just said, I\\n\\n thought, that the Ninth Circuit accepted a causation\\n\\n requirement. Did you just say that?</p><p> What does that mean? Is  that different from saying that it caused everything?  To say that it permeated everything, is that the same  thing as saying that it -- it caused everything?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Maybe we don\\'t have to. I\\n\\n mean, you -- but I have, she said -- the key words here,\\n\\n the district court said is, she said the case is more\\n\\n likely -- more likely than not would have settled much\\n\\n earlier. When? Then she says, but, of course, the\\n\\n evidence might have made plaintiffs realize they had a\\n\\n winning trial and they would have refused to settle.</p><p> She did say more than not.\\n\\n She did say more -- this case, more likely than not,\\n\\n would have settled much earlier. And you\\'ll be arguing\\n\\n about she used the wrong word earlier. They are not\\n\\n arguing about that apparently.\\n\\n So more likely than not, it would have\\n\\n settled. Therefore costs that do, in fact, flow from\\n\\n the fact that it didn\\'t settle are costs that you have\\n\\n \\n\\n to pay. It sounds like a causation standard.\\n\\n51</p><p> You make that an issue\\n\\n below?</p><p> And the one key thing, all  of that, we know there has been sham litigation in the  world. And she says maybe the plaintiffs wouldn\\'t have  settled. Who knows? You probably know. But who knows?  And the key word she leaves out, and there  is some evidence she thought she was doing something  different -- namely, the 700,000 -- is that she applied  a proximate cause standard. She doesn\\'t say she\\'s doing  that. There is some indication to the contrary.  So to be -- I\\'d just repeat myself that we  don\\'t have to decide all those things but for the  standard. And you go back to the Ninth Circuit, one  extra proceeding, and then you make your -- your  argument right there exactly what you\\'re saying and say,  well, she did apply the right standard. And even if she  didn\\'t, we lose the 700,000.</p><p> That\\'s the question, then.  That\\'s the legal question. It\\'s very suitable for us.  If, in fact, it is the case that a district court would\\n \\n46  not have awarded $ or  million, whatever it is, this  amount, it would have found no causation or would not  have found causation and would not have awarded the fee  but for the fact it was absolutely egregious, does that  permit the district court to award the fee?  Now, that is a pure legal question. And  where -- where do you stand on that? I mean, that, it  seems, on the basis of the precedent -- Rule , the  mineworkers, and so forth -- the answer to that question  is no, unless you\\'re going to criminal proceedings.  Now, where do you stand on that?</p><p> What?</p><p> No, but I\\'ve asked the  question. I haven\\'t -- I mean, which side?</p><p> But why? Why get into \\n\\n different meanings of \"cause\" in the law? I mean,\\n\\n proximate cause is normally defined as a but-for\\n\\n condition and foreseeable.</p><p> And if we start having --\\n\\n why should we have some other definition here?</p><p> Why don\\'t we just say,\\n\\n look, there\\'s an argument here and you look at what the\\n\\n district court said. She didn\\'t say really that I\\'m\\n\\n going to look and see if there\\'s but for and\\n\\n foreseeability. And, moreover, she said cause and then\\n\\n she said, well, maybe it\\'s not.\\n\\n So it\\'s sort of ambiguous what she did.\\n\\n Send it back to the Ninth Circuit, say it\\'s proximate\\n\\n cause, that\\'s the test, you apply it. Did she do it?\\n\\n If not, send it back to her. Good-bye.</p><p> Okay.</p><p> Can we go back to the Ninth\\n\\n Circuit, too?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Wasn't, that wasn't that\\n\\n what was found here was that it was pervasive from the\\n\\n very first effort to get discovery continuing through\\n\\n the settlement?</p><p> But weren't you given the  opportunity -- maybe you can clarify this -- the -- the  Court said, well, if we're wrong about giving all of the  counsel fees, then we will deduct -- what? -- some  $700,000 based on Goodyear's filing of the amount that  should not be recovered because it was unrelated to  Goodyear's bad conduct.</p><p> And you represented that  that was the cost that was not attributable to  Goodyear's misconduct.</p><p> Well, to be precise about  that, what were you asked by the district judge to  submit?</p><p> So why isn't it  appropriate, given that the plaintiff was put to a great  expense and probably got less in the settlement than  they would have gotten if Goodyear had lived up to its  discovery responsibilities, why isn't it appropriate to\\n \\n  say instead of making the plaintiff prove every single  item that's attributable to the discovery fault, it  should be the defendant's expert to point out what - what items were not attributable?</p><p> What do you -- what do  you do then with the plaintiff's position that this case  would have settled much earlier, which the district  judge accepted?</p><p> What do you do with Judge  Watford who said that that finding that it would have  settled much earlier is not supported by the record?</p><p> But the money -- and this  is an award of counsel fees, so the money would go to  counsel, not the plaintiff?</p><p> That would have happened  even if you had a 100 percent fit tire.</p><p> What about -- what about  Goodrich's argument that the defect in the tire, all of  that was beside the point because the cause of the  accident was road debris? Road debris forced this car  to swerve off the road.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>You said you were going to  respond to Justice Alito\\'s statements from the Ninth  Circuit. I have another one to give you.  I mean, this is the closest, it seems to me,  as to a standard that comes from the Ninth Circuit, that  the district court awarded the amount that the Court  reasonably believed it cost the Haegers to litigate  against a party during the time when that party was  acting in bad faith. So it seems to me that the Ninth  Circuit was viewing this chronologically. When the  party was acting in bad faith, all of those costs are - and fees are appropriate.</p><p> Why -- why did the district  court set two standards, the . and the ., if she  thought that she was bound by causation? I thought that  the -- that the whole idea of those two was, one was, if  I\\'m bound by a causation requirement and one was if I\\'m  not.</p><p> Well, why did she say -</p><p> But -- but, Mr. Bergeron,\\n \\n  you\\'re saying well, you should use a causation test, but  you can\\'t ever consider the likelihood of settlement.  But the likelihood of settlement might be -- might not  be here, but might be in another case, quite relevant to  the question of what fees have been caused by the  misconduct.</p><p> Is it odd that the -</p><p> To go over each, you know,  hour of an attorney\\'s work. We understand the district  courts are going to have to make some broad categories  and some guesstimates. Do you agree with that too?</p><p> You said you wanted to use  the Fox v. Vice standard, and part of that is the  but-for causation inquiry. And part of that is a pretty  clear statement that we don\\'t expect district court  judges to be, you know, green eye-shade accountants, is  I think what we called them.</p><p> But that\\'s not anything like  the full  million?</p><p> So how much is that?</p><p> What costs do you concede  you\\'re responsible for?</p><p> What\\'s the difference  between the  million and the .? What is the $700,000  in there; costs for what?</p><p> So then why hasn\\'t that been\\n\\n done already in the district court? In other words, if\\n\\n you\\'re right, that there is a causation requirement\\n\\n here, we send it back to the district court, hasn\\'t the\\n\\n district court already performed that calculation?</p><p> When the district court gave\\n\\n these two awards, the . and the  million, do you\\n\\n understand that to have been . if I\\'m not bound by a\\n\\n cause requirement;  million if I am?</p><p> Yes, but if a lack of\\n\\n certainty like that is going to prevent a judge from\\n\\n actually making an award, then people on the other side,\\n\\n people who are victimized, are going to be\\n\\n undercompensated in case after case after case.</p><p> Well, I don\\'t know what - what -- too speculative. I mean, the Court says, look,  I understand that I have to find this; you know, that  it\\'s more likely than not. That\\'s how we make findings  about what costs would have been incurred anyway.  Would -- you know, there\\'s never any certainty. We\\'re  always saying more likely than not, would this cost have  been incurred? I think none of the costs of this suit  would have been incurred if this abuse hadn\\'t taken  place.</p><p> Well, suppose we say that  the Fox v. Vice but-for test is something along the  lines of what we should be applying here. So how  does -- in your reply brief, you basically say that a  court can \"never.\" You don\\'t -- you don\\'t just say in  this case it was wrong. In your reply brief, you say a  court can never say, look, the case would have settled  right away, and all costs ought to go to the victimized  party.  Why is that? If it\\'s a but-for test, why  couldn\\'t a court on a proper set of facts say, look, if\\n \\n  this -- if this abuse hadn\\'t occurred, this case would  just never have gone on?</p><p> -- without the misconduct.  But Fox v. Vice never uses this language of  directness, which seems to me actually much more in line  with proximate cause inquiries.  Now, Fox v. Vice, you know, never addressed  proximate cause either way. It wasn\\'t a proximate cause  fact pattern. This actually seems not really a  proximate cause fact pattern either; it just seems as  though it\\'s a -- you know, should there be a but-for  test.  So I guess I\\'m wondering, where does this  language of -- you say \"but for,\" but you also say  \"direct.\" What do you mean when you use those two  terms?</p><p> It\\'s would you have incurred\\n  this cost anyway even -</p><p> Mr. Bergeron, could I go\\n \\n  back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you.  You said that you favored the approach of Fox v. Vice,  which is a but-for test.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>In other words, the more  egregious the -- the -- the violation the harder it is  to show causation.

Suppose there were a criminal\\n\\n statute that says that it is a crime -- it is a felony\\n\\n to charge an unjust rate. And then the -- there was a\\n\\n civil statute that incorporated that, and we would say,\\n\\n well, because you can't make it a felony to charge an --\\n\\n an unjust rate or price. You can't have that in the\\n\\n civil statute. You can't incorporate it into the civil\\n\\n statute.</p><p> How about unlawful entry  into the United States?</p><p> I mean, if that's your\\n\\n answer, it totally ignores that this is not a criminal\\n\\n case. And it certainly is true that deportation has\\n\\n more severe consequences than the typical civil case.\\n\\n But there are many other civil cases that can have a\\n\\n devastating impact on someone, such as child custody,\\n\\n loss of a professional license, complete destruction of\\n\\n a business, loss of the home. Now, assuming that there\\n\\n is some sort of vagueness standard that applies in civil\\n\\n \\n40  cases, I would have thought your answer would be that  it's a sliding scale and that the -- the standard for  civil cases is not the same as the standard for criminal  cases. But how much specificity is required in the  civil context depends on the severity of the  consequences of the case.</p><p> No. That's not exactly the  way the Court -- what the Court said, or at least it's  not necessary to read Jordan that way. I think Jordan  can be read to say, look, the dissent has raised this  new argument, it wasn't briefed, it wasn't argued. The  dissent says this is unconstitutionally vague; we are  going to apply the criminal standard here and it  satisfies the criminal standard. It -- it didn't say  assume for the sake of argument, but I think it can  certainly be read that way. And if you don't read it  that way, you are stuck with a conclusion that a statute  making a crime of moral turpitude punishable by a felony  term of imprisonment would satisfy the vagueness\\n \\n41  standard for a criminal statute, which I think is very  difficult to defend.</p><p> Well, would you say the same  thing if it didn't -- if this statute did not  incorporate a definition that is also used in criminal  statutes and simply had the same standard in a purely  immigration statute? So no reference to a -- a  definition that also applies in criminal cases.</p><p> If the Court -- if the Court  were to hold that (b) is unconstitutionally vague in  criminal cases, what would the impact -- in criminal  cases involving the application of the categorical  approach, what would the -- what would the implications  of that be?</p><p> What would be some of the  most important examples?</p><p> But, I mean, unless you're  willing to say that the criminal statute that I  hypothesized would satisfy vagueness standards, I -- I  don't see how you can say that the same vagueness  standard applies in criminal cases and deportation  cases.</p><p> So why does crime -- then  the statute making a crime of saying anyone who commits  a crime of moral turpitude sentenced to  -- up to   years, that would be -- that would satisfy vagueness for  a criminal statute?</p><p> What -- is DUI a crime of  moral turpitude?</p><p> How about failure to file an  income tax return?</p><p> But that seems to me -- I  mean, I'm surprised by -- somewhat surprised by your  answer. That seems to me to be at least as vague as  (b). And yet the holding in the Jordan case on which  you rely was that that -- that a -- a deportation  statute that permitted deportation for a person  convicted of a crime of moral turpitude satisfied the  applicable vagueness standard there. So -</p><p> Mr. Rosenkranz, could I ask\\n\\n you this: Suppose Congress enacted a statute that said\\n\\n any person who commits a crime of moral turpitude in the\\n\\n District of Columbia or with -- within the special or\\n\\n maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United\\n\\n States shall be imprisoned for not more than  years,\\n\\n would that be unconstitutionally vague?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>What do you think of the  idea suggested in Justice Alito\\'s opinion that the word  \"offense\" like the word \"crime\" both those words are  ambiguous. They can refer either to a category of  behaviors that many people can engage in or they can  refer to this behavior that this defendant engaged in on  this particular instance.  So he said, as I read it, let\\'s back up.  Can\\'t be done. Congress thought both in this statute  and in the other statute, it wouldn\\'t be that tough to  categorize all the State criminal laws by their degree  of risk of violence. Can\\'t be done. Too many State  criminal laws used in too many different ways, too many  different words, no statistics are kept, the Justice  Department can\\'t get them, so we\\'re left guessing. So  let\\'s back up and look at what this person did on this  occasion. What is your reaction to that?</p><p> You\\'d have to have it\\n\\n argued. But I think if you really did that, I just\\n\\n don\\'t know if you thought it through at the SG\\'s office\\n\\n about the pros and cons. And in case -- you needn\\'t\\n\\n have done -- but in case you have done, I\\'d -- I\\'d\\n\\n appreciate your telling us what you all think even if\\n\\n you\\'re not stuck with it. I know that\\'s unusual for you\\n\\n to be stuck with it. I\\'m just curious.</p><p> I -- I see that. The thing  underlying this is -- which is a difficult case -- if we  say you\\'re right, what then do we say about moral  turpitude, unfair competition, just and reasonable  rates, public convenience and necessity, and there are a  hundred others and they\\'re all civil.  Now, what you\\'ve suggested is -- well, what\\n \\n37  you say is this. You say that the Constitution requires  the creation of an administrative agency which will  develop a tradition over time that will clarify, but  will otherwise -- that kind of reasoning was present in  the nondelegation doctrine. So what you want to say is  that which would -- that which would have saved a  statute under the nondelegation doctrine, which is not  fair competition, it\\'s delegation of unriot, but which  is -- gives meaning is also necessary to save a civil  statute from vagueness.  Hmm. That\\'s a very interesting holding.  I\\'d rather read it in a law review article than I would  write those words which will suddenly become real.</p><p> So I\\'m not -- I\\'m not -- do  you see where I\\'m floating on this? I -- I see your  point, it\\'s quite similar, but I quite worry about the  implications.</p><p> I was quoting Cordoza. I\\'m  happy to be confused with him.  (Laughter.)</p><p> What is the principle of\\n\\n law that led to A.B. Small? No one thinks statutory\\n\\n words in the civil context, \"unjust or unreasonable\\n\\n rates,\" whether enforced by courts against railroads, or\\n\\n whether enforced by an agency, is unconstitutional. No\\n\\n one thinks that. A.B. Small holds that, but it holds\\n\\n that in the context of there having been an earlier case\\n\\n that struck those words down in criminal context.\\n\\n So what is the principle of law that it\\n\\n stands for?</p><p> I think you argued it. I  just wanted to know what your reaction is.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>But, Mr. Kneedler, didn\\'t  the government argue in -- when Johnson was before us,  that if the ACCA residual clause was invalid, then (b)  would be vulnerable because it was subject to the same  central objection. Wasn\\'t that the government\\'s  argument?</p><p> The immigration judge  also found that the -- these burglaries qualified as  crimes of moral turpitude. Another ground for removal.  Does -- does burglary qualify as -- as a crime of moral  turpitude?</p><p> That\\'s why this case\\n\\n didn\\'t work under (a) and the elements, right?</p><p> What do you do with  Leocal? I mean, one thing is clear. The Court did say\\n \\n\\n that burglary is the classic crime. It fits within\\n\\n44\\n\\n (b).</p><p> In (b).</p><p> I think it -- wasn\\'t the  word during the \"commission\" of? Is it -- in the course  of or during the commission of?</p><p> But what of the argument  that (b) is more precise? For one thing, it is\\n \\n  limited to in the course of commission of the offense,  and that the offender must be the one who uses the  force. And in addition, it covers use of force against  the victim\\'s property. So it -- it has a specificity  that the ACCA residual clause lacked.</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>And -- and give me a\\n\\n contrast. And by contrast, what that fell under the\\n\\n ACCA residual clause would not fall under (b) because\\n\\n the same thing could not be said.</p><p> But why isn\\'t also\\n\\n \\n\\n possession of a shotgun a classic example of that?</p><p> -- I -- I was very struck by\\n \\n\\n that language, too. And I think it\\'s that language,\\n\\n\\n\\n more than some of the other language you pointed to in\\n\\n its brief, that might suggest that there\\'s some\\n\\n distinction between (b) and -- and the ACCA residual\\n\\n clause.\\n\\n But on the other hand, \"by its nature\" seems\\n\\n to suggest an elements focus, a real elements focus.\\n\\n Look at the elements and ask, given those elements,\\n\\n given the nature of the offense, what\\'s going to happen?\\n\\n But, you know, the elements section of Section  is\\n\\n Section (a). So it can\\'t be all about all elements.\\n\\n So what is that \"by its nature\" doing?</p><p> You know -</p><p> -- what you think separates  the two.</p><p> Or at least I\\'m trying to  find out -</p><p> Well, that\\'s absolutely  true. And that\\'s what gave us trouble in ACCA because  it could culminate in its use, but it didn\\'t have to  culminate in its use.  But then you take a case like burglary, and  you could say the exact same thing about burglary.\\n \\n  Somebody could walk in on a burglary and all of a sudden  there would be a use of force. But a burglary could  happen in such a way that nobody walked in and there  wouldn\\'t be a use of force.  So, again, it just seems as though we\\'re  replicating the same kind of confusions, and there\\'s  nothing that separates the two.</p><p> So why are you so sure that  there would not be the confusion under Section ?</p><p> And the question is why?\\n\\n Temporally, you know, you\\'re possessing a shotgun when\\n\\n you shoot somebody. You can\\'t do it any other way. So\\n\\n \\n  the temporal analysis doesn\\'t work. So what is it about  that example that makes it fall outside of Section ,  whereas you argued it would have fallen inside of ACCA?</p><p> And you say that that would\\n\\n fall outside of Section .</p><p> Well, may I ask,\\n\\n Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was\\n\\n confusing to me because sometimes you\\'re talking about\\n\\n temporal, and sometimes you\\'re talking about functional.\\n\\n And I want to know what you think the real limitation\\n\\n is. So take the example that you use, which is the\\n\\n possession of a shotgun example; right?</p><p> Yes, exactly.</p><p> No. Give me one that would\\n\\n fall under the ACCA residual clause, but -- but -- or\\n\\n where there was confusion as to whether it fell under\\n\\n the residual clause.</p><p> So, Mr. Kneedler, it\\'s\\n\\n absolutely right that the court in Johnson said that\\n\\n those examples compounded the problem. But the\\n\\n essential problem that the court thought existed was the\\n\\n use of the ordinary case analysis. So I\\'m just going to\\n\\n ask you the question that the court asked in Johnson,\\n\\n and I\\'d -- I -- how do we answer this question? This is\\n\\n what the court said in Johnson:\\n\\n \"How does one go about deciding what kind of\\n\\n conduct the ordinary case of a crime involves? A\\n\\n statistical analysis of the State reporter? A survey?\\n\\n Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct? So that\\'s a\\n\\n multiple-choice test. What do we do?</p><p> So can I give you another\\n\\n example just to test how this test works? You say you\\n\\n look to the elements of the -- the offense to see if\\n\\n they give rise to a risk of injury. Do I have that\\n\\n right?</p><p> Well, what\\'s coming here?  The -- you said that the lower courts are all confused,  and there are splits developing. What?</p><p> If I understood what he was  saying, and I won\\'t try to put words in his mouth, but  it was something along the lines that, yes, it\\'s true  that the elements of burglary do not have the use of  force. But if we look back to the historic  understanding of burglary, what we find is a  longstanding concern with exactly that subject. In  other words, that burglary wouldn\\'t have been defined as  it was, wouldn\\'t have been prosecuted as it was, except  for this fear of the use of force. I don\\'t know. And  that\\'s the best I can do with it and he will tell me if  he can do better.</p><p> He says burglary is that.</p><p> Because that is still the\\n\\n \\n\\n same under this statute.</p><p> Anything else? Because this  is really important for me.</p><p> Could -- could I ask, just\\n\\n in thinking through your argument, it would help me to\\n\\n get a few examples.\\n\\n So could you give me three examples, let\\'s\\n\\n \\n  say, if there are in -- if there are those -- that many,  where we struggled under ACCA, but where the answer is  clear under (b), so that I understand what it -- what  kind of distinction you\\'re drawing.</p><p> I\\'m trying to figure out  what our differences are.</p><p> Presumably, the person is  possessing the shotgun when the person kills somebody,  so it\\'s -- temporally, I don\\'t think that that argument  works.</p><p> And go back to possession of  a shotgun, because I\\'m running over in my mind my memory  of the Johnson oral argument where basically the SG\\'s  office made exactly this argument about possession of a  shotgun, how the elements of that offense are understood  to give rise to a significant level of risk.</p><p> So that would fall on -- on\\n\\n the included side? Because I -- I had thought that your\\n\\n brief said something different, but maybe I misread it.</p><p> Okay. How do we do\\n\\n vehicular flight under that example? I\\'m just trying to\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n sort of ground this. And you might be right. I\\'m\\n\\n\\n\\n not -- you know, I\\'m just trying to figure out what the\\n\\n difference is if we look at it that way, because that\\n\\n doesn\\'t sound so different from what we were trying to\\n\\n do in ACCA. In fact, it sounds kind of the same as,\\n\\n honestly.\\n\\n So give me vehicular flight. How does it\\n\\n work?</p><p> Mr. Rosenkranz, I guess I\\n\\n would have thought that your answer would have been\\n\\n different. I guess I would have thought that your\\n\\n answer would have been whatever implications Johnson had\\n\\n for Vagueness Doctrine, it has already had, and that all\\n\\n you are asking us to do is just essentially to say that\\n\\n this statute is no different from the statute that we\\n\\n looked at in Johnson and to write an opinion that\\n\\n basically just repeats Johnson. And whatever\\n\\n implications it\\'s had or it will have, it will have\\n\\n regardless, and this opinion would do nothing more.</p><p> There was something that --\\n\\n that isn\\'t here, Mr. Rosenkranz, and that is a long\\n\\n \\n\\n history of struggling and failing to come up with an\\n\\n\\n\\n interpretation. And I\\'m wondering why you think we\\n\\n don\\'t have that same history. Because I don\\'t think\\n\\n that there\\'s any question that we would not have said\\n\\n what we said in Johnson had Johnson been the first case.\\n\\n Johnson was the umpteenth case, and we had\\n\\n gone back and forth and we had struggled and we couldn\\'t\\n\\n figure out, and -- and here we don\\'t seem to have any of\\n\\n that. It seems as though -- and not only with respect\\n\\n to this Court, but with respect to lower courts -- it\\n\\n seems that everybody is getting along just fine. And\\n\\n much as I can\\'t quite understand what the difference is,\\n\\n there just does seem to be a difference in practice.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Well, of course -- of\\n\\n course, courts and legislatures always have to imagine\\n\\n \\n\\n consequences when they are classifying crimes. They\\n\\n31\\n\\n have to define what burglary is, because they know that\\n\\n in a significant number of cases certain consequences\\n\\n will happen. That -- that's the way the law works.</p><p> But I thought the point  the Chief Justice is underscoring is that if we go -- if  we base the decision on the fact that -- that this is  civil, then you have to come back here for other cases  under -</p><p> Something has to be\\n\\n briefed before we say it's the law?</p><p> Yes.</p><p> I might say, Jordan v.\\n\\n deGeorge, a case from some years ago, is a little more\\n\\n persuasive than I had thought for the Respondent -- for\\n\\n the Respondent here. You could say it's dictum because\\n\\n they didn't really need to reach the issue based on\\n\\n their holding.</p><p> Before your white light\\n\\n goes on, could you address your first argument that the\\n\\n vagueness standard is different here than in -- than in\\n\\n Johnson?</p><p> But you're -- you're  correct. I think that's the way the Johnson court saw\\n \\n\\n it.</p><p> I think that you're quite  right that that was one of the arguments in Johnson that  they said make the statute confusing. It -- it does  seem odd before we look at Johnson that giving examples  makes the statute more vague. It's a -- it's a little  counterintuitive.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>That's if you\\n\\n concentrate on us, but I did read those portions of\\n\\n \\n49  Respondent's brief and the amici brief, and it does seem  like we are going to have a redux Sykes and a redux  James and a redux many of the issues.</p><p> There were some -</p><p> There were some who  argued in the drunken driving test that the minute you  get behind the car, you -- drunk, you're using a lethal  weapon, a car, to inflict injury on others.\\n \\n50</p><p> Didn't win here, but  that argument was still being made in the courts below  and some courts below bought it.</p><p> I thought the Johnson,\\n\\n two features at issue were the fact that we were asking\\n\\n courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there\\n\\n was no way to even think about what that was.\\n\\n Your adversary points out, with burglary, if\\n\\n the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level\\n\\n of risk. If it's at night, there's a different level of\\n\\n risk. The nature of the entry is at question, whether\\n\\n it's forcible or merely walking through an open door\\n\\n uninvited. It may be easier with burglary for lots of\\n\\n reasons, but there -- the level of what -- or what\\n\\n constitutes an ordinary crime was somewhat at the center\\n\\n of Johnson. Why isn't it at the center here?</p><p> I remember the  government arguing in Johnson that most people who are  found with sawed-off shotguns are committing crimes.  Why isn't that a substantial risk of force being used?</p><p> If statistically -- if  statistically -- and I don't remember the statistics  now, but they were very clear then that a huge amount - number of the crimes of possession of a shotgun were - led to criminal activity.</p><p> Well, the use of force  is not necessary for the use of -- for burglary if you  walk in and there's nobody there. You take what you  find.</p><p> So we're now going back  to gut instinct.</p><p> That observation was at\\n\\n \\n\\n a time before the draconian effects of removal and\\n\\n\\n\\n deportation came into effect. We now have lifetime\\n\\n bars, which were rarely or on very limited circumstances\\n\\n imposed previously. We have many more criminal\\n\\n sanctions with harsher sentences now. I think more than\\n\\n anything we have often said that vagueness depends on\\n\\n the gravity of what is at stake. Today what's at stake\\n\\n is a lot more than what was at stake decades ago.</p><p> And there is always the\\n\\n fail safe that the Attorney General in his or her\\n\\n discretion can deny -- can deny anyone the right to stay\\n\\n here.

But the State of\\n\\n Connecticut has a very strong incentive to -- to be\\n\\n solicitous of the interests of the Mohegan tribe because\\n\\n \\n37  the State gets an enormous amount of revenue from this  casino. Isn\\'t that true?</p><p> Why should -- why should\\n\\n a -- a tribal employee driving a limo be entitled to\\n\\n official immunity? You say that the purpose of official\\n\\n immunity is to protect, quote, \"the fearless, vigorous,\\n\\n and effective administration of policies of government,\"\\n\\n but you -- you want to have -- you want to encourage\\n\\n limo drivers on I-95 to be fearless in the way they\\n\\n drive?</p><p> Well, what would happen in\\n \\n  all the 1983 actions or all the Bivens actions if there  was an agreement by the government employee -- employer  to indemnify the individual?</p><p> So you think it was waived.\\n\\n Was that argument? Waived.</p><p> Now, on the facts of this  case, is there any argument in favor of official  immunity? Mr. Clarke is not a member of the tribe.  He\\'s driving a limo on I-95 transporting gamblers and he  rear-ends Mr. Lewis, who is not a member of the tribe.  You think there\\'s any argument in favor of sovereign  immunity for Mr. Clarke under the facts of this case?</p><p> When -- when there is a suit  against an entity like the Port Authority of New York  and New Jersey and the question is whether that is  really a -- a suit -- whether that is a suit against one  of the states and, therefore, subject to sovereign  immunity, we would look to see who would pay the  judgment. So that\\'s Mr. Katyal\\'s argument.  Why wouldn\\'t we do the same -- why should we  not do the same thing when it is against an employee?</p><p> Could a State give greater  immunity to an Indian tribe than is available under  Federal law?</p><p> So the Connecticut supreme  court could do that if it wanted to?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>All right. So --</p><p> Common law under the Indian\\n\\n tribe being a domestic nation.</p><p> -- what -- what is our - our -- we're deciding this as -- as a matter of what?  As a matter of the Federal Constitution, aren't we?</p><p> And so what's the -</p><p> Either they pass a statute  or they have a State law.</p><p> You mean you cannot because  of the State law.</p><p> You cannot.</p><p> Let's take any State. I'm  using that as an example. States have a lot of people  driving, and one goes out on the road and gets into an  auto accident. I thought that you could sue the  individual driver.</p><p> I thought you could sue  some -- but I may have it totally wrong. I thought,  suppose that in Georgia, there was some people who are  drivers for the State and they go out and have an auto\\n \\n30  accident. I thought you could sue the individual. You  can't?</p><p> What -- what do you think  -- maybe you're going to get to this. What do you think  of the official immunity idea that the government puts  forward?</p><p> Do you think the  official -</p><p> So are -- are there states\\n\\n that do allow you to sue somebody who -- who rear-ends\\n\\n you?</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> There is a remedy.</p><p> Well, I heard his argument.\\n\\n I mean, he may not, I don't want to saddle him with\\n\\n this, but common -- Federal common law, sovereign\\n\\n immunity idea, and where a tribe -- let -- so let's look\\n\\n at what the statutes do.\\n\\n And we see every State and the Federal\\n\\n government don't let you bring a suit against the\\n\\n employee and make the employee pay for an automobile\\n\\n accident. Rather, they offer some other remedy.\\n\\n You go against the State, for example, under\\n\\n the Westfall Act, you go against the Federal government,\\n\\n and so by analogy, where the tribe is, in fact, going to\\n\\n pay and also offers a remedy, then, by analogy, that\\n\\n latter part being important then, then, by analogy, the\\n\\n Federal common law should be shaped to reflect.\\n\\n I think that's basically the kind of thought\\n\\n he's -- your opponent here is trying to put in my head.</p><p> Okay. So how do we deal  with this. Every tribe passes this. You say great.  Indemnify everybody. You'll never have to pay because  as soon as you do that, nobody can sue you. And so,  therefore, the tribe is totally immune from the most  ordinary accidents taking place off the reservation, and  the victim of now these missiles being sent out from the  reservation because they run over people and there's no  remedy at all.  Now -- now that -- that seems to me pushing\\n \\n\\n the notion of tribal sovereign immunity off the\\n\\n42\\n\\n reservation into a place where there are just no\\n\\n remedies for victims at all. Now, what is the answer to\\n\\n that?</p><p> But they are all\\n\\n constitutional.</p><p> Indemnification in the\\n\\n Bivens actions, you say oh, those are constitutional\\n\\n actions. I thought 1983 says violation of the law of\\n\\n the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p><p> And then they changed that  through legislation.</p><p> Okay. But here what we  have is there is no remedy against the tribe. And  that's why I thought it would be odd to say there's no  remedy at all. And, therefore, the basic principle  seemed to be that you could sue the employee, but not  the State.</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> But my understanding, which  Justice Ginsburg said, is that, basically -- the  Westfall Act is a complicated act, but, basically, if  you're rear-ended by a postal employee, you can sue the  government of the United States. So a person who's the  victim of an accident has recourse.  Now, my guess would be that states do  something similar, because it seems to me very odd that\\n \\n35  if I'm rear-ended or run over by some kind of State car  which has a State driver that there's no remedy at all.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>You said repudiated.\\n\\n They could have said, yeah, the Court got the -- the law\\n\\n right, what -- what it was, but we think the law should\\n\\n be changed, and not necessarily repudiating this Court\\'s\\n\\n reading of what the common law is.</p><p> But we said that was\\n\\n wrong. In Westfall, we said that Barr applies to\\n\\n defamation and kindred torts, not negligent driving.</p><p> The Federal driver never  had common law immunity. It has under the Westfall Act  statutory immunity, but it didn\\'t -- the drivers didn\\'t\\n \\n\\n have common law immunity.\\n\\n47</p><p> The -- the\\n\\n indemnification in other contexts, does somebody --\\n\\n you -- you couldn\\'t have an indemnity agreement that\\n\\n would count, let\\'s say, for diversity of citizenship, it\\n\\n would only be the parties.\\n\\n You couldn\\'t -- the indemnity agreement --\\n\\n the party that indemnifies is not a necessary party\\n\\n under Rule . So we haven\\'t considered the real party\\n\\n in interest to be the one who provides indemnity.</p><p> Is there any -- is there\\n\\n any court that has held that an indemnification\\n\\n agreement, agreement to indemnify the employee, extends\\n\\n sovereign immunity to that employee?</p><p> So Congress could have  enacted a Westfall Act covering tribes, but it didn\\'t.</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Suppose this -- the  driver of the vehicle was not working for the -- for an  Indian tribe, but instead was an employee of a foreign  embassy. In -- in that case, am I right that the  immunity, sovereign immunity, would stop the suit?</p><p> They say it\\'s the same as  if it were federal employee, then you would have the  Westfall Act. If it was a state employee, you would  have the same regime, and the tribe says, \"And we do the  same thing.\" You can sue in our court just as you could  sue in federal court under the Westfall Act - Connecticut court under the Connecticut Act, and you can  sue in our court.</p><p> It was a suggestion in\\n\\n the government\\'s brief that Connecticut might afford\\n\\n some kind of comity.</p><p> And the only suit would  be against the sovereign nation itself.</p><p> You say that employee  would have -</p><p> I -- I suppose everything  was the same except that it was a vehicle belonging to a  foreign embassy driven by an employee of that embassy.</p><p> Are you then giving a\\n \\n  different answer to the one that -- that we just heard?</p><p> But wouldn\\'t --</p><p> -- wouldn\\'t that have\\n\\n been the Connecticut law but for its Westfall\\n\\n Act-type -- I mean, the Westfall Act changed it. Before\\n\\n that, it was my understanding that the employee, the\\n\\n driver, you could bring an individual suit against the\\n\\n driver. That\\'s what the law was under the Westfall v.\\n\\n Erwin decision, and then Congress changed it. But\\n\\n before that, you could bring an individual suit.</p><p> Well, let\\'s go back\\n\\n before there was legislation that changed it.</p><p> But under the ordinary\\n\\n law, the employee was -- you could sue an -- the\\n\\n employee in a personal capacity.</p><p> What did it --</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>Do you think that might have\\n\\n happened here in the court below, in the Connecticut\\n\\n courts, that those two concepts were confused?</p><p> No, right.

It might be true in this case, but it  doesn't have to be true. Another tribe could say, no,\\n \\n\\n we don't feel like stepping in.\\n\\n36</p><p> Is it always the case that  the plaintiff simply gets to choose whether it wants to  proceed in an individual capacity or in an official  capacity, or are there constraints at all on that  choice?</p><p> Well, why shouldn't we? I  mean, you suggest the difference is because this is a  voluntary agreement. But why shouldn't it be the rule  that if the State pays, we should understand it to be a  suit against the State.</p><p> I -- I think you're right,  Mr. Miller. I think we would have to change our law to  say something like that. I'm just asking, like what - why wouldn't that be a sensible rule?</p><p> So those kinds of\\n \\n\\n considerations haven't prevented us from looking to\\n\\n\\n\\n who's ultimately going to pay the bills in the kinds of\\n\\n cases that Justice Alito was talking about.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>-- which is, I think, a\\n\\n \\n33  demeaning professional comment.

That's the  difference.</p><p> But you want to say that  it should be alighted because of -- of the tribe's  indemnification agreement, and you want -- but in effect  what you want us to do is to pass a little Westfall Act  up here.</p><p> Well, I think that's a  difficult proposition, but, again, we need not reach it  here.</p><p> I suppose that's correct.  And I was going to ask you, you responded to an earlier  question and -- and indicated that the State could  expand the immunity of the Indian tribe.

I -- I'm not sure\\n\\n how you can say that they could have used both.\\n\\n But in order to convince the jury to accept\\n\\n the alternative perpetrator theory, wouldn't it have\\n\\n been necessary to convince the jury that Alston and Bard\\n\\n pled guilty and were sentenced to substantial prison\\n\\n sentences for crimes that they didn't participate in at\\n\\n all, and that all of the other witnesses who described\\n\\n this group attack, including at least one who doesn't\\n\\n seem to have the -- the -year-old boy, who doesn't\\n\\n seem to have impeachment evidence, were perjuring\\n\\n \\n\\n themselves on the stand. That -- that's a pretty\\n\\n\\n\\n substantial burden to overcome, isn't it?</p><p> What about the attack that  Mr. Williams described? The McMillan's attack on the  council woman.</p><p> Okay. Could I ask you a  kind of a picky question that relates to the  Watts/Luchie evidence. Part of the argument there is  that only one or two people could fit in the garage, but  I don't see -- why would that be so? If it's big enough\\n \\n\\n for a car, it's big enough for more than one or two\\n\\n\\n\\n people.</p><p> Well, lawyers are used to\\n \\n  arguing in the alternative, but other people are not.  And I -- it's really hard to see how the -- the defense  argument could be: This was -- this crime was committed  by McMillan and another, and a confederate of his; but  if you don't believe that, it was committed by the  group, but I wasn't part of the group.  That's really hard to -- to do that; isn't  it?</p><p> But even so, wouldn't it  still be difficult to explain how Thomas came up with a  theory that would be a complete fabrication. It's not  just a -- wouldn't be just a question that he was  mistaken about things, or he might have exaggerated or  something like that. It would be a complete fabrication  with no obvious motive. Wouldn't that be true?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Is -- was the judge -- the\\n\\n superior court judge who decided the post-trial motions,\\n\\n the Brady motion, the same judge as the judge who\\n\\n presided over --</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>But was the -- was the  name disclosed during the trial?</p><p> Why was his name not  given to the defense?</p><p> Can we go back to your  first, to the -- the two who confessed and testified for  the prosecution. They placed two people that the jury  acquitted in the gang, is that not right?</p><p> So the -- the jury, at  least to that extent, did not believe what these  witnesses said.</p><p> Justice Alito suggested  earlier that a defense counsel might take the position,  there\\'s evidence that indicates McMillan was the one who  did it. But at least my guy didn\\'t, my guy was not part  of any gang. So it\\'s not necessary to say this is it.  I\\'m putting all my marbles on McMillan. The defense  counsel could say, \"McMillan is the most likely, but in  any event my client wasn\\'t there\".</p><p> But we don\\'t know how the  trial would have shaped up and how the jury would have  reacted if the defendants had put on this alternative  theory. You can say well, it probably would have  failed, but the test is only could a jury believe this  scenario. Not would they, but could they.</p><p> Ms. Rice -</p><p> Which one was that?</p><p> In a different - different case, not in this case.</p><p> Would they all have to\\n\\n agree to go this route if they had the information, if\\n\\n it was turn -- turned over as Brady material? Some\\n\\n might still say I\\'d rather go with, not me, maybe them,\\n\\n instead of the alternate perpetrator.</p><p> But would all of the  defendants -- this -- this had what, something like   defense counsel?</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>Well, Mr. Dreeben, of course  that's right because that was the only theory in the  case. And the question is, what would have happened if  the prosecutors had given over this evidence such that  an alternative theory of the case could have been  proposed?  I mean, one of the things that you get when  you read these briefs and when you read the transcripts  is, this was kind of guaranteed to be bad for the  defendants in the sense that, without any alternative  theory, it was -- it was a circular firing squad, and it  was, you know, you should believe the guy who doesn't  incriminate me, but of course you should believe him as  to everybody else. And all ten of these people saying  this, it created the worst of all possible worlds for  the defendants. And I think what they are saying now is  as compared to that, of course we would have run with  this alternative theory and it would have been an -- a  completely different trial.</p><p> Ms. Rice --</p><p> The matter of Eleby that you\\n\\n were talking about, this is what the government says\\n\\n about that, and I just wondered whether, what your\\n\\n reaction was to it. The government responds Eleby was\\n\\n not fabricating evidence, rather she was creating false\\n\\n corroboration for something that was true.</p><p> You're kind Ms. Rice, I  would have said creating false corroboration is  fabricating evidence.</p><p> Well, why wouldn't that have  happened anyway? I mean, even if you had this  alternative-perpetrator theory, there's still a lot of  defendants with a lot of lawyers with -- seems still a  strong incentive to point at the other folks and say it  was them, it wasn't me.</p><p> Mr. Dreeben, can I ask about  the facts of this? And it's a -- it's a similar  question on the other side to the one Justice Alito\\n \\n38  asked about the garage. Just when I sort of think of  the fact it -- it's  o'clock on a Monday, it's on H  Street, a busy thoroughfare. There -- in -- in the  prosecution's view of this there are  or  people  carrying out this pincer movement, as you describe it.  There's an alleyway, but it's backed up by houses on  both sides.  Why is it that in the end, the government's  witnesses were two people who were charged and were  making a deal with the government and who had reasons to  make a deal with the government, a couple of really  drug-addled people and a -year-old boy? I mean, you  would think that in this community there would be so  many people who would see the kind of attack that the  government suggests happened here, and why wasn't that  the case?</p><p> Of course, the prosecutors\\n \\n\\n did not know this, but in the end McMillan commits a\\n\\n44\\n\\n crime very much like this.</p><p> Why does Michelle Roberts,  who has a client who the evidence is quite weak against,  say that she certainly would have run with this  evidence. And she's -- you know, when you read some  aspects of this transcript again, you see that although  the ten lawyers had ten different sets of interests, to  the extent that there is a lead lawyer in this case,  it's Michelle Roberts who was the PDS lawyer, who was a  woman of incredible skill and experience, and says she  clearly would have gone with this evidence.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>You have so much to cover,  I don't want to interrupt, but why, if McMillan was the  perpetrator, would he have been hanging around the  scene? That -- that -- that's really -- concerns me.  Why -- why -- if you commit a murder, you don't hang  around for an hour.</p><p> But it was -- it was -- it  was 30 to 60 minutes later.</p><p> But -- but if you had - you had been asked you would have told the prosecutor at  the time that this is not Brady material, so far as,  McMillan is concerned? That's -- that's the advice you  would have given the prosecutor, don't turn it over.</p><p> Did the government give  nothing at all to the defense about Eleby or did they  just give a truncated file or was there a separate file  they didn't give.</p><p> That wasn't redacted, but  it was on a separate notepad or something.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>So, Mr. Dreeben, why did\\n\\n it take the jury longer?\\n\\n \\n36</p><p> Mr. Dreeben, it's a hard  case about whether it was one or more perpetrators.  More than likely more than one. The question is which  ones. We know they acquit two, the jury, and on two of  them they deliberate longer, and they, I believe, report  not being able to reach a verdict on Overton and Turner.  So something was holding them up with respect to those  two defendants.  If that's the case, why would it take very  little to say that at least with those two defendants,  all of the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence  reasonably could have made a difference?</p><p> I'm sorry go through\\n\\n that one again.</p><p> Mr. Williams could you\\n\\n list for me the legal errors the court made below?</p><p> Did Mr. Thomas ever\\n\\n recant?</p><p> I'm sorry, but I -- I - my greatest difficulty with Mr. McMillan is that clearly  his '92 crime, which was decades after this crime,  suggests a similarity that would have been very potent  at a trial. But the disclosure of this Brady, of  Mr. McMillan, wouldn't have led to the introduction of  that later-committed crime. So what we're left with as  an alternative theory is robberies of two women, neither  of which were in any way identical to this crime. All  of the defendants had crimes of violence and robberies,  so their criminal activity was just as bad, if not worse  in some cases, than Mr. McMillan, why would he have been  a likely source as an alternative perpetrator,  particularly as a sole perpetrator, when he was seen  with at least one other person? He wasn't alone when he  was seen. He was seen with another man. There's no  suggestion that the other man was involved.  So how -- how does he become such a potent  alternative in light of those facts? He's just like the  defendants. He is with another person, so being a  solo -- a solo perpetrator is not a natural conclusion.\\n \\n\\n So how do we get him to be the other person?</p><p> Counselor?</p><p> At the trial, the  witness, Mr. Freeman, indicated that there were two  people acting suspiciously. He raised an objection that  those names had not been disclosed. The prosecutor  explained his reasons for not disclosing the names, and  defense counsel chose to say, I'll get them on the - I'll call the witness and get the names myself, and then  he dropped the ball.  What also occurred was that these -- this - this name was given to him as a -- was given to him and  all defense counsel as a possibility within the  materials that were disclosed, that Mr. McMillan had  been on the scene and no follow-up was done.  How can we say that it was undisclosed or  not made available in light of those record facts?</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': '<p>Well, but the --</p><p> Your -- your point\\n\\n is -- raises my exact concern.

Well, for the Takings Clause.\\n\\n And then once you define it, then you say well, it\\'s\\n\\n fairness and justice for whether there\\'s been a taking.\\n\\n It seems to me that you\\'re just kind of\\n\\n teeing up the definition of property to give you the\\n\\n \\n\\n right answer under the Takings Clause.\\n\\n49</p><p> Thank you, counsel.

Are they legally separate under State  law? They\\'re still shown on the plat as separate lots,  correct?</p><p> Are these lots  actually separate under State law?</p><p> Are there other  aspects in which the two lots are treated separately  that make no difference under your approach?</p><p> So that doesn\\'t make\\n\\n it. It makes no difference under your approach that\\n\\n there were lot lines separating the two lots; right?\\n\\n \\n44</p><p> It makes no\\n\\n difference under your approach that the two lots were\\n\\n taxed separately, does it?</p><p> Well, I would\\n\\n suppose that in my hypothetical, the husband owner on\\n\\n one side and the wife owner on the other side, they can\\n\\n build a common house on the two lots, can\\'t they?</p><p> Does it really - does the whole takings issue really turn on that?</p><p> You\\'ll be -- you\\'ll  be smart enough to say: Okay.

(Laughter.)</p><p> It seems to me\\n \\n53  you\\'re -- you\\'re trying to figure out then what the land  interest is. And usually there\\'s a regular way to do  that, which is you go down to the county office and you  look at what the -- the lines are between your property  and somebody else\\'s or your lot and a different lot.  You don\\'t look to whether one is below and one is above,  or that, and it seems to me that gets into a very  complicated situation when for Federal takings purposes  you\\'re redefining what State law says property is.</p>', 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>So if lots are contiguous,\\n\\n that\\'s the end of the question for you; right?</p><p> And that\\'s a very fine  argument, except for the fact that it\\'s completely  contrary to the reasoning in Palazzolo. Justice  Kennedy\\'s opinion in Palazzolo rejects that. And the  debate between Justice O\\'Connor in concurrence and  Justice Scalia in concurrence is about exactly that.  And you don\\'t even cite Palazzolo in your brief, do you?</p><p> That wouldn\\'t fall under  your regulation?</p><p> Right.</p><p> Right.</p><p> Now, which -</p><p> No.</p><p> What do you mean by they\\n\\n were \"involuntarily merged by government action\"?\\n\\n \\n37</p><p> What -- what about -</p><p> And they say, you know,\\n\\n \\n\\n we\\'re going to -- there\\'s a lot next door, let\\'s buy\\n\\n36\\n\\n that; we can use it as a yard for our children when\\n\\n they\\'re growing up. And then after they\\'re grown, we\\n\\n can sell it, and we\\'ll have some money for retirement.\\n\\n And that\\'s a buildable lot at that time.\\n\\n And then this new regulation is adopted and\\n\\n now the side lot can\\'t be sold at all. And they say:\\n\\n Well, look, you\\'ve taken away this valuable asset we\\n\\n were going to use for our retirement.\\n\\n And the answer is: Well, no, because you\\n\\n could -- you could sell your whole property, and\\n\\n somebody who wants to build a big house could build on\\n\\n that property.\\n\\n And they say: Well, that\\'s fine, but we\\n\\n like our little house. We\\'d like to stay in our little\\n\\n house.\\n\\n Now, what is fair about that situation?</p><p> Well, let me give you this\\n\\n example. A -- it\\'s not that far from this case. A\\n\\n plumber and his wife buy a small lot, but it\\'s a lot on\\n\\n which you can build houses at that time, and they build\\n\\n a modest house.</p><p> If -- if one lot is owned by  a wholly owned corporation or an LLC and the other is  owned by the owner in the owner\\'s own name, are they  considered to be under common ownership under Wisconsin  law?</p><p> Do we know -- do we know  exactly -</p><p> I\\'m sorry.  Do we know exactly how Wisconsin and the  county define \"common ownership\"? For example, if one  lot is owned by an individual in that person\\'s own name,  and then the adjacent lot is owned by a wholly-owned  corporation or LLC, is that considered to be common  ownership? Or if one lot is owned by, let\\'s say, four  siblings and the other one is owned by only three of the  siblings, would that be common ownership?</p><p> That can easily be taken\\n\\n care of by making the rule look to the -- the lots as\\n\\n defined at the time of the acquisition rather than\\n\\n something that was done prior to -- prior to the time\\n\\n when -- when a rule would be -- would be applied. But,\\n\\n you know, it\\'s fine to say that there are all these\\n\\n dimensions and they should be nuanced and who can be\\n\\n opposed to something that\\'s nuanced. But what are we\\n\\n looking for? What are we looking for? We\\'re looking at\\n\\n all these dimensions to determine what? Could you just\\n\\n \\n64  say as precisely as you can what we would -- we should  be looking for in defining what is the property that is  taken using all of the different dimensions that are  relevant in your view?</p><p> And is it the economic  impact on these particular owners or on some category of  hypothetical owners?</p><p> But what if a lot -- but  what if a lot was -- was preserved? What if it was  bought for the purpose of selling it at some point in  the future and/or it was preserved for that purpose so\\n \\n65  that nothing was built on it so that it could readily be  sold?</p><p> Well, why wouldn\\'t they be  determinative? I thought you said it was we look to  legitimate expectations. There, their expectations are  completely frustrated.</p><p> Well, that comes back to\\n \\n66  my -- but -- but you\\'re saying that they have to move.  They can\\'t afford to build a big house here, which is  what everybody wants. They don\\'t want these little  modest houses anymore. They want McMansions. They - they have to move. That\\'s what you\\'re saying.</p><p> Suppose you have lots that  are not contiguous but they\\'re very close to each other.  Now, under your flexible approach with all these\\n \\n\\n different dimensions, are they ruled out as a single\\n\\n63\\n\\n parcel?</p><p> Would it matter to you if it\\n\\n were not possible to build a house that bridged the two\\n\\n lots? Suppose one was at the bottom -- one lot is at\\n\\n \\n47  the bottom of a cliff and the other is at the top of a  cliff. Would that matter to you?</p><p> How can you say that the\\n\\n impact is not -- is categorically not great? If some --\\n\\n somebody buys a lot next to that person\\'s house with the\\n\\n expectation of selling it at some point in the future to\\n\\n meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a\\n\\n \\n50  regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can\\'t  sell it, that there\\'s no hardship there?</p><p> Well, that\\'s fine except  that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put  together, they would have to move away.</p><p> Now, they think that\\'s  irrelevant.</p><p> I thought the -- I thought\\n\\n that what you\\'re saying is we have to look at what\\'s\\n\\n fair and just, and now you say, well, we disregard the\\n\\n situation of -- of the particular people who are\\n\\n involved.</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>What is the -</p><p> I mean, I\\'ve not got beyond  Holmes. Holmes says that a regulatory taking violates  the Constitution unless it\\'s compensated when it goes  too far.</p><p> All right. Now, what you  want us to do is to put some pretty clear lines in that  word \"too far.\"</p><p> Are you saying -- look, of\\n\\n course you look at the lines that the State draws, but\\n\\n that isn\\'t determinative because you want to know the\\n\\n total impact on the person, which may get you to look at\\n\\n nearby property or other things. You want to know how\\n\\n reasonable this regulation that affects it is; you want\\n\\n to know whether he knew when he bought it, and perhaps\\n\\n there are others.\\n\\n Is that basically what you\\'re saying?\\n\\n \\n58  You\\'re not denying that you look at the State\\'s lines.  It\\'s just that they are not determinative?</p><p> Is this right? Just say\\n\\n yes or no, and if it\\'s wrong, I\\'ll figure it out later.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Does that fit in your  three?</p><p> Well, what about adding  here when I look to see the reasonableness of the  regulation. I mean, suppose in Holmes\\' case, the  regulation had said you have to leave columns of a  thousand feet of coal. But every expert said, or  everyone who knew about it, said you don\\'t need more  than 50 feet.</p><p> Yes or no?</p><p> You opinion -- in your\\n\\n opinion, if, in the Holmes case, instead of one person\\n\\n owning the whole 50 acres as one lot, there would have\\n\\n been 50 people who each owned an acre. Now, it looks\\n\\n the same, you know, the columns are in the same place,\\n\\n et cetera, and you\\'re saying that does make a\\n\\n difference.</p><p> -- this may be one of them.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> -- different things make my\\n\\n thinking clearer, and --</p><p> I don\\'t care if it\\'s\\n\\n analogous or not analogous. I\\'m trying to get my\\n\\n thinking clearer, and oddly enough --</p><p> Let me give you -- let me\\n\\n give you an example which might help me. Let\\'s go back\\n\\n to Holmes case. There\\'s a hundred acres. There are 50\\n\\n columns of coal to hold up the -- to hold up the\\n\\n ceiling. That he says is okay. No compensation. But\\n\\n wait. Suppose instead of one people -- one person\\n\\n owning all 50 acres, suppose 50 people each own one\\n\\n acre. And in some cases, the column runs through the\\n\\n acre and some it doesn\\'t. Does that make any\\n\\n difference?</p><p> But what about -- I -- of\\n\\n course, property is property. But we are still dealing\\n\\n with a provision of the Constitution that, in the\\n\\n regulatory area, is designed to prevent takings that\\n\\n hurt somebody unreasonably. It goes too far.\\n\\n So why isn\\'t what you want to look at one\\n\\n more thing to look at? But we might look at others too.\\n\\n We might look, for example, at whether the individual\\n\\n \\n  who bought that property at the time he bought it knew  about this restriction. We might look at how, overall,  he has hurt in any related way. We might look, for  example, at the kind of need that was there, and we  might see two big questions.  I mean, one big question is -- though it\\'s  awfully general -- is, is he being treated unfairly  either because we\\'re forcing on him the whole cost or a  lot of the cost of something that benefits many, many  others, or because we are interfering with  investment-backed expectations.  I mean, as you read the cases it seems to me  there are a set of factors like that. And my problem  with your argument is it wants to take one and then  apply a kind of mechanical test.</p><p> I want your general  reaction.</p><p> Now, see that\\'s -- now  you\\'re not getting my question.  Because my question is: Why look for that?  Is it relevant? Yes. Is it determinative? No. If we  start making determinative rules, developers will take\\n \\n  500 acres. They\\'ll break them down into 500 different  properties, State perhaps aiding in this, 500 different  ones; three of them will be just wetlands, and they\\'ll  say, see, you took my three, when, actually, he started  out with 500, and it wasn\\'t a big deal.  You -- you see the kind of problem? They\\'re  written about in the briefs.</p><p> And that\\'s what I\\'m  objecting to.</p><p> My problem is, I can\\'t  think of just what those lines should be, that -- that,  perhaps, there are many different circumstances in many  different factors.  For example, in your case, I imagined that  what the State was concerned about is they want to  preserve a lake. At the same time, people own some  property around that lake and they used to be able to\\n \\n  build houses. So here\\'s what they say. You can build  one. One. And it doesn\\'t matter if you have six lap  parcels not together or -- one. One is what you can  build because, after all, this Constitution is concerned  about, to paraphrase Justice Warren, protecting people,  not rocks.  And so we look at the people and say, how  does this affect them. And in this case, you have a  case, but there\\'s some factors against you, and the - the Federal Circuit and other opinions of ours have  avoided drawing clear lines.  And you see where I\\'m going. And I just  want your general response.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>And we're told these  merger rules have a long history. Many States have  them.

Well, the subdivision  has occurred with government approval, and the merger  provision has occurred with government approval, saying  that this shouldn't be understood in the case of  substandard lots as independent.</p><p> The usual way, Mr. Groen, or  at least a frequent way in which this comes up is a  developer buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is  split up into 100 one-acre parcels. And let's say ,  one-five, percent of them are on wetlands and can't be  built on. It makes an enormous difference whether we're  going to say that those  percent are independent lots,  because if they are, then the developer comes in and  says you have to pay me for all of that. But if they're  not, the developer is out of luck because it's only   percent of the whole. Isn't that right?</p><p> So the usual way -</p><p> General --</p><p> General --</p><p> May I ask a question. The\\n\\n difference between you and the other folks on that side\\n\\n of the room is that they want to look at reasonable\\n\\n expectations, and State law, in part, defines those\\n\\n reasonable expectations, but they're allowing for the\\n\\n idea that other things might come in as well, and you're\\n\\n \\n\\n saying it's all and only State law.\\n\\n46\\n\\n Now, I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea that\\n\\n preexisting State law really does influence quite a bit\\n\\n your expectations about what property you own and what\\n\\n you can do with it. But still, what's the harm of doing\\n\\n what the government and the county want rather than what\\n\\n you want in terms of saying the analysis should be a\\n\\n little bit more fluent, fluid, sure, State law matters,\\n\\n but maybe other the things matter too in a particular\\n\\n situation.</p><p> Okay.</p><p> But here, if I'm buying  property in this area, I also know that there are these  rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and  how it is that contiguous lots are understood for  purposes of that development potential. So why aren't I  buying subject to those preexisting regulations? In  other words, this is not a regulation that just happened  to me when I was an owner. I'm buying subject to -- and\\n \\n\\n property is a bundle of sticks; we know that, right,\\n\\n\\n\\n first year of law school. And I'm buying, you know,\\n\\n certain metes and bounds, but I'm also buying into a\\n\\n certain set of things about what I can and can't do on\\n\\n the property. So why isn't that perfectly consistent\\n\\n with my reasonable expectations? I'm supposed to know\\n\\n the zoning regulations, and when I buy a house, when I\\n\\n buy a piece of land, I'm buying subject to the\\n\\n preexisting zoning regulations.</p><p> But --</p><p> -- Palazzolo depends on the  buyers having the exact same takings claim as the  sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this  case.  But let me ask you a different -- a  different way around the question, which is, whether you  think reasonable expectations matter at all in your  framework?</p><p> Well, again, I think --</p><p> Because if the Court --</p><p> One of the oddities of your  position is that you seem to be taking half of State  law. In other words, you're saying well, there are  these -- there are these lot lines, and everything has  to depend on the lot lines because they've been legally  approved. But there have been other things in this case  that have been legally approved too, and one of them is\\n \\n\\n this merger provision. And you seem to be saying:\\n\\n\\n\\n Well, we look to State law for the lot lines, but then\\n\\n we ignore State law for the question of when lots are\\n\\n merged.\\n\\n And why should we do that? If we're looking\\n\\n to State law, let's look to State law, the whole ball of\\n\\n wax. In other words, saying: Well, when I buy those\\n\\n two lots, they're really not two lots anymore.\\n\\n According to State law, they are one lot.</p><p> But, Mr. Groen, one of  the -</p><p> Well, I -- I think that\\n\\n you're right, Mr. Groen. It's like the legal\\n\\n recognition of property. But the legal recognition of\\n\\n property has something to do with lot lines, and it also\\n\\n has something to do with when lots are merged, when two\\n\\n lots are merged into one. And why would we ignore that\\n\\n question of merger?</p><p> And what would it take to be\\n\\n formally merged?</p><p> Why?</p><p> If the State can say we\\n\\n don't have to eliminate lot lines. All we have to do is\\n\\n to say the -- the lot lines don't have legal effect for\\n\\n some purposes.</p><p> But that's a very -</p><p> And now the person who has\\n\\n bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to\\n\\n build on them, and your argument would be the exact\\n\\n same.</p><p> -- two preexisting\\n\\n substandard parcels.

One of the\\n\\n things that makes this case odd is that there are family\\n\\n members all around. Both sellers are the same family\\n\\n and the buyers are the -- but if I'm right, your\\n\\n argument would extend in the exact same way to a\\n\\n situation where you have two sellers who are completely\\n\\n independent of each other. Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith have\\n\\n nothing to do with each other. Another buyer comes in,\\n\\n also has no relationship with Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith,\\n\\n and that buyer would be able to make the exact same\\n\\n \\n\\n argument that the Murr family is making in this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n Am I right about your argument?</p><p> Mr. Groen --</p><p> That's a very different  situation. In Palazzolo, all we said was that if the  seller has a takings claim, it's not extinguished just  because the property is transferred; that the buyer  could have the exact same takings claim.

I know there\\'s  only a ten percent difference. But as I understood the  appraisal figures, and are now using estimates, each lot  was worth about 350 and 400,000 separately, for a value  of 750.

Why isn't that like  somebody coming in and saying, I'm not a citizen of  Kentucky?</p><p> No, no, I know.  It's a hypothetical.</p><p> Well, what if  there's a dispute about the shareholder status of the  rights and property issue? There may be rights and  property, but we think you own only 49 percent of the  shares. And the plaintiffs say, no, no, they -- they  own 51 percent, so they have a right in property.

You have to come into our courts, even though\\n\\n you're a sovereign. And we don't want you dragging us\\n\\n into your courts, but you have to come in our courts\\n\\n because someone has raised a claim that is not wholly\\n\\n insubstantial or frivolous. That's a very low standard\\n\\n in that context.</p><p> That's not the\\n\\n outset.

They're just -- you may waive immunity, but is  there a statutory provision that supports what you just  said?</p><p> Well, no. Because you could\\n\\n test -- you could determine jurisdiction under the Bell\\n\\n v. Hood standard, and then you can move to dismiss the\\n\\n complaint under (b)(). And if you're unsuccessful,\\n\\n you could take appeal under the collateral-order\\n\\n doctrine. Why doesn't that serve interest just as well,\\n\\n without producing some of the unfortunate -- arguably\\n\\n unfortunate collateral consequences of labeling this as\\n\\n jurisdictional, among which is the fact that this Court\\n\\n would have to decide all sorts of questions even if they\\n\\n are not contested by the parties?</p><p> I don't -- I don't quite\\n\\n understand that. Why would that not be so? If this\\n\\n immunity is analogous, for example, to absolute -- a\\n\\n category of absolute immunity for a government official\\n\\n or qualified immunity for a government official, those\\n\\n are also immunities from suit; and therefore, under the\\n\\n \\n collateral-order doctrine, an adverse ruling could be\\n\\n\\n\\n appealed.</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>So in your view, on the  Chief Justice's hypothetical, before -- your view is  they move under (b)() right away and they would say\\n \\n you aren't entitled to relief because you only own\\n\\n56\\n\\n 49 percent?</p><p> Do we have to -- can we say\\n\\n that -- can we just say -- can we say, look, I guess we\\n\\n couldn't, but -- but I don't care whether it's (b)()\\n\\n or (b)(). Judge, what you ought to do in such a case\\n\\n is try out right at the beginning of the case if it's at\\n\\n all possible whether you have a basis here, the\\n\\n plaintiff, for getting this foreign country into our\\n\\n courts.</p><p> -- I'm not asking an\\n\\n argumentative question. I don't know.\\n\\n What difference does it make whether you\\n\\n move under (b)() or move under (b)()?</p><p> Okay. So what difference\\n\\n does it make? And here I'm --</p><p> Well, so what? I mean, the  reason you do make that right at the beginning, I have  always thought, was not a mystical thing. It's because  you don't want to haul somebody across the country in  different places when there isn't even diversity  jurisdiction.  Here, though, the reasoning isn't quite the  same. They say, try it out at the beginning whether  there is at least a claim here, real claim, that they  did seize the violation -- they did seize the property,  violation of international law. That way we don't bring  China or someplace all the way over to the United States  and cause all kinds of problems without there really\\n \\n being something. So do it at the beginning, Judge,\\n\\n40\\n\\n don't wait till the end of the case.</p><p> -- that's to determine if\\n\\n there is jurisdiction?</p><p> And you're saying that\\n\\n should be the same here?</p><p> Okay. So if we take --</p><p> Well, I was thinking, I\\n\\n can't get my hands around this case, or my mind around\\n\\n it, because it -- it seems to me it's really about a\\n\\n practical matter. And the practical matter is when\\n\\n should the judge in this kind of case decide whether or\\n\\n \\n not there really is a claim here, a legitimate claim\\n\\n\\n\\n they can win on that falls within the category. Rather\\n\\n like diversity.\\n\\n And the answer is, it's a foreign country,\\n\\n and sovereignty is at issue. Do it as soon as you can\\n\\n in an ordinary case. But if you have something special,\\n\\n maybe you can't. Judge, you run your own trial, but\\n\\n keep that in mind. We don't want to have foreign\\n\\n countries in our courts when there isn't really a -- a\\n\\n pretty good case against them, and maybe a winning case.\\n\\n So decide this thing quickly, decide it up\\n\\n front. But to start talking about jurisdiction and\\n\\n these things, I can't really understand as well as, say,\\n\\n Justice Ginsburg, who taught jurisdiction. And -- and\\n\\n I -- why are we in this? Why don't we just give them\\n\\n that practical advice?</p><p> You're -- actually, I'm\\n\\n getting pushed the other way. I came in on your side,\\n\\n but I swing back and forth.</p><p> But this is what's really  bothering me: It sounds, the more I hear you speak,  that there isn't a good thing that we're going to write  in this case that isn't going to get everybody good and  mixed up, because it reminds me of a case where we set a  kind of order of battle, as first you have to decide the  jurisdiction, and then you decide this. And I've never  received so much criticism from the district judges as  for that case.</p><p> Because they tell us that  cases differ a lot one from the other. Let us do what's  practical in the circumstances.  There are three kinds of issues that can  come up. There's a set of facts. Those facts might be  in dispute. If you find one way, there is the  jurisdiction. Find the other way, there isn't.  There is a second kind of issue: that we  take the facts as given. Do they, in fact, fall within  the definition of this statute? And that can even exist  in a diversity case. Somebody's from Guam or  somebody -- you know, that's the kind of -- does it  really fall within, or is it just possible that it falls  within Federal law arising under diversity or this?  And then there's the third kind of case:\\n \\n  Are you so far out that it isn't even hopeful that you  could get into the court on this?  Now, if you take the third, which is where  we are, you leave it up to the district judge to decide  the other two when and if it's most suitable in the  case. If you don't, I'm worried.</p><p> I don't know that that's a\\n \\n39  different issue, I think. Suppose in a diversity case,  A says, I'm from Kentucky. And B says -- and he says B  is from Illinois. B files an answer: No, I'm from  Kentucky. No diversity.  Doesn't the judge normally make that  determination right then and there?</p><p> Well, then why should it be  any different here?</p><p> Because you are, in fact,  asserting jurisdiction over somebody who's from Guam.  Because, in fact, you'd have to go into the birth  conditions and all kinds of things. The judge wants to  put that off for a while because of other things that  might dispose of the case.</p><p> Okay. And --</p><p> When?</p><p> So how does it work with  diversity? We have a complaint; Petitioner or  plaintiff, I'm from Kentucky. Plaintiff, my defendant  is from Illinois. Okay? Filed. Response: Hey, I'm  not from Illinois. I'm from Kentucky too.  All right. How does the judge -- what does  the judge do?</p><p> When?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Tell us when the\\n\\n government arrives at this position, because you know we\\n\\n have an amicus brief, people.</p><p> Jurisdiction in the case  of Bank Markazi. When the court issued its decision in  that case, Iran filed a suit against the United States  in the World Court.</p><p> Then can you -</p><p> Then can you -- I read  the dark green brief. It states a strong case in  opposition to the position you're presenting by people  who were once part of the government. So I would like\\n \\n30  to know when the position that you're now taking, when  did that become the government's position?</p><p> And we did -- we -- we  did say -- I forgot the name of the case -- that if  there's a (b)() question and a (b)(), and you  think the (b)() is easy, you still have to decide the  (b)() first. So you can't substitute the (b)() as  the -- has a claim been stated for (b)(). You have  to have the jurisdiction decided first.</p><p> What about Verlinden?  They cite that many times.</p><p> Is it the standard that  is -- is not this peculiar to 1331. It is the general  standard for how you determine whether you have -- you  pass the (b)() threshold.</p><p> The question is what is  the standard?</p><p> Under the low Bell v.\\n\\n Hood standard, as far as I know, and I think they would\\n\\n be -- bears this out, it's not just 1331. That's the\\n\\n general rule, that to get into court -- just to get your\\n\\n toe in the door, all you have to do is -- you don't have\\n\\n to show that you have stated a claim at that point. You\\n\\n just have to meet the threshold jurisdictional standard.\\n\\n It's -- it's just very strange. Putting\\n\\n together everything you said, what I come out with is in\\n\\n \\n  order to have jurisdiction, you have to prevail on the  merits, which is a -- a facts dispute. They get  front-loaded, too. So everything is decided under the  jurisdictional head.</p><p> What if the Court has to\\n\\n \\n decide whether it has jurisdiction?</p><p> Wait. Where does it say  that in the text of the statute?</p><p> I was --</p><p> And how did -- and how\\n\\n would that differ from a (b)() inquiry?</p><p> I think -- I think what\\n\\n you have described sounds to me like the (b)()\\n\\n standard, that is have you stated a claim that would\\n\\n entitle you to relief under this statute. So to the\\n\\n extent that I comprehend your position, it's -- there's\\n\\n no counterpart to (b)(). There's no discrete\\n\\n (b)(), (b)() standard.

Could you -- in this\\n\\n case, what would be the first question that would be the\\n\\n threshold question as to a right in property, and what\\n\\n would be the question that would get diverted to the\\n\\n merit stage?</p><p> Yeah, but they --</p><p> And you say that for the\\n\\n commercial nexus, right?</p><p> So what is the difference?</p><p> In other words, you\\'re\\n\\n saying the commercial nexus language, you have to\\n\\n establish the fact early on --</p><p> -- at the jurisdictional\\n\\n phrase because of the way that\\'s written in the statute.</p><p> And what\\'s the question that\\n\\n would be answered at the merit stage?</p><p> Because it doesn\\'t have the\\n\\n language.</p><p> Your response to Justice\\n\\n Breyer suggests that it\\'s not only a question of legal\\n\\n sufficiency -- and I think that the government\\n\\n specifically says this in its brief --</p><p> -- that you would also have\\n\\n a factual -- any factual disputes addressed at that\\n\\n time. So if there are factual disputes, you know,\\n\\n there\\'s -- there\\'s a pleading. It\\'s -- it is legally\\n\\n sufficient, but a defendant can come in and say, well,\\n\\n it might be legally sufficient, but the facts are just\\n\\n wrong.

If you\\'re right\\n\\n that the question of whether there is a right in\\n\\n property is decided at the jurisdictional stage, both\\n\\n law and fact, and if you are right that the question of\\n\\n whether that right in property has been taken in\\n\\n violation of international law is also decided, both law\\n\\n and fact, at the jurisdictional stage, then what is the\\n\\n issue, the in issue, that\\'s left for the merits?</p><p> And if I could go back to  Justice Breyer\\'s question. I hate to ask you to repeat  yourself, but if I could understand your -- your view of  why it matters, is one (b)() motions, it\\'s -- it\\'s  not clear whether one can waive defenses? And what  else?</p><p> Ms. Carroll, I -- though I\\n\\n have a good deal of sympathy with the way you read the\\n\\n language, but it does seem to me it gets you into one\\n\\n big problem.\\n\\n So, you know, take a case where there is an\\n\\n arguable claim that there\\'s been a violation of\\n\\n international law, so you would satisfy the Bell v. Hood\\n\\n standard, but then the actual claim that\\'s being made is\\n\\n just a straight conversion claim. So you\\'ve -- you\\'ve\\n\\n gotten to the merits, but in the merits stage all you\\'re\\n\\n talking about is this conversion claim. And so you\\n\\n could be adjudicated guilty even though nobody has\\n\\n decided, in fact, whether you violated international\\n\\n law. And that seems as though it cannot be right.</p><p> Do you -- sorry, I\\'m sorry.</p><p> I see. So you think that\\'s  necessarily a merits issue.</p><p> Well, the section -- I mean,  the question here is -- that seems right. The question  is whether a sovereign is entitled to immunity, and I  guess I -- I would ask you to look at the statute, and  to try to explain to me your reading of the language in  the statute. So the statute says \"a foreign state shall  not be immune... in any case... in which rights in  property taken in violation of international law are in  issue.\" Right?\\n \\n  Now, it seems to me that you are reading  this statute as if it said that a foreign state shall  not be immune in any case in which rights and property  have been taken in violation of international law. In  other words, you\\'re taking out the \"are in issue\"  language and suggesting that the question at the  threshold is -- is -- is whether the rights and  property, in fact, have been taken, rather than whether  they are in dispute.</p><p> Well, what -- what is left  to be in issue, if you\\'ve already decided that there is  a right on property and it has -- and that it has been  taken in violation of international law?</p><p> I think I\\'m just -- I\\'m just  missing what -- and maybe I\\'m just missing it. But  this -- it seems it\\'s a funny way of writing this if  you\\'re right. If you\\'re right, Congress should just  have said, well, a foreign State shall not be immune in  any case in which there\\'s a right in property taken - that has been taken in violation of international law.  What is the \"are in issue\" language doing,  except to say that the inquiry is whether there is a  dispute about whether there\\'s a violation of  international law?</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>I take it there will be  instances, or there could be instances in which the  court finds that there is jurisdiction, that there is no  immunity, and then as the case develops in the fact  finding stages that, you know, I've made a mistake;  there's immunity here. That could happen.</p><p> In my -- my hypothetical,  it is raised; the judge rules against it, and especially  in a case like this where there's, I think, a foreign  subsidiary that's incorporated in domestic - domestically in Venezuela, then there might be questions  of the extent of overlapping management and so forth.  It seems to me that that might -- if there's an initial  finding of no immunity, the judge might, in the course  of hearing the case on the merits that, you know, really\\n \\n there's immunity here. That's -- that's possible.</p><p> This is the opposite,\\n\\n where they didn't know.</p><p> Is there a difference in\\n\\n expropriation and conversion?</p><p> Well, it's always a little  difficult for one party to tell the other party it  doesn't really know its best interests, which is what  you're saying. And -- but -- but isn't, part of it is  Venezuela said, we don't want to be labeled as violator  of international law?</p><p> Can you just finish?\\n\\n Expropriation is different because?</p><p> Are you saying that\\n\\n immunity issues are not generally jurisdictional?</p><p> Immunity issues generally\\n\\n are jurisdictional, are they not?</p><p> Because there's extreme\\n\\n sensitivity with reference to suing foreign sovereigns.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>Let's go back to Justice\\n\\n Alito's question.\\n\\n Why I'm confused by this case is I think\\n\\n both the State Department and your adversary are upset\\n\\n that the court found that there was a viable legal\\n\\n argument that a parent could have property interests in\\n\\n the -- in the possessions of a subsidiary.\\n\\n Is that your understanding?</p><p> I agree.</p><p> I understand.</p><p> I'm asking a different\\n\\n question.

What more do  you want? I mean, it seems as if you're asking us for  an advisory opinion of what the Court's next step should  be with respect to what issues of discovery it should  have on other legal issues, not on this one. It's  already ruled that this complaint is sufficient as a  matter of law, that this parent, under international  law -- I'm not even questioning whether it's right or  wrong.

And the\\n\\n only basis for rejecting everything that you might\\n\\n possibly get was your request -- if you read the order\\n\\n that way, was your request that it be -- that it be\\n\\n rejected with prejudice.</p><p> Well, it's one thing when a  party who suffered a very serious adverse ruling on an  interlocutory order says: Okay, we give up; go ahead  and enter judgment for the other side. That's one\\n \\n\\n thing.\\n\\n45\\n\\n It's quite another thing, possibly, when the\\n\\n party that has suffered this ruling moves for a\\n\\n voluntary dismissal. An order cannot be final unless it\\n\\n defeats every thing that you asked for. So any\\n\\n possibility that you would get attorney's fees or an\\n\\n incentive award or anything else, if that -- if you are\\n\\n keeping that still on the table, if that is still on the\\n\\n table, then the order isn't final --</p><p> Well, that's a different  question. But -- and you've spoken a lot about Ninth  Circuit precedent.  But what is your best support in any case  from this Court for the proposition that a voluntary  conditional dismissal with prejudice is a final  decision?</p><p> Well, how would that be  consistent with the -- the reasoning of the panel that  decided the case that's before us?</p><p> No. With what I just said.</p><p> Well, tell me what's wrong\\n\\n with that as a matter of first principles.</p><p> It is odd that the panel\\n \\n\\n that decided the case, finally decided the case,\\n\\n\\n\\n apparently thought that this -- there was a proper\\n\\n ground for this to go forward as a class -- as a class\\n\\n action, right?</p><p> Well, they said the class --\\n\\n the class allegations were improperly dismissed.</p><p> Were they not?</p><p> Yeah, okay. Well, let me --\\n\\n let me state it more precisely. The panel -- the -- the\\n\\n final decision of the Ninth Circuit was that there had\\n\\n been an error by the district court regarding --</p><p> -- class action\\n\\n \\n\\n certification.</p><p> No. That -- I -- I\\n\\n understand all that. But what I'm -- I'm getting at is,\\n\\n if this -- if a (f) appeal had been presented to the\\n\\n panel that decided the case that is now before us, can\\n\\n you say that they would have refused to hear the appeal?</p><p> How would that --</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>The defendant, I say, has\\n\\n told the biggest lie anyone has ever told and it\\n\\n violates  statutes. Unfortunately, my client is\\n\\n damaged only to the extent of  cents.</p><p> Can you explain to me just\\n\\n how does it work in an ordinary case? A class action is\\n\\n special in this respect. I bring a class action.</p><p> I would think that was the  normal system.</p><p> It would be the defendant  who moves for summary judgment, and then it will be  entered in his favor. And then the plaintiff, of  course, will have an appeal.</p><p> And then if he just refused\\n\\n to, I don\\'t know what would happen. I guess the\\n\\n plaintiff could go and ask for a mandamus of the trial\\n\\n court to insist that they move for summary judgment.\\n\\n The case is over. How does it work.</p><p> I don\\'t understand how it\\n\\n normally works, which I\\'m sure trial judges must face\\n\\n this all the time. The plaintiff has lost a motion. He\\n\\n has nothing left of his case. He says, Judge, I have\\n\\n nothing really left of my case. They can move for\\n\\n summary judgment or -- and let them move for the\\n\\n defendant. You -- I -- it must be weird if the defendant\\n\\n doesn\\'t. I mean, I can\\'t imagine such a case.\\n\\n But if he didn\\'t, I guess the trial court\\n\\n would say, defendant, move for summary judgment.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> But I\\'d like to bring a\\n\\n class action. All right? Now it\\'s going to be worth\\n\\n it. And the judge says, no, you can\\'t.</p><p> All right. At that point,\\n\\n what is the plaintiff supposed to do? You think the\\n\\n \\n  judge\\'s ruling is wrong? He doesn\\'t want to pursue a  claim that\\'s only going to be worth  cents, because,  of that, he\\'s most likely to get no more than two cents  for the lawyer himself.</p><p> You didn\\'t do that.  You said -- you said you -- a piece of paper I have  here, whether it\\'s a little technical, but it says this  action you moved and would be granted, should be\\n \\n\\n dismissed with prejudice.\\n\\n32\\n\\n Then in the next paragraph you say you\\n\\n intend to appeal. Is that a reservation?</p><p> Is there anything terrible  that would happen if, say, the precedent leaves this  open, and looking to try to simplify procedure, we\\'d\\n \\n50  say: If we take the other side, we leave to people in  your position. Ask the Court of appeals for permission  under F.  Now, sometimes they\\'ll wrongfully deny it.  Well, if they wrongly deny it, here\\'s what you do. Go  litigate your case and lose, or give up and then appeal  that final judgment for them.  Now, there could be a few cases where that  won\\'t work either. But they\\'re likely to be so few and  far between that the simplicity of that and people  knowing what to do is better than having  different  cases in conflict in the different circuits and trying  to figure out what we\\'re trying to figure out now.  What\\'s the answer to what I\\'ve just said?</p><p> Yeah, but the problem is --\\n\\n and it is a problem for you -- that there are other\\n\\n circuits. And other circuits have a different rule. I\\n\\n mean, my law clerk has one here. I guess she got it out\\n\\n of the brief.\\n\\n It says, \"A settlement\" -- let\\'s see. Where\\n\\n are we here? It\\'s wright. It\\'s called Wright. It\\'s\\n\\n from the Eight Circuit, or Fifth, I don\\'t know. It\\n\\n says, \"An expression of intent is not a reservation of a\\n\\n right to appeal.\"\\n\\n So you\\'re in a dilemma. If you say I\\n\\n condition my dismissal upon my later appealing, you run\\n\\n into the case, which happens to be our case rather than\\n\\n the Ninth Circuit\\'s called Lybrand, which says then the\\n\\n judgment isn\\'t final. But if you don\\'t reserve\\n\\n something, you\\'re in the box you\\'re in right now and the\\n\\n case is over. And so you think of this thing called\\n\\n \\n40  \"intent,\" which is perhaps an unknown creature before  you thought of it. I don\\'t know.  And then you say, aha. We\\'re not really  conditionally dismissing, so we\\'re not out for that  reason, but we all are reserving an intent, and  therefore, we get to say that it\\'s final and can appeal  the issue. The Rules Committee, having worried about  yours and similar problems, says here\\'s what we\\'ll do  for you. We\\'ll give you that (f) interlocutory appeal.  Now, why should I not think about the case  just that way?</p><p> How do I know that it\\'s a\\n\\n reservation? There\\'s a lot of case law that says you\\n\\n can\\'t just express a future intent, and we\\'re being\\n\\n technical. It says you have to make a conditional\\n\\n dismissal. We dismiss under the condition that we\\n\\n are -- you know, that we\\'re going to appeal.</p><p> All right. So -- so what  is supposed to happen?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>But -- did -- did it go  back when it went back? Was it litigated as a class  action?</p><p> But they could have. If\\n\\n the rule makers wanted to have these class action\\n\\n decisions go up on appeal as of right, they could have\\n\\n made it, or asked Congress to make it, one of the\\n\\n interlocutory orders that is immediately appealable,\\n\\n like a preliminary injunction.</p><p> But would you have to on  your theory?</p><p> Let me ask you, because  you mentioned Rule . The rule makers went through a  lot of work to figure out what to do with an  interlocutory ruling on class action status. And it  came up with (f). And this device seems to be just a  way to get around (f).  And -- and on your theory, would you at  least, before you go to this voluntary dismissal, have  to try the (f) route?</p><p> So -- but here you  have -- you -- you have the individual claim. You may  say it's not worth a candle, but you -- you have the  individual claim, and that's what you have relinquished  in -- in order to take your appeal.\\n \\n31</p><p> For some reason, that  wasn't a class action.</p><p> -- two cases here -</p><p> And then you have -</p><p> This is a case where  there were two Rule (f) motions, both denied, and  we're talking about the same court of appeals.\\n \\n  Was there any effort when this appeal, the  case that's now before us, to -- to get it to the same  panel? We had three different panels, didn't we, for  the...</p><p> This is -</p><p> Yes.</p><p> And we made one change, I  think, that would be favorable to the plaintiffs; that  is, 1292(b) is double discretion. You have to get  permission from the district court and then again from  the court of appeals. In (f), it's only the court of  appeals. You don't need to get permission from the  district court.</p><p> In that -- that position,  because this Court rejected the death-knell rule. It  may well be a death-knell, but then this Court said no\\n \\n\\n death-knell.</p><p> But in -- in -</p><p> Well -</p><p> You are not embracing\\n\\n that argument.</p><p> You are not --</p><p> But you have just said, I  take it, that, yes, it's the plaintiff's choice. The  plaintiff can ignore (f) and say I'm going to get  myself in a position where I have an appeal of right and  not -- and not invoke through discretion of the court of  appeals. So for any time that a corporation -- that a\\n \\n37  class action is brought against a corporation, (f) is  out the window.</p><p> They -- well, of course.  (f) is about a class action. It's not about an  individual action.</p><p> But the -</p><p> -- but any final  judgment, when it's all over, you can bring up  everything.</p><p> But that had everything  to do with the merits because the argument was secrecy.  If the government's position was, well, if we turn over  the transcript, we've -- we've lost, the whole thing is  about the government secrecy plea. So they were seeking  essentially to review a merits ruling that is rejecting  the secrecy plea.</p><p> But they were ordered  to -- the government was ordered to turn over a grand  jury transcript; right?</p><p> What about Procter &\\n\\n Gamble, which you -- you've cited a number of times in\\n\\n this argument? But I thought that that decision said a\\n\\n plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses a complaint may not\\n\\n appeal that decision.</p><p> Suppose we have a case  before the district court and the only issue, disputed  issue, is a pure question of law and the plaintiff says,  I don't want to bother with asking a district judge to  resolve this question of law. Judge, enter a voluntary  dismissal of my complaint. So the tribunal that will  determine the question of law is the three-judge panel  on the court of appeals and it skipped over the district  court. Your -- your theory would -- would cover that.</p><p> May I ask you something\\n\\n --</p><p> It's over (f) and go\\n\\n right back --</p><p> -- before your time is\\n\\n out about the mechanics of this.\\n\\n So the Ninth Circuit didn't say you were\\n\\n entitled to a class action.

Would that suggest a remand on that  question?</p><p> I guess I read your brief,  so I have largely bought into that assumption. And if  that were true, it does seem to me like you have an  awfully good argument, but it would not be final, then,  under 1291.

The - the -- there will often be situations where parents will  seek relief under the IDEA and then be told early in the  process or whatever -- maybe the school will tell them  we can't do that and here's why. And the parents will  think, okay, so it isn't available. We're not going to  pursue that relief under the IDEA.

It may be a scheme  that they decide, no, the relief we seek is not  available under this. This isn't a case.

In other words, if, in fact -- if  your argument were to be that no, you need both, it  seems to me that would address a lot of the practical  problems. Now, I appreciate the fact that you think, in  this case, both are present -</p><p> I think one of the\\n\\n important things in this type of proceeding is timing,\\n\\n right? I mean, we are talking about a school year, and\\n\\n all this takes time. So the idea that well, when all\\n\\n this ends, you know, who knows, I mean, it gathers a\\n\\n debate about how quickly these things are resolved, then\\n\\n we might bring this.

They really care\\n \\n about education for their child.</p><p> I guess that's  why -- but even if what you say is right, and it makes a  lot of sense, a lawyer advising a client might advise  that, look, this is what you want the school to do so  that you can have a free and appropriate education for  your child. You will have a lot more leverage getting  the school to do that if you also sue them under the ADA  and Section 504, and the school board is sitting there  looking at it and say, gosh, we are not only exposed to  what relief is under the IDEA, but we are going to have  to pay damages. You understand my point?</p><p> So if that's the\\n\\n case, why -- I would suspect that the denial of what is\\n\\n sought under the IDEA for a fair and appropriate public\\n\\n education is something that could well cause emotional\\n\\n distress in -- in most cases. And so is all you're\\n\\n saying is that you have to tack on to an IDEA claim, the\\n\\n claim for damages for emotional distress and then you\\n\\n don't have to exhaust, and so whenever a school district\\n\\n denies an element of an FAPE or a proposed element, they\\n\\n will always face two-track litigation?</p><p> And the second one\\n\\n is, you don't have to exhaust because you're not\\n\\n complaining about the fair and appropriate public\\n\\n education provision. Are those separate arguments or do\\n\\n you have to satisfy both of them?</p><p> I -- I understand\\n\\n you'd be making two arguments. One is that you don't\\n\\n have to exhaust because you're asking for damages, and\\n\\n those aren't available under the IDEA.</p><p> We'll hear argument  first this morning in Case No. -497, Fry v.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>What would happen if the  claim was that the child suffered emotional damages  because of the denial of educational benefits?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>It\\'s not necessarily  awkward. You -- you forgot the words \"before filing the  complaint.\" Damages are something you get when somebody  didn\\'t give you something. But go back in time before  they make that decision. At that point, what you want  is the dog, not the money. Now if that\\'s the truth, you  have to go to the board. Once the board makes clear  they won\\'t give you the dog, at that time you\\'re free to  sue. You\\'ve met any exhaustion requirement because it\\'s  futile. They have made clear they won\\'t.  And this suit has been brought after that  was done. So I don\\'t see how this suit is going to ever\\n \\n get back for exhaustion, because the school has made\\n\\n55\\n\\n clear they won\\'t. So say exhaustion replies to future\\n\\n suits before anything happens, but not after the board\\n\\n makes clear exhaustion replies, but the futility\\n\\n exception also applies. Am I right?</p><p> Here -- here this might\\n\\n \\n46  also be peripheral. I mean, this is a dog for a child  who is not blind so is not subject to the regulations.  They have a teacher who is going around, or a person who  is acting as a guide within the school, and this is, to  that degree, a peripheral matter in respect to the plan,  and, perhaps, at least arguably, more like the librarian  in the school who -- or the person who does beat up  somebody or treat them badly, which could be the subject  but a pretty minor part of an IEP.</p><p> That\\'s true, but --</p><p> -- you could find -- I\\n\\n mean, in -- I have exactly the same question, in a very\\n\\n large number of suits, you know, in a very large number\\n\\n of suits brought -- or controversies -- where a child is\\n\\n seeking a special plan, there is a statute that gives\\n\\n him that right, and it rests -- rests heavily on his\\n\\n \\n getting together or his parents getting together with\\n\\n\\n\\n the school board and trying to work something out that\\n\\n makes sense.\\n\\n Now, it seems to me, as the Chief Justice\\n\\n just said, that if we accept your first argument, not in\\n\\n all cases, but in many cases, where their lawyer wishes\\n\\n to avoid this exhaustion requirement, all he would have\\n\\n to do is wait and then sue, not for putting the child in\\n\\n a private school but rather for emotional suffering.\\n\\n Now, if that argument -- if what I have just\\n\\n said is right, which I think is what was just said by\\n\\n the Chief Justice, that would seem to gut the carefully\\n\\n written procedural system that the IDEA sets up. And\\n\\n that\\'s what is concerning me, and I don\\'t think the word\\n\\n \"relief\" has to be read in the technical way in which\\n\\n you\\'re reading it.</p><p> The answer to me, and I\\n\\n think to the Chief, so far is, so what? Because that\\'s\\n\\n what Congress wanted. Is there any answer other than\\n\\n that?</p><p> That\\'s -- if it\\'s that  simple, if it\\'s that simple, why are we in this  argument? You apply ordinary exhaustion principles.  Under ordinary exhaustion principles, you never have to  exhaust and exhaustion would be futile. Okay? So you  say exhaustion applies, it would be futile, I can\\'t get  what I want, end of the matter. That\\'s -- what is all  this complexity? I had thought that it might be because\\n \\n -- well, you tell me.</p><p> So could I say that? Could\\n\\n I say, very well. What they did here was adopt --\\n\\n well-known, for a hundred years or more -- exception to\\n\\n the exhaustion requirement where exhaustion would be\\n\\n futile?</p><p> Judge, you go back and\\n\\n apply that to this case, end of case. No reason for\\n\\n special law, for prisons, for IDEA, for other things.</p><p> Well, I haven\\'t memorized\\n\\n that. Are they essentially --</p><p> -- what I am saying? If I\\n\\n go to Pierce on administrative law, I look up Davis, I\\n\\n will find some words --</p><p> -- and those are the words?</p><p> So would he have to get a  service dog if in fact it\\'s going to cost him $ million  in damages? And they are talking about before filing  the complaint. All right?  Before filing the complaint, you\\'re already\\n \\n  in negotiation with the board. And you think I\\'m also  entitled to this under this ADA statute, let\\'s file a  complaint and asked for damages. It will be res  judicata or something when I win, and then they\\'ll have  to give me the dog.  And if that is the theory, then -- while it  might work in this case, there are thousands of cases  where parents don\\'t have the money to litigate, where  some do or some don\\'t, where boards are in difficult  problems, and all these very great difficulties in such  cases which are worked out through negotiation won\\'t be.</p><p> I see that. I see this is  what -- where -- where I am. I want a quick reaction  from you, if you can give it.  The problem of deciding against you is not  necessarily in this case, but in other cases where, in  fact, it would be fairly easy by how you write the word  \"damages\" in your complaint to have judges deciding IEPs  without the preliminary negotiation and views of the  school board, which would seriously undercut and hurt  the -- this statute, which is designed to get the  educational plan.  The trouble with deciding it your way is, I  think, exactly what Justice Kagan said: Almost anything  can be written into an educational plan having to do  with the child\\'s day at school. And, therefore, when\\n \\n there is nothing more to it than a claim that the\\n\\n38\\n\\n librarian wrongly kept the dog out of the library -- the\\n\\n school librarian, you wouldn\\'t be able to bring the suit\\n\\n because, after all, you could have written such a\\n\\n thing -- don\\'t keep the dog out of the library -- in the\\n\\n plan. So what to do?\\n\\n Now, I\\'m here thinking in the back of my\\n\\n mind of words that have come up in other cases, like\\n\\n \"gravamen\" of the complaint or -- which we\\'ve had in\\n\\n many cases involving sovereign immunity or all kinds of\\n\\n things, which Holmes and, you know, Frankfurter talked\\n\\n about. What is the gravamen of the complaint?\\n\\n And were we to say, let us look to the\\n\\n gravamen of the complaint, the heart of the complaint,\\n\\n what it\\'s really about. If what it\\'s really about is a\\n\\n significant matter in respect to the IEP, then you do\\n\\n have to exhaust, unless, of course, it\\'s futile. If it\\n\\n is not, you don\\'t; and then let the lower courts decide\\n\\n this one.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>But you could -- you  could have -- you could have, as Justice Kennedy  suggested, gone the IDEA route. You could have asked to  accommodate the dog, and -- and if you had done that,  and you were turned down, could you then switch to the  ADA track, or would you have to, having started under  IDEA, continue on that route?</p><p> And what --\\n\\n Mr. Bagenstos, could you clarify what you are giving up\\n\\n by taking this route, by suing under the ADA and not\\n\\n \\n under the IDEA?</p><p> How much relief -- going  back to what you said before, I think you told me you're  not pressing any relief. So how much relief?</p><p> But what does that say\\n\\n other than it's a recitation of fact? There was an IEP,\\n\\n and it didn't include the dog.</p><p> I thought he simply said  that if you're going the IDEA route, you must pursue it  to the end. But he said, we're not going the ADA route.  We're asking the same thing that we would ask if this  child didn't have an IEP. We are asking for access to  the facilities.</p><p> Mr. Katyal, any relief?  I mean, that -- the -- again, your furthest argument is  that if any relief is available under the IDEA, you must  pursue that route first. But that's exactly what  Congress declined to adopt when it was proposed by the  National School Board Association. So -- so you must be  saying something short of if any relief is available.</p><p> And that claim could be  made by someone who doesn't qualify, who is disabled but  doesn't qualify for ADA because she doesn't have any  learning disability.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>But this goes back to  Justice Ginsburg's point. I mean, the entire point of  the statute and the overruling of our prior case was  Congress saying the fact that the IDEA exists for  schools does not mean that you don't have separate ADA  and Rehabilitation Act claims. And if you bring those  separate kind of claims, which are essentially denial of  access claims to public facilities, and then you're  asking in addition to that for a form of damages that  has nothing to do with what any IDEA officer can  provide, then you can go forward without exhaustion.</p><p> Well, Mr. Katyal, think of\\n\\n it this way: Suppose this girl wanted to go into a\\n\\n public library a couple of times a week and the library\\n\\n said, you can't take your dog here; we're going to just\\n\\n provide you with a librarian who will help you do all\\n\\n the things that your dog otherwise helps you with, and\\n\\n the girl brings a suit.\\n\\n Isn't that suit exactly the suit that she\\n\\n brought, except that instead of a library, it's a\\n\\n school? But that's her -- that's her claim and those\\n\\n are her damages, that she was deprived of access to a\\n\\n public facility in a way that caused her distress and\\n\\n emotional harm.</p><p> I don't understand that,  Mr. Katyal. I mean, you yourself have an example in  your brief of abuse towards a handicapped disabled  student that would result in money damages and maybe  emotional distress, but maybe also the parents took the  kid out of school and -- and is asking for the school\\n \\n47  to -- the private school tuition that they had to incur,  so all kinds of things. But it was -- it was -- it was  not because of anything that the IEP said or didn't say.  It was because there was discrimination on the basis of  disability.  Now, it was in a school, and it could be  remedied by school-type things, like stop discriminating  or abusing against a disabled student. But even you in  your briefs say that doesn't have anything to do with  the IDEA. And so why isn't this the same thing?</p><p> I don't -- discrete  instance. How about if you had a continuing stream of  abuse?</p><p> The IDEA doesn't care about  particular instances but cares about -</p><p> But, Mr. Katyal, are you  suggesting that there is no such thing as continuing  discrimination that happens in a school setting that  actually does not have anything to do with the IEP?</p><p> But as I understand it from  one of Amicus briefs, just to sort of put a fine point  on this. There are close to a million students who are  disabled in some way but who do not get an IEP. So if  there is discrimination or if there is a failure to  provide access to one of those students you don't have  to exhaust the IDEA procedure, do you?</p><p> I'm not sure I understood  the answer to the question. In that case, you would not  send the -- the -- the child to the IDEA officer, would  you?</p><p> Well, it's not available;  you don't get a declaration that the ADA has been  violated or the Rehabilitation Act has been violated  from IDEA officer.</p><p> But the declaration was that  the ADA had been violated.</p><p> 700,000, if I can read what  the -</p><p> What if you had a complaint\\n\\n where the parties did concede that IDEA was not\\n\\n violated, that a FAPE had been provided, but as you\\n\\n looked in the allegations in the complaint, it really\\n\\n seems that there is grounds to think that a FAPE was not\\n\\n \\n  provided and that the IDEA was violated? What do you do  with a complaint that looks like that?</p><p> And I suppose one  understanding of this is we don't have to really deal  with what happens if you only have one, because you're  saying you have both. Is that right?</p><p> But you might be. I mean,\\n\\n and this goes to -- I mean, suppose -- suppose that you\\n\\n weren't alleging a denial of a FAPE, but you were\\n\\n seeking damages that included, you know, I sent my kid\\n\\n to private school. I had to hire a tutor. Damages that\\n\\n you could get from an IDEA officer, but for some reason\\n\\n that didn't have to do with the denial of a FAPE.\\n\\n You're saying that you don't have to exhaust in that\\n\\n context either.</p><p> Now, this -- this case is\\n\\n actually the combination of the two, is what you're\\n\\n saying. So in some ways, you're saying this is the\\n\\n easiest case where both are true. You're neither\\n\\n alleging the denial of a FAPE, nor are you seeking the\\n\\n kinds of damages that an IDEA officer could provide. So\\n\\n it's the intersection of the two theories. But -- but\\n\\n if I understand your argument, either one of those\\n\\n things would mean that you don't have to exhaust. Is\\n\\n that right?</p><p> And that's one argument.  But there is a second argument which says,  you know, putting that aside, the reason why we don't  need to exhaust is because we are not alleging that  we've been denied a fair and appropriate public  education. You know, we are alleging some other denial  or -- or deprivation, but we are not alleging that. We  agree that the school has given us a free appropriate  public education. And that, in itself, as I understand\\n \\n it, would also mean that you don't have to exhaust,\\n\\n\\n\\n right?\\n\\n So it can be one or the other. Is that what\\n\\n you're saying.</p><p> And this takes you back to  the first part of the Chief Justice's question, just so  I can understand the argument, is you're really making  two arguments.  One argument is initially when we filed the  complaint and ever since, we've really only sought  emotional distress damages, and emotional distress  damages are something that can't be given under the  IDEA.</p><p> Could -- could I ask about  that, Mr. Bagenstos?</p><p> But the Plaintiffs here are\\n\\n not suggesting that the IEP was deficient. They are\\n\\n saying the IEP was perfectly efficient. If all you look\\n\\n at are the kinds of educational criteria that IEPs\\n\\n usually look at, then the dog isn't necessary. What the\\n\\n dog is necessary for is things that don't have anything\\n\\n to do with the IEP, is what the plaintiffs say. And\\n\\n after all, that's what they are saying, and that's what\\n\\n they are seeking. And that's what this statute suggests\\n\\n that we ought to look to.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>All you\\'re talking  about -- all you\\'re talking about is artful pleading  then.</p><p> I just want to make sure  of the government\\'s position. Is the position of the  United States that a FAPE cannot include relief for this  sort of problem: Personal assistance during the school  day to accommodate the particular disabilities?</p><p> Well, but it talks about  before filing the complaint.</p><p> Suppose it was -- suppose  it was very clear that most FAPE plans cover precisely  this kind of problem. Same case?</p><p> Suppose -- suppose that  there is a school district and two surrounding school  districts within the same Federal court jurisdiction and  same circuit. Have each been ordered to make\\n \\n  accommodations under FAPE -- under FAPE for a dog? And  then the person in the third school district just sues  under the ADA. Is there an exhaustion problem?</p><p> So it just depends on what  the complaint says?</p><p> But then you\\'re saying  that the artful form of the complaint suffices to  subject the district court to damages that it might  not -- the school district to damages that it might not  otherwise have had to pay.</p><p> But your whole point again  is it depends on what\\'s in the complaint. And the  statute says that before a filing of a civil action, you  have to exhaust. If the statute were written your way,  it would have said at the time you filed a complaint,  the complaint must ask \"only for.\" That\\'s what you\\'re  saying, but that\\'s not what the statute says.</p>', 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>They then talk about all\\n\\n the emotional distress. At that moment, either because\\n\\n of futility, because she can't change the IDEA at a\\n\\n school she no longer attends, the school she is in is\\n\\n already giving her her dog, there is no declaratory\\n\\n relief being sought that her current IDEA is\\n\\n deficient -- forget about the past one -- is deficient.\\n\\n Why in the world, at the moment she filed the complaint,\\n\\n would she have to go back or should have gone to the\\n\\n school earlier? She no longer is seeking anything\\n\\n \\n related to the IDEA facet.\\n\\n42</p><p> The -- and it seeks\\n\\n injunctive relief for the future --</p><p> -- not to be hurt.</p><p> All right.</p><p> With no change of  FAPE -- when -- no other thing is said? It's just, I  want compensatory damages?</p><p> How about no injunctive  relief? Past and future damages for emotional distress?</p><p> Can you tell us what\\n\\n page that's on?</p><p> So let's go to the last\\n\\n argument -- the last question directly, then. Complaint\\n\\n says the FAPE was all wrong; it's hurt my child. And\\n\\n that's the nature of the complaint.</p><p> Mr. Martinez, that begs  the last question that was asked, which is the Payne - you know the Ninth Circuit Payne decision.</p><p> No, I know. The\\n\\n Respondents -- appellants --\\n\\n \\n30</p><p> It doesn't do just that.  It doesn't just look just at the relief. It looks at  the nature of the claims and decides whether they are a  fact claim or not, whether it is seeking a change in a  FAPE or not, in essence in substance. So it's not  looking at it technically as we are asking for relief.  But it's -- it's looking at whether or not a FAPE claim  is the substance of the allegation. You're disagreeing  with the Ninth Circuit approach, presumably.</p><p> Yes, exactly.</p><p> No. What they -- what\\n \\n they are saying is, is the nature of the relief that\\n\\n\\n\\n they are asking for, would it require or necessitate a\\n\\n change in the fact? That's one of the three prongs that\\n\\n they look at.</p><p> I am -- I am so confused\\n\\n by your position. I'm -- I'm -- I'm so horribly\\n\\n confused. What is the purpose of all of this? Throw\\n\\n \\n53  this case out now. Let them go back to school they are  no longer in. They are going to say to the school, give  me money, and what else?</p><p> How about if they just\\n\\n waive all of that and say I want my money?</p><p> Well, it's now -- it's\\n\\n now too late to exhaust, right?</p><p> Mr. Katyal, my problem\\n\\n is, what were they -- is the only argument that you're\\n\\n making is that they are not entitled to their\\n\\n declaratory judgment because they didn't exhaust that?\\n\\n Are they entitled, whether they exhaust it or not, to\\n\\n the ADA claims for monetary compensatory damages for\\n\\n pain and suffering?</p><p> What -- what allegation  says they want reimbursement -</p><p> The school already  admitted that. They let her bring the dog back in. She  just said I don't -- I don't feel welcomed here and  left. So they already got the relief they wanted. They  got an admission by the school that she was entitled to  bring the dog there.</p><p> -- for her schooling, et  cetera?</p><p> When I look at the  claimed harms, which the only allegations besides the  prayer for relief at the end is in response - Respondent's Appellate , 51A through F, every one of  those harms alleged is a component of emotional harm.  Nowhere are they saying she was harmed by having to pay  for -- to pay for a tutoring program, or harmed by her  mother losing her job, which is what your brief was  talking about.  Here, all of the harms alleged are  essentially compensatory emotional harms: A, the denial  of equal access; B, the denial of the use of Wonder; C,  interference to form bonds with other kids; D, denial of  an opportunity to interact with other children. And F  says it very directly: emotional distress and pain,  embarrassment, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss  of enjoyment.  Those are -- every one of these are the  classic damage harms that are compensatory.</p><p> So how does the IDEA  provide compensatory damages for these injuries?</p><p> I know, but I was trying\\n\\n to look for it in the complaint, and I couldn't.</p><p> The Ninth Circuit uses  to evaluate -</p><p> Would you fit into the  Payne three criteria, the Ninth Circuit's three  criteria?</p><p> We are now getting -- we\\n\\n are now going past where I am, okay, or you're going\\n\\n behind what I'm saying but not getting to the point,\\n\\n Mr. Katyal.\\n\\n Maybe, before she changed schools, she might\\n\\n have been entitled to something related to her IDEA, but\\n\\n at the moment this complaint was filed, on its own face,\\n\\n where is it asking for any change, potentially or\\n\\n otherwise, to the IDEA that is no longer in effect?</p><p> They have already said  that.</p><p> -- it's not going to be  very attractive to the Court.\\n \\n61</p><p> Because if what you're  saying is we're going to be on a dual track in every  case -</p><p> -- a lot of hesitation  in this Court, amongst some, maybe even me.</p><p> All right? But your  suggestion is likely to raise -</p><p> -- the nature of your  case.</p><p> The government appears  to suggest that in their brief.</p><p> Does the Court have the  power to stay that until the IDEA claim is exhausted?</p><p> I -- I just gave you a  different hypothetical.</p><p> What happens?</p><p> And you didn't say, as  you conceded now, that you don't want the -- the FAPE  changed. The complaint says they haven't let the  service dog in. It's causing and has caused emotional  distress. We want damages. It's not clear, but you do  want the fact changed.</p><p> How about yours is an  ideal situation. Conceded for the purposes you're  arguing. But how about the mixed complaints, because  that's what has been bothering my colleagues from the  beginning. Okay?  Let's assume that you had brought this case,  not after you had moved her, but while she was still in  the school.</p><p> I really -- I appreciate  -</p><p> Mr. Katyal, you're --\\n\\n you're supposed to look at a complaint as a whole, okay,\\n\\n at the moment it's filed.\\n\\n What's clear in this complaint, because the\\n\\n allegations say it, this is what happened. It didn't\\n\\n have it in the IDEA. We asked them to do it; they\\n\\n didn't do it. They finally agreed to do it, and then\\n\\n we've placed our child in another school.

And I would appreciate it if you would  respond to one of the arguments Ms. Sullivan made toward  the end, which is that if we issue an opinion that  affirms in this case where there were -- which involves  the type -- the greatest degree of bad faith in this - in violating the seal requirement that is really  possible to imagine, that will stand for the principal  in future cases, that even if an instance in which there  was complete bad faith, dismissal is not appropriate.  Or a dismissal is -- can -- can properly be rejected.</p><p> That doesn't sound like a  per se rule, then.</p><p> But that doesn't -</p><p> Well, you have two  arguments: One is that dismissal is mandatory; the  other is that the district court and the court of  appeals applied the wrong standard in determining not to  dismiss here.  As to the first, what would you say about  the case where the disclosure is very limited, seen by  only one person, let's say; it was inadvertent, it was  not done in bad faith, and it causes no harm?

I had the same question.</p><p> But the clients did not  know that.</p><p> On the record, does it show  that they did know it or they didn't know it?</p><p> Not correct. It was a  question. Either they did know it or they didn't know  it. What does the record say about that?</p><p> But on the question of  whether they knew it or not.</p><p> Why did you never ask them  or the lawyer?</p><p> So here we have ambiguity  as respect to that. Could I write an opinion that said  the Lujan factors are some factors? Life is  complicated. There are all kinds of factors, and these  factors affect the basic fairness of the situation,  which is something that judges should look to as well.  Like many, many, many decisions, this is conferred upon  the Supreme -- upon the district court to make a fair  decision in say -- in terms of sanction, in light of the\\n \\n circumstance, to be reviewed by abuse of discretion.</p><p> I don't have to worry about\\n\\n this case; you do.</p><p> And I -- I have to worry\\n\\n about the right standard to write an opinion.</p><p> Once you're there -- I\\n \\n  mean, my thought was the same as Justice Alito's: Vast  range of violations. Some don't hurt really at all.  Some are sort of accidental. Some are certainly not bad  faith and they didn't cause much trouble. Really, why  dismiss the case?  And once you begin to agree with that,  you're into argument . And once you're into argument  , what do you think of the Lujan factors?</p><p> Do you have, just on the\\n\\n top of your head somewhere -- I -- I because I want to\\n\\n read this.</p><p> Okay. Okay.</p><p> You see, I -- I think this\\n\\n is going to protect the government's investigations.\\n\\n But the consequence of this is that there is a document\\n\\n somewhere in the court that says Joe Smith is a\\n\\n defendant in what could be a very harmful case to Joe\\n\\n Smith. If Joe Smith is innocent, for example, it's\\n\\n unjustified. Where does he read about that? In a\\n\\n complaint? No. He reads about it in the national\\n\\n press.\\n\\n \\n30  Now, that's a harmful thing. And -- and  seals are not just this case. They are national  security cases, privacy cases, trademark cases, all  kinds of business cases. So it is a serious thing when  someone deliberately breaks a court seal and reveals the  contents to the national press. Well, it's not just the  department that has an interest in this. It's the  United States judicial system that has an interest in  this. And that's what poses the problem. And your  opponent here is saying when you get to the bottom of  it, given the seriousness of what went on, this is too  light a sanction. At least that's how I'm seeing it.  And I would appreciate your comments on  that.</p><p> And before you -- I want to  get a thorough answer of this because -</p><p> -- however this case got  here, it's here. And so viewed in your legal framework  that's most favorable, I can read to you. I can read  your opponent as saying, look, say something and do  something, like remand it, that realize -- that makes  people realize this is a very serious thing. Though, of  course, I think you are right in saying this is the kind  of thing that district courts do as part of their job,  weighing various factors. But what would you want to  add to say to me, no, he was not overly lenient here?</p><p> Before you get to the facts  here, I have this thought in my mind, which is that this  is a court order. People don't normally take it on  themselves to decide whether to follow it or not. If  you don't like it, lift it. But while it's there,  follow it.  And this court order does have a possible  consequence in some case that if it is violated, it will  cause harm to a defendant who learns for the first time  that he is being sued by reading The New York Times.  Okay?  Now, that may or may not hurt some. It may  hurt some a lot. Now, can that be taken into account?  I would say in an appropriate case, absolutely. The  Court has to be concerned in working out a sanction, the\\n \\n44  overall fairness of the situation, and that's part of  it.  What do you think of that?</p><p> Okay.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>From -- from - perhaps from the defendant's point of view, but I  thought the whole purpose of sealing the materials was  not to tip off the defendant. And if that's so, then  the defendant would benefit from being tipped off, and  the government -- who I think you agree is the primary  concern of Congress to be protected -- the government  then would be left with the choice of either drop - dropping the suit or expending its own resources on it.  So the one that was really penalized, in  addition to the qui tam plaintiffs, is the government.</p><p> And if it's a condition  for the government's benefit, the government can waive  it.</p><p> But in Hallstrom --\\n\\n Hallstrom, the plaintiff could re-file. It wasn't -- it\\n\\n was -- it required notice. So the plaintiff could then\\n\\n give the notice and bring the suit again. But on your\\n\\n view, these plaintiffs are out irretrievably.</p><p> Yes, but that puts the\\n\\n government to the choice of not having the relator to go\\n\\n forward for it, and it has to either take up the reins\\n\\n itself or say, well, we have too many other things on\\n\\n our plate; we have to let it go.</p><p> And I thought the  question was suppose these plaintiffs didn't reveal the  complaint at all, but they described on a radio show, on  a TV show, what they understood to be State Farm's  practice. So the information came out, but not that  they had filed the complaint.</p><p> Can you -- can you tell  me, just clarify what 3730(b) means when it says the  action may be dismissed only if the Court and the  Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal  and their reasons for consenting.</p><p> When would the government\\n\\n be hurt by a sealing violation?</p><p> In your brief, you did\\n\\n say -- on page  of your brief, you said that\\n\\n reputational harm to the defendant could be relevant to\\n\\n \\n determining a sanction for seal violation.\\n\\n46</p><p> But what about the point\\n\\n that I made before with respect to Hallstrom? Hallstrom\\n\\n didn't put the plaintiffs out of court. It said they\\n\\n have to give the required notice. They have to give the\\n\\n notice to the government, the alleged violator. And I\\n\\n thought the purpose of that was to give the violator a\\n\\n chance to clean things up so there wouldn't be any suit.\\n\\n So those plaintiffs, if I understand Hallstrom right,\\n\\n \\n  just give the notice, wait the necessary number of days,  and go forward with their suit again.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>You said your test would  put -- would make bad faith primary. What exactly does  that mean? I mean, take a case where there was bad  faith, but in fact there was also a pretty minor breach  that was not likely to cause any harm, and in fact did  not cause any harm, and the government comes in to the  district court and says, it\\'s not in our interests for  this case to be dismissed. Why should the Court  nonetheless dismiss the case?</p><p> Well, then, what does it\\n\\n mean for bad -- why do you say -- is it -- how is it\\n\\n first among equals? Why isn\\'t it just something that a\\n\\n district court should take into account as this district\\n\\n court took it into account?</p><p> Well, but it did both. When\\n\\n -- when one factor is the seriousness of the violation,\\n\\n \\n  presumably one measures the seriousness of the violation  by asking whether the violation is likely to cause harm  ex-ante.  So it\\'s really looking to both. It\\'s  calling them different things, but it\\'s saying, we\\'re  going to check out the seriousness of the violation,  whether it\\'s likely to produce harm, what the risk of  harm is, and we\\'re going to ask in ways we ask in the  law all the time, did it in fact cause that harm?</p><p> If there is a primary  factor, why shouldn\\'t the primary factor just be what  the government wants? In other words, why shouldn\\'t  this be -- given that the government is the beneficiary  of this provision, why shouldn\\'t we give very\\n \\n significant discretion to the government?</p><p> Do you think deference ought  to be given to the government? And if so, as to what  parts of the test?</p><p> On actual harm?</p><p> And do you think it might be\\n \\n helpful for this Court to clarify that when we\\'re\\n\\n50\\n\\n talking about the severity of the violation, part of\\n\\n what we are talking about is the likelihood that the\\n\\n violation might cause harm?</p><p> I -- please. Sorry.</p><p> No, please.</p><p> You mentioned Hallstrom a\\n\\n couple of times --</p><p> -- and rely on it heavily in\\n\\n the briefs. But Hallstrom has very different statutory\\n\\n language. Hallstrom says no action may be commenced\\n\\n unless a condition is met.\\n\\n And, similarly, in 3730, the statute uses\\n\\n language that makes it clear that dismissal is\\n\\n appropriate when a mandatory requirement is not met. It\\n\\n says, \"the Court shall dismiss an action or claim.\" It\\n\\n says, \"in no event may a person bring an action.\" It\\n\\n says the court -- \"no court shall have jurisdiction.\"\\n\\n All of that way of -- all of those phrasings indicate\\n\\n what happens when a requirement isn\\'t satisfied.\\n\\n But there is no such language with respect\\n\\n \\n to this requirement. I mean, it\\'s a mandatory\\n\\n\\n\\n requirement, but it doesn\\'t say what happens if the\\n\\n requirement isn\\'t satisfied. And that makes it very\\n\\n different from Hallstrom and from the other language in\\n\\n Section 3730.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>But again, you didn't ask  for any sanction other than dismissal.</p><p> Let's assume for the  moment that there is a First Amendment right to discuss  the actions that took place.

Ms. Blatt.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p><p> Do you agree with  Ms. Blatt's statement that the government has never  before sought to gain a benefit from a vacated  conviction?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>Well, does that position  extend to anything that affects the evidence in the  case, so that if any prosecution evidence is improperly  admitted or any defense evidence is improperly excluded,  the same would follow?</p><p> They lack legal effect, but  it is a historical fact that it occurs. So surely they  can be used to prove a historical fact. For example,  suppose there's a case in which the -- in which the  question is whether a witness who testified for the  prosecution was bribed. Surely the -- the conviction  could be used in that situation, right?</p><p> I'm not sure that really\\n\\n answers the question. Because the vacated conviction\\n\\n may be worthless for a reason that is irrelevant to the\\n\\n point that Justice Kagan was making, which seems to be\\n\\n the situation here. It's -- it's a wrongful conviction\\n\\n because an element was missing, but that doesn't\\n\\n undermine the argument that the two verdicts were\\n\\n inconsistent.</p><p> I thought your answer to  Justice Ginsburg was that if there was a particular kind  of error that resulted in the reversal, then the  conviction could not be used to show inconsistency in  the verdicts.  Did I misunderstand your answer?</p><p> The question on which we  granted review refers to a vacated unconstitutional  conviction.  But is that what we have here? Is this an  unconstitutional conviction?</p><p> Well, it was an erroneous  instruction, so it was instructional error. Is that a  constitutional error?</p><p> Sorry. Is every\\n\\n instructional error a constitutional error?</p><p> Are you really arguing that\\n\\n it can't be used to prove a historical fact, that it's\\n\\n not a -- it cannot be a relevant historical fact?</p><p> It would have to be harmless\\n\\n beyond a reasonable doubt because it's a constitutional\\n\\n error?</p><p> So if there were a harmless\\n\\n error issue in this case, what would the standard be?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>The jury might have taken  care of that in this case. The jury might have reacted  to the overcharging by saying we're not -- we will  convict on the predicate offense, but we're not going to  convict on these compound offenses.\\n \\n49</p><p> Do you agree with\\n\\n Petitioner that if you have a jury finding, jury makes a\\n\\n finding, but that finding is infected by race\\n\\n discrimination, you can't use that for anything even\\n\\n though it's a jury finding?</p><p> It didn't say we're not  really sure.

So it's not -- I think you're not\\n\\n right to say the acquittals don't count under the\\n\\n government -- I mean, yes, they do count.</p><p> This jury, we know, did\\n\\n decide something.</p><p> I thought that in Yeager,\\n\\n the Court said there was no -- there was no conflict\\n\\n because there was no decision. A hung jury doesn't\\n\\n decide anything.</p><p> What about the question I\\n\\n asked you before? If we're trying to find out what this\\n\\n jury did, isn't it a reasonable assumption that they\\n\\n convicted on the bribery for which there was much\\n\\n evidence? They thought that having the compound crimes,\\n\\n the conspiracy and the travel, was just laying it on too\\n\\n thick, so they weren't going to convict on those. Why\\n\\n couldn't that have been?</p><p> But the Yeager case\\n\\n was -- the jury didn't reach any decision. Here, your\\n\\n jury did reach a decision. The decision was vacated\\n\\n because, in the court's view, the charge was erroneous.\\n\\n By the way, that's not -- it's not clear\\n\\n that the charge was erroneous, is it? There's a split\\n\\n on that issue.</p><p> The question is --</p><p> Is it quid pro quo, or is  it gratuity as well? As I understand it, there's a  circuit split.</p><p> Well, the jury was\\n\\n operating under the same charge with respect to the\\n\\n compound crimes. So in order to convict, it would have\\n\\n had to find there was neither quid pro quo nor gratuity.\\n\\n That's what it would have had to find, which would be\\n\\n inconsistent with finding --</p><p> Ms. Blatt -- but if we're\\n\\n trying to figure out what this jury found, you know,\\n\\n we're not what talking about claim preclusion. Claim\\n\\n preclusion -- there can never be a new trial on the\\n\\n travel or the conspiracy. But we're talking about issue\\n\\n preclusion.\\n\\n And this jury, we don't know what it decided\\n\\n because of the inconsistency. It said yes to bribery on\\n\\n one; no to bribery on the other. And it might have just\\n\\n decided that conviction of the predicate offense, the\\n\\n bribery, was enough, and that the government had laid it\\n\\n on too strong by adding the conspiracy and the travel\\n\\n count.\\n\\n How do we know that's not what the jury\\n\\n decided?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Ms. Blatt, it does seem to  me that\\'s what your argument rests on in the end: The  idea that we shouldn\\'t give any weight or any influence  to an invalid conviction. Is that a double jeopardy  principle, or does it come from someplace else?</p><p> You know, I think you\\'re  contesting the premise of my question. Because the  premise of my question is that this vacated conviction  does tell you something about what the jury did. Now  what it tells you is that the jury did inconsistent  things, because the vacated conviction tells you that,  on the one hand, the valid convictions, the jury said  that there was not bribery. And on the other hand, the  vacated conviction, the jury said there was bribery.  And let\\'s assume for the moment that that\\'s  true, that that is exactly what the vacated convictions\\n \\n tell you. They tell you that the jury went in two\\n\\n\\n\\n inconsistent ways.</p><p> Yes. Well, why do we do  that?  I mean, I take it you have -- you know,  usually you do pretend that they don\\'t exist. There are  not many instances that we can find where we do look to  vacated convictions for something or other. But in this  case, the vacated conviction surely does tell us  something about what the jury did do or what the jury  didn\\'t do. It\\'s part of the factual picture, and so the  question has to be, well, notwithstanding that, why  shouldn\\'t we look at it? And I guess the -- why?</p><p> What other purpose could you  use a vacated conviction for? Is there anything else  that the government can use a vacated conviction for, or  is this the only thing?</p><p> Who -- who\\'s not --</p><p> Look at the label. It\\'s\\n\\n void ab initio, but I mean, it\\'s void in the sense that\\n\\n you can\\'t be punished for a vacated conviction. But the\\n\\n question is, can we use what the vacated conviction\\n\\n tells us about a historical fact, or can we use it for\\n\\n some other purpose that, you know, that I\\'m not thinking\\n\\n about right now?</p><p> But -- but, you know,\\n\\n what\\'s -- what part of the Constitution are we looking\\n\\n to to tell us this?</p><p> That\\'s not the question I\\'m\\n\\n asking.</p><p> Ms. Blatt suggested that\\n\\n there\\'s something -- I think she used the word\\n\\n \"unseemly\" -- about using a vacated conviction for this,\\n\\n or indeed for any other purpose, given the traditions of\\n\\n our legal system where it\\'s just very hard to find\\n\\n instances in which we have done so.\\n\\n So, you know, I\\'m not sure I understand\\n\\n where the unseemliness prohibition comes from, but it\\n\\n does seem, you now, quite out of kilter with the\\n\\n traditions of our legal system to use vacated\\n\\n convictions in a manner that affects individuals\\'\\n\\n constitutional rights. So, I guess, tell me why we\\n\\n shouldn\\'t be concerned about that?</p><p> I think the tradition goes\\n\\n further. I mean, you have a tough time in your brief\\n\\n coming up with any instances, and the only times you do\\n\\n are -- are some -- a couple of scattered lower court\\n\\n \\n decisions. But you have, other than that, a really\\n\\n33\\n\\n tough time coming up with any instances in which courts\\n\\n have used vacated convictions for any purpose.</p><p> But that is the greater  remedy that Yeager gave, and I understand your  distinction between Yeager and this case, but it does  leave you with a fundamental anomaly, which is, in a  case in which there\\'s an acquittal and a hung count, the  acquittal is the only thing that matters. And in a case  where there\\'s an acquittal and a vacated conviction, you  know, where a court has said this has got to be -- this  has got to be reversed and it no longer exists, in that  case the person comes up with a far less good situation.</p><p> It makes sense in terms of  parts of Yeager\\'s reasoning, but not in terms of other  parts of Yeager\\'s reasoning.  Another part of Yeager\\'s reasoning just said  hung counts have never been accorded respect as a matter  of law or history. And similarly, one could say vacated  convictions have never been accorded respect as a matter  of law or history. They are vacated. They are  nullities. You don\\'t get respect for that.</p><p> Well, I guess I see -- when  I read Yeager, I see two different rationales, and on  one you\\'re exactly right. There\\'s a real distinction  with this case.  On the other, seems you\\'re exactly wrong.  There\\'s no distinction in this case at all because both  have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or  history.\\n \\n42</p><p> I\\'m sorry. I --</p><p> -- there, like, a legal\\n\\n principle here about why we shouldn\\'t look to vacated\\n\\n convictions to tell us something about the facts, when\\n\\n they can tell us something about the facts?</p><p> But what is it? What is the\\n\\n something else? Why can\\'t the government use a vacated\\n\\n conviction for any purpose?</p><p> And now you\\'re saying,\\n\\n notwithstanding that the vacated conviction tells you\\n\\n something about what the jury did or didn\\'t do about how\\n\\n the jury reasoned, we shouldn\\'t look at it.\\n\\n And there\\'s something very powerful,\\n\\n rhetorically, in your statement. But I guess what I\\'m\\n\\n trying to figure out: Is it anything more than\\n\\n rhetoric? Is --</p><p> So you have the history on\\n\\n your side, most of it. Do you think that that\\'s because\\n\\n the government, you know, cannot use a vacated\\n\\n conviction for any purpose?</p><p> This isn\\'t a double jeopardy\\n\\n argument. This is a something else argument.</p><p> Maybe one way I can figure\\n\\n out the scope of your argument is just to ask, do you\\n\\n think that the government is always unable to use a\\n\\n vacated conviction, that is for any purpose, or do you\\n\\n think that the government is unable to use a vacated\\n\\n conviction only for double jeopardy purposes?</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>In this case, could it be  argued -- was the argument before the jury on the  conspiracy in the travel counts closely intertwined with  666 so that it -- you can't say the jury decided most  likely on some issue that's irrelevant to 666?</p><p> I take it from that you  would agree that there might be cases where, under  Ashe v.

So suppose you -- we\\n\\n have the -- a school that\\'s run by the Trinity Lutheran\\n\\n Church of Columbia. And then next to it we have a -- a\\n\\n Jesuit elementary and secondary school. One would be\\n\\n eligible, one would not be eligible?</p><p> So what is the definition of\\n\\n a church? So a religiously-affiliated school is not a\\n\\n church under the -- under the Missouri constitution?</p><p> Okay. Last one. This is a\\n\\n New York City program that provides security -- money\\n\\n for security enhancements at schools where there\\'s fear\\n\\n of shooting or other school violence.</p><p> Okay. Here\\'s another one.  I have two more, if you\\'ll indulge me.  This is a Federal program that provided  grants for the repair of buildings near the Federal  building in Oklahoma City that were damaged by the\\n \\n\\n bombing there. Would that be permitted?\\n\\n33</p><p> Well, Mr. Layton, you said\\n\\n you don\\'t want to -- you don\\'t want to have a program\\n\\n that makes physical improvements to -- to churches. And\\n\\n I just wanted to ask you about some Federal laws that\\n\\n are highlighted in the amicus brief filed by the Union\\n\\n of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, and get your reaction\\n\\n \\n32  whether a program like that would be permissible under  the Missouri constitution.  So one of them is a Federal nonprofit  security grant program providing grants through the  Department of Homeland Security to harden -- harden  nonprofit organization facilities that are deemed to be  at high risk for terrorist attacks. So if you have a - a synagogue that is at high risk for an attack by an  anti-Semitic group or a mosque that is considered to be  at high risk for attack by an anti-Muslim group, would  the Missouri constitution permit the erection of  bollards like we have around the court here?</p><p> So if it\\'s controlled.</p><p> And Mr. Cortman, I don\\'t  know whether we -- excuse me. I don\\'t know whether we  need to get into the history of this particular  amendment here. I tend to think we don\\'t need to, but  at the beginning of the line of questioning that Justice  Sotomayor just finished, she began with the suggestion  that perhaps this amendment reflects an admirable  historical tradition that should be respected.  Do you think that that is the proper way to  analyze this question?</p><p> Mr. Cortman, do we know what\\n\\n Missouri -- how Missouri interprets the term \"church\" in\\n\\n its constitution? It speaks about church. Does it have\\n\\n to be -- is this a matter of the form of the ownership\\n\\n of a facility? Is this playground considered to be --\\n\\n by the State to be part of the church because of its\\n\\n proximity to the church? What if it was a -- what if we\\n\\n had a -- a religiously affiliated school that was not\\n\\n adjacent to a church and it had a playground. Would\\n\\n they consider that to be part of -- would they consider\\n\\n that to fall within the prohibition?</p><p> And what is the basis for  drawing that distinction? I thought that -- I thought  your asserted basis was it prevents the perception of  favoritism.</p><p> No. I\\'m not talking about  equal protection. You -- you said there\\'s -- that it  matters that this is selective as opposed to not  selective.</p><p> -- as far as the difference  between selective and nonselective?\\n \\n48</p><p> So what\\'s the difference  between that situation and this situation -</p><p> And -- and so long as the  money is granted based on neutral criteria that are  faithfully applied, I don\\'t know how you can draw a\\n \\n47  distinction between a program that\\'s open to everybody  and a selective program.  I mean, suppose Missouri offered 50 full  college scholarships every year to students who achieved  certain academic criteria -- who satisfied certain  academic criteria, and this was open to public school  students and private school students. But, you know,  after a few years, the school saw -- the State saw that  a disproportionate number of these were going -- among  those given to the religiously affiliate, to the private  schools, a disproportionate were -- a number of the  scholarships were going to students at schools that are  affiliated with a particular faith.  Would it be, then, justified to say, well,  we better not -- we better disqualify every student who  went to a religiously affiliated school so there aren\\'t  any hard feelings?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>If you -- if you make that\\n\\n the line, selective versus universal, if you like, you\\n\\n can reproduce the same problems. Volunteer fire\\n\\n departments, most places that the State give grants to\\n\\n upgrade -- upgrade. We don't have enough money, so we\\n\\n have a selection.\\n\\n Same with police. You have crossing guards.\\n\\n You know, you have dangerous intersections. There are\\n\\n crossing guards. We have grants to help the schools pay\\n\\n for the children.\\n\\n Do the same thing with health of children.\\n\\n You know, I can do that. That's what I see as a\\n\\n difficulty, we choose your line there, and we\\n\\n proliferate litigation forever.</p><p> In areas that are critical,\\n\\n like police, fire, health.</p><p> Yeah, I --</p><p> Of course. That's my\\n\\n \\n\\n problem. I can reproduce programs in the State that\\n\\n55\\n\\n seem absolutely necessary for police protection, fire\\n\\n protection, health of children. And it seems like an\\n\\n irrelevant factor, whether they're just open to\\n\\n everybody to apply and you automatically get it, or\\n\\n whether you have criteria and are selected because you\\n\\n have a limited amount of money. And you want to make\\n\\n that line the --</p><p> You suggested two lines.  I'm back to my question -</p><p> -- which is really quite  similar to what Justice Kagan is asking. You -- once  you accepted the first part of what I asked, you agree  there has to be a line.</p><p> Now, one line you've  suggested is the question that you're selecting rather  than giving to any -- everyone.</p><p> But would you say the same  case, were you to give the money to all schools instead  of just some by selection, then would be  unconstitutional barring churches? I don't think you  would. But wait. Say the other line.  The other line, which I want you to  contrast, is that where there is a grant given to all  schools, private and public, and the purpose -- and that  grant has nothing to do with religious practice, but it  does -- has to do with health or safety. Then you have  to do it. What about that?</p><p> That's -- that's -- because  you win -- you lose -- or you win on the first; you lose  on the second.</p><p> Now, they are two competing  lines that I'm at least seeing. Maybe there's some  others.</p><p> -- constitutional line on\\n\\n Free Exercise? I'm afraid of that one. Now, I put that\\n\\n out, so you can reply.</p><p> Has the -- has the -- the\\n\\n State courts, have they ever said the amendment prevents\\n\\n the State from giving grants or from spending money on\\n\\n police protection for churches?</p><p> Have they ever said that it\\n\\n prevents the State from, say, having a -- a border\\n\\n guard, you know, crossing guards or fire protection?\\n\\n Or, let's say, health inspections?</p><p> Okay.</p><p> In that case, why, just --\\n\\n just like you and the other side to spend a minute on\\n\\n this, just a minute, why isn't the case moot? That is,\\n\\n we have a governor. He said he's going to give you the\\n\\n grants. He said that we know for four years this is\\n\\n \\n  going to recur anyway. There's certainly -- of course,  it could happen, somebody brings the case in the Supreme  Court and they decide it differently in -- in -- in the  State.  But what case would you cite as closest to  the proposition? This is not moot -- you didn't ask for  money, did you?</p><p> You just want an injunction  for the future.</p><p> Yeah, I -</p><p> -- an epidemic?</p><p> Why in health context? So  if there's -</p><p> And you're going to get  that injunction, whether you want it or not, with the  present governor.</p><p> And that's -- well,  temporarily. Is there any chance he would change his  mind?</p><p> What?</p><p> No. I see that.  What case would you cite?</p><p> Okay.</p><p> Okay. Okay. Fine.</p><p> Yeah, but the whole - that's easy to change. I mean, we imagine a State,  State X. And State X says, we're not going to provide  police protection. We will for everybody, but not a  church. And by the way, that costs us extra money. We  have to hire extra policemen -- revoke.  Okay? That's all. Why not?</p><p> We don't want -- we  don't -- we don't want to because they're a church.  That's why not.  Same with fire protection. Same with  vaccination programs. Same with public health. Same  with helping children who get sick at school. Okay?  You know, the hypotheticals are obvious. Nothing to do  with Missouri. But as soon as you answer that, I'll be  able to know that ask you a question and how does this  differ. Okay?</p><p> No, I'm not asking that  yet.  (Laughter.)</p><p> I'm asking --\\n \\n\\n (Laughter.)\\n\\n37</p><p> I'm asking, does the\\n\\n Constitution of the United States permit a State or a\\n\\n city to say, we give everybody in this city police\\n\\n protection, but not churches? We give everybody fire\\n\\n protection, but let the church burn down. We give\\n\\n everybody public health protection, but not a church.\\n\\n That's -- that's the law in my imaginary State.\\n\\n And I'm saying, does the Constitution, which\\n\\n guarantees free exercise of religion, permit such laws?</p><p> All right. Now you say no,\\n\\n it does not permit those laws. Very well.\\n\\n If it does not permit a law that pays money\\n\\n out of the treasury for the health of the children in\\n\\n the church, school, or even going to church, how does it\\n\\n permit Missouri to deny money to the same place for\\n\\n helping children not fall in the playground, cut their\\n\\n knees, get tetanus, break a leg, et cetera? What's the\\n\\n difference?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>On that -- on that\\n\\n question, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson\\n\\n case back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms\\n\\n what the Framers didn't want was tax money imposed to\\n\\n pay for building or maintaining churches or church\\n\\n property. And doesn't that fit this case? And if so,\\n\\n is Everson pass?</p><p> We -- we did -</p><p> We did say in this  case -- well, I think you stipulated that this school  has a nondiscriminatory admissions policy. But suppose  it didn't. Suppose its policy was we prefer Lutheran  children, and then if we have any space left over after  that, we'll take other Christians. And then after that,  maybe Jews, and then everyone else. Everything else is  the same. They want the paving of their playground.  Could -- could this -- could they demand as  a matter of Federal constitutional right that that  playground be funded, even though they have an -- an  admissions policy that favors members of their church?</p><p> So this church could say,\\n\\n we will take only Lutheran children.</p><p> And -- and still get the\\n\\n public money.</p><p> There's two -- there's  two questions, isn't there? One is we're talking about  is the case moot, and I think, technically, it's not  moot. But if we think -- suppose Missouri had a policy  that it has today, very recently, and we were asked to  grant cert in this case. That would be a factor in our  decision whether we thought this was an appropriate case  to review, wouldn't it?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': \"<p>Mr. Layton, I'm struggling\\n\\n still to understand Justice Kagan's question, the answer\\n\\n to it.\\n\\n How is it that discrimination on the basis\\n\\n of religious exercise is better in selective government\\n\\n programs than general programs, first?\\n\\n And second, how do we tell the difference\\n\\n \\n53  between the two, if that's the line we're going to draw?  The tours, isn't it selective based on who  can show up at the Capitol and afford to do that?  Public benefit programs, aren't they often selective if  you meet criteria? Copyright laws? You have to have an  original work, things like that. What do we do about  those problems?</p><p> Imagine, why would it be  on the basis of a physical plant, as opposed to, say,  personnel or nonphysical grant money?</p><p> Now the line is moving.  Now it's apparently on the basis of whether we're  granting the money to physical plant or to some other  purpose. What is that -</p><p> Well, discrimination on  the basis of status of religion, there's no -- no  line-drawing problem there. We know that's happened in  this case, right?</p><p> But how do we draw the  line between selective and general? One -- one could  seem to play with that line forever.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>Mr. Layton, I understand  that -</p><p> -- and -- and you said no\\n\\n money to churches. Why can the State provide police\\n\\n protection or fire protection?</p><p> So, Mr. Layton, let's say  I -- I accept that the State might have an interest in  saying we just don't want to be seen as giving money to  one church and not another in these selective programs.</p><p> I -- I think that that's  legitimate.  But here's the thing. There's a  constitutional principle. It's as strong as any  constitutional principle that there is, that when we  have a program of funding -- and here we're funding  playground surfaces -- that everybody is entitled to\\n \\n40  that funding, to -- to that particular funding, whether  or not they exercise a constitutional right; in other  words, here, whether or not they are a religious  institution doing religious things. As long as you're  using the money for playground services, you're not  disentitled from that program because you're a religious  institution doing religious things.  And I would have thought that that's a  pretty strong principle in our constitutional law. And  how is that the State says that that's not violated  here?</p><p> I think -</p><p> But here's the deal. You're\\n\\n right that this is a selective program. It's not a\\n\\n general program in which everybody gets money. But\\n\\n still the question is whether some people can be\\n\\n disentitled from applying to that program and from\\n\\n receiving that money if they are qualified based on\\n\\n other completely nonreligious attributes, and they're\\n\\n disqualified solely because they are a religious\\n\\n institution doing religious things. Even though they're\\n\\n \\n42  not -- they could -- they could promise you, we're not  going to do religious things on this playground surface,  and you're still saying, well, no, you -- you can't get  the money.</p><p> Yes. And those are\\n\\n interests. I don't mean to say that those are not valid\\n\\n interests. But it does seem as though this is a clear\\n\\n burden -- looked at that way, this is a clear burden on\\n\\n a constitutional right. And then your interests have to\\n\\n rise to an extremely high level.</p><p> It's a burden on\\n\\n constitutional right, in other words, because people of\\n\\n a certain religious status are being prevented from\\n\\n competing in the same way everybody else is for a\\n\\n neutral benefit.</p><p> Mr. Layton, could we go back\\n\\n to where Justice Alito started --</p><p> But I don't understand - I -- I think I understand how the States' interests  might differ some, but essentially this is a program  open to everyone. Happens to be a competitive program,  but everyone is open to compete on various neutral  terms, and you're depriving one set of actors from being  able to compete in the same way everybody else can\\n \\n\\n compete because of their religious identification.\\n\\n49</p><p> Mr. Cortman, my questions  about religious uses, I think, was to get at a -- a  broader point, a broader distinction, and asked -- ask  what you think of it. And as it seems that you are on  strongest ground when you say, look, the State has  decided to fund some activity, and it's denying that - that funding to a particular party based solely on that  party's religious status.</p><p> And that's the way you  briefed the case.  I hear you making a different argument, or a  broader argument now, that extends into a State's  decision to deny some uses -- to deny funding to some  uses at the same time as it gives funding to other uses,  and a State's decision to say, look, we really just  don't want to fund religious exercise. They can do  religious exercise. We don't want to fund religious  exercise. And I understand that you might think that's  out of bounds, too. But what I'm trying to figure out  is, is there a distinction between these two things.</p><p> Okay. So you don't disagree  with that.</p><p> But the State is entitled to  say you can't use this money for religious activity, and  maybe I'll bring you a little bit further, we're  entitled to take certain prophylactic measures to make  sure that you don't use the money for religious  activity.</p><p> Well, then how about the -</p><p> Would you say --</p><p> Well, I'm sorry --</p><p> How would you -- for  example, one of the things that the Court has -- has  thought about in the past is like computers for  education. So I guess somebody could make the same  argument about computers. Well, it doesn't really - it's separate from the religious instruction that might  be carried out over those computers.  Do you think that that's the same, or is it\\n \\n\\n different?</p><p> That they -- I'm sorry.  They don't think they should -</p><p> So do you think,  Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a - from a -- a church that used its playground for  religious activities. Had prayer services there, for  example. Could the State, in your view, deny the money  on that ground, or at least would you think that that  was a significantly different case?</p><p> But -</p><p> -- this institution. And\\n\\n these -- these church/States divide, it's a -- it's a\\n\\n fraught issue. It's a hard issue. It's a -- it's an\\n\\n issue in which States have their own very longstanding\\n\\n law. It's an issue on which I -- I guess I'm going to\\n\\n say nobody is completely sure that they have it right.\\n\\n And -- and so I guess there's something attractive about\\n\\n having some play in the joints where States can go their\\n\\n own way and make their own choices. And why shouldn't\\n\\n this be one of those cases?</p><p> Well, that's, of course,  true, that if there's a -- a constitutional right at  stake, that trumps. But the question is, how are we  going to interpret the constitutional right? What are  we -- so -- so I guess what I'm asking is, do you see  value in the other side in having some flexibility here  for States to make these sorts of choices?</p><p> But one last -- I know your\\n\\n white light is on. But might the State think that\\n\\n here's the problem. The problem is this church has come\\n\\n in with a very competitive application. We want to give\\n\\n money to this church. Let's say, you know, a Protestant\\n\\n church. There's a Catholic church across the street.\\n\\n Catholic church applies, doesn't get money, this happens\\n\\n five years running. And people start thinking, well,\\n\\n why is the Protestant church keeping on getting the\\n\\n money and the Catholic church never gets the money? And\\n\\n the State says, we just won't -- don't want to sow that\\n\\n kind of division, that kind of mistrust, that kind of --\\n\\n well, that --</p><p> Mr. Layton --</p><p> May I take you back to the  substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's  talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I  would like to know. You know, usually when we see these  funding cases, it comes in a different context. It  comes where the State wants to give money and somebody  is objecting. And this case comes in the converse way,\\n \\n\\n where a State says we just don't want to fund --</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>I mean, you could say the  same thing, that -- that the church is delighted that it  has fire protection.</p><p> Yes. I -</p><p> And is it your argument\\n\\n that this statute is valid to keep us away from close\\n\\n Establishment Clause questions?</p><p> But -- but this -- this is\\n\\n quite different than Locke, because this is a\\n\\n status-based statute.</p><p> Are all of these questions\\n\\n really ones that verge onto the Establishment Clause;\\n\\n fire extinguishers, bible lessons on a sunny day, and so\\n\\n forth?

No one is taking the playground away from you.</p><p> Excuse me, but you were  talking about Locke -</p><p> Well, there is a  tradition. There are 39 States with constitutional  amendments like the one Missouri has. That's a history  that's even longer than the Locke history. And the  essence of that history is, basically, we don't want to,  as a country -- well, the vast majority of States, to  fund houses of worship. One would think that if there's  play in the joints, that that would include the concept  that States are free to say we don't want to spend money  from the public FIs on houses of worship.  Now, you say this affects free exercise. We  seem to be confusing money with religious practice. I  don't think the two are tied. This church is not going  to close its religious practices or its doors because  its playground doesn't have these tires. So I'm not  sure how this is a free-exercise question, because there\\n \\n  is no effect on the religious beliefs. No one is asking  the church to change its beliefs. In fact, no one is  asking the church as a condition of saying don't use  what we give you for religious purposes; they're not  even doing that. They're just saying we don't want to  be involved with the church.</p><p> But why is that coercion  with respect to your beliefs?</p><p> -- and how this is  dissimilar from Locke.</p><p> But you can have a  playground here.</p><p> What are we going to do  with all the exemptions that churches receive?</p><p> But I don't. I'm just  saying there are people who make that claim.</p><p> Well, there's plenty of  people who would think tax exemption goes too far.</p><p> Those are benefits.</p><p> What do we do with  discrimination for religion under your theory? Because  the way you're going in your theory is an expansion of  McDaniel; but putting aside that it's an expansion of  McDaniel, what are we going to end up with when secular  people say religious people are being discriminated in  favor of and against us? If status should not be an  effect on free exercise, what are we going to do with  tax benefits?</p><p> Well, how about if the\\n\\n school does a prayer before the children start playing?</p><p> Here, there's nothing  being taken away from.</p><p> So how is the building\\n\\n separate from the religious exercise therein? I believe\\n\\n that this playground is part of the ministry of this\\n\\n church. And, in fact, I look at its bylaws, I look at\\n\\n its advertisements, and it includes play and conducted\\n\\n in a religiously valuable way. I think that's the\\n\\n materials that you're -- that the church is advertising.\\n\\n How do you separate out its secular function\\n\\n from its religious function?</p><p> There is a serious\\n\\n debate about that, isn't there?</p><p> Or how about if it\\n\\n \\n  chooses on a sunny day to do its religious instruction  outside. How does the State know or how can it control  without then controlling on the -- on the basis of  belief and viewpoint?

It doesn't appear to be the position of the\\n \\n\\n State right now.

Sorry to stop you so early on, but I did not understand  that to be the argument in your brief.  I\\'m looking at the heading C on page 36.  Section 1344() requires proof of an intent to deceive a  bank, not to cause it monetary loss.

So his ignorance of the law is a\\n\\n defense?</p><p> You get -- you get  mired in some very abstract concepts of property rights.  Yes, someone is insured, but here if they keep getting  their property stolen, their insurance rates go up.  Here, okay, it wasn\\'t that if you -- correct, it wasn\\'t  the bank\\'s own property, but it\\'s somebody else\\'s  property that they use in making loans. And, again,  they will have less money to make loans if the property  is -- is being taken.  Now, does your case turn on what the  defendant knows even if that\\'s not right? I mean, the  argument may as well -- people commonly think you put  your money in the bank, it\\'s your money, and they\\'ll  give it back, but of course it\\'s loaned out by the bank.  But if the defendant really thinks I\\'m not -- I don\\'t  want to take anything from the bank. I\\'m taking this  from two -- and he\\'s wrong, is -- is he off the hook?</p><p> We\\'ll hear argument  next in Case 15991, Shaw v. United States.  Ms. Bell.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KOREN L. BELL  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Well, then if that\\'s  the case, then it all comes down to the instruction,  deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of  something of value.  Because you -- as I understand your position  as clarified, you do have to have the intent to deprive  a financial institution of something of value.</p><p> Okay. Well, then  it\\'s all a question of whether \"deceive\" and \"cheat\"  stand alone, or if they are also modified by \"of  something of value.\"</p><p> The enduring  consequence to Mr. Shaw is a little bit different, so -</p><p> Well, but you\\'ve\\n\\n kind of -- instruction, you do read it in context, but\\n\\n if I read instruction  in the context of , it kind\\n\\n of highlights that you have deceive or cheat separate\\n\\n from the deprivation of something of value.\\n\\n So linguistically, you have to say that what\\n\\n they meant in the instructions was somebody who intends\\n\\n to deceive a financial institution of something of\\n\\n value. And that\\'s just not grammatical.</p><p> Case is submitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (Whereupon, at :51 a.m., the case in the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> Thank you, counsel.</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Bell, you have three minutes remaining.  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KOREN L. BELL  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> It\\'s just not the  instruction. It\\'s what the court of appeals held. The  court of appeals held, in short -- this is a quote - \"The defendant was guilty of bank fraud because he  intended to deceive the bank.\" Full stop. So it\\'s not  just a problem with the instructions. It\\'s a problem  with what the court of appeals held.</p><p> -- Because it makes  no sense to say deceive of something of value.</p><p> Not if they -- not  if they -- not if they read instruction , which  talks -- has nothing to do with -- it just says intent  to deceive or cheat, nothing of something of value. And  when you quote the instruction on page 46 to make it  read, to make it make sense, you have to add in, as you  do, after deceive, deceive the bank out of something of  value -</p><p> And so in , sales\\n\\n deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of\\n\\n something of value. \"Something of value\" goes right\\n\\n along with \"deprive,\" but it doesn\\'t go along with\\n\\n \"deceive.\"</p>', 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>That's not what it means.</p><p> That's not what it means.\\n\\n And maybe something more is required. Maybe it has to\\n\\n be deprive of an ownership interest or cause a loss, but\\n\\n depriving of a possessory interest is not the same as\\n\\n causing a loss to the bank.</p><p> No. That's not what it\\n\\n means.</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>So if you\\'re insured and  the -- or at least the defendant believes he\\'s insured,  it isn\\'t theft?</p><p> Even Kardashian\\'s thief, if  there is one, believes that all that jewelry is insured.  Indeed over insured. So it\\'s not theft?</p><p> No, it says defraud. She\\n \\n lied. He says I\\'m knocking on the door -- you know,\\n\\n\\n\\n I\\'ll go as far as you want. But I don\\'t see that that\\n\\n has anything to do with it. You mean if he -- if he\\n\\n defrauds him out of the money, he defrauds her out of\\n\\n the jewelry, says here I a.m., your local jewelry\\n\\n cleaner. Gets the jewelry. Wouldn\\'t you think that was\\n\\n fraud? Even if she\\'s insured. Even if he thinks she\\'s\\n\\n triple insured. Even if he thinks that, in fact, this\\n\\n isn\\'t even her jewelry, that it was just loaned her on\\n\\n the occasion by a good friend, the necklace.</p><p> What the statute says is\\n\\n defraud.</p><p> I\\'m not asking you to\\n\\n repeat it. I\\'m asking you, if the local person comes to\\n\\n the door and says, dear Miss Kardashian, I a.m. your\\n\\n local jewelry cleaner. Please give me your jewelry.\\n\\n She does. And that\\'s not fraud. He wanted to get the\\n\\n \\n  jewelry. He tried to get the -- he also believed that  the friend had just loaned it for the evening, that  she\\'s triple insured, that she won\\'t even lose any money  because the publicity will be worth it. Okay?</p><p> Now, my question is:  There\\'s the statute. I would have always thought from  first year of law school, criminal law, that that was  fraud, but perhaps I was wrong. So I would like you to  explain it.</p><p> What it says in the  instructions is, \"Intent to deceive, cheat, or deprive a  financial institution of something of value.\"</p><p> So what\\'s the problem?</p><p> So the \"or\" goes between  \"to deceive, cheat, or deprive.\"</p><p> But what you have to cheat,  deceive, or deprive them of, is something of value.</p><p> And a possessory interest  is something of value. So what are you arguing about?</p><p> But not of anything. It  doesn\\'t say anything, what it seeks to deprive them of.  And then it comes out of the blue and  says -</p><p> So what\\'s the right words?</p><p> For the -- I mean, there --\\n\\n there are many situations. Do you -- you require an\\n\\n intent that there be property? Well, how do you want to\\n\\n say it, an intent to injure the bank in its property?\\n\\n How do you say it? Look, some people, bank robbers go\\n\\n into banks. They take the customers -- they line the\\n\\n customers up against the wall, and they take out their\\n\\n \\n billfolds. Is that defrauding the bank?\\n\\n45</p><p> Yeah, yeah. So how do you\\n\\n want to do this one?</p><p> There was, but it was a\\n\\n property interest in the bank. What do you have to\\n\\n prove in respect to that property interest is in the\\n\\n defendant\\'s mind?</p><p> In order to obtain\\n\\n something of value, so that it could be of value and\\n\\n belong only to the customer?</p><p> Yes. That\\'s why I want to\\n\\n know -- that\\'s why I need to know the words.\\n\\n \\n46</p><p> The deceive was separate.\\n\\n You would have to deceive the financial institution as\\n\\n to a material fact, which is defined in instruction \\n\\n as one that has a natural tendency to influence a\\n\\n financial institution to part with money or property.\\n\\n So what you took away in instruction , you\\n\\n gave back in instruction . So it\\'s a --</p><p> It says you have to execute\\n\\n a scheme or defraud a financial -- to defraud a\\n\\n financial institution as to a material fact. So that\\n\\n assumes it was separate.</p><p> -- which is what you have\\n\\n \\n in instruction .\\n\\n36</p><p> It\\'s okay once you put in\\n\\n the word \"material\" --</p><p> -- someone intends a  financial institution of value. That\\'s what you think  it means.</p><p> Okay. Did you make that\\n \\n argument in the court below?</p><p> What page? Do you have it\\n\\n here, by chance, what page you made that particular\\n\\n argument?</p><p> By watching the movies,  most -- I\\'d be afraid, in this case, that we\\'re going to  write something of five pages that nobody\\'s going to  understand, with the simple thing, Jessie James goes up  to the bank, says, your money or your life. He sees  behind the teller is a drawer, and you know he\\'s -- that  in that drawer, the last five customers have given him\\n \\n some money. That\\'s the money he wants.\\n\\n\\n\\n It doesn\\'t matter whether, in fact, the bank\\n\\n is going to put that money in Joe Smith\\'s account, or\\n\\n whether the bank has something called a possessory\\n\\n interest or something else. And in fact, if Jessie\\n\\n James\\' brother comes up and says, Jessie James is on the\\n\\n way, give me the money, it should be the same result.\\n\\n Now that\\'s very simple-minded, but -- and\\n\\n it\\'s built in me by the movies, but if, in fact, you\\n\\n have a different approach, I would like to know where in\\n\\n the law that different approach is, and why it is,\\n\\n and -- and how this does -- how this is -- I\\'m afraid,\\n\\n in other words, of confusion.\\n\\n You unconfuse me, please.</p><p> Well, my question is, why\\n\\n hasn\\'t Jessie James or his brother committed a crime --\\n\\n the brother, probably, because he\\'s lied and says Jessie\\n\\n James is on the way, and whether the money behind the\\n\\n desk was put there, to everyone\\'s knowledge, by the\\n\\n depositors, or whether the money happens to have been\\n\\n \\n  there for 50 years by the bank -- put in by the bank\\'s  founder, makes no difference to this statute. And I  want to know why it should, or anything else you want to  say about that.</p><p> You have a lot of cases,  and I think the model penal code started it, where you  have the word \"intent\" in a statute normally, not  always, but normally it covers both purpose and  knowledge. So that if you try to murder the queen by  blowing up the carriage, a famous example, and that  would lead to the death of the footman, even though you  love the footman, you are still guilty of killing the\\n \\n footman through murder. Okay. That\\'s the famous\\n\\n\\n\\n example.</p><p> So intent includes, unless\\n\\n there\\'s some contrary which you could argue, to the\\n\\n both. The statute that can -- the instruction they have\\n\\n to show, scheme to defraud, means that the person\\n\\n intends, which means he has knowledge that, as I take\\n\\n it, to deceive, cheat or deprive. That\\'s where the \"or\"\\n\\n is, deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of\\n\\n something of value.\\n\\n So I looked at that and I thought, what\\'s\\n\\n the problem? What\\'s the problem? That\\'s what I want\\n\\n you to explain.</p><p> In other words, you think  it means \"deceive, cheat, or deprive\"?</p><p> It\\'s not saying intends to\\n\\n cheat or deceive somebody, and then a separate thing, or\\n\\n deprive the financial institution of value. It\\'s intend\\n\\n to deceive, cheat or deprive. Who? A financial\\n\\n institution. Of what? Of something of value.\\n\\n So what is wrong with that instruction?\\n\\n That\\'s -- that\\'s what I need explanation.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>And can you clarify for\\n\\n us, what is in the overlap area?

She says those\\n\\n are the same things. You say they\\'re different things.\\n\\n Let\\'s assume you\\'re right. Let\\'s assume that that\\'s --\\n\\n that whether the bank in the end suffers a monetary loss\\n\\n is utterly irrelevant to the form of intent that\\'s\\n\\n required by this statute. All right? So you won that\\n\\n one, let\\'s say.</p><p> Say, Mr. Yang, the  instructions.</p><p> They\\'re kind of right. It  doesn\\'t -- it doesn\\'t parse neatly under either reading.  But I have to say that if I\\'m a reader, the way I\\n \\n38  understand this is you have to -- you have to show - the scheme has to be one to deceive a bank, to cheat a  bank or to deprive a bank of something of value. And in  that case, the \"deceive a bank\" is operating as a  disjunctive clause without the \"of something of value.\"</p><p> No, it\\'s got to be that  you\\'re deceiving somebody.</p><p> Yes. But the bank -- the  bank has to have a possessory interest in -- a property  interest in this thing.</p><p> I quoted you it was, that  it\\'s an -- it\\'s an intent to deprive the bank of a  property, including a possessory interest.</p><p> Well, I think it\\'s more than\\n\\n grammatical. It\\'s just -- like, it doesn\\'t make sense.</p><p> Well, I don\\'t think so  because that would make no sense. It would be the  scheme must be one to deceive a bank of something of  value. Whoever would use words like that?</p><p> It\\'s to deceive a bank  alone, cheat a bank alone, or deprive a bank of  something of value. And so I\\'m a juror. I say, well,  it\\'s enough if the bank was deceived.</p><p> Most of them don\\'t care.</p><p> No.</p><p> Which you -- which you now\\n\\n include can include possessory interests.</p><p> But it -</p><p> I think it -</p><p> So, Ms. Bell, I guess -- I  guess what Justice Kennedy is suggesting and maybe I\\'m  confused about the same thing, it now seems to me that  there\\'s no difference between your view and the  government\\'s view.  So, Mr. Yang, I\\'m putting you on notice that  this is a question to you too, because both of you are  saying, look, there needs to be an intent to deceive the  bank.</p><p> And there needs to be an  intent to deprive the bank of some form of property\\n \\n interest, but with the recognition that property\\n\\n\\n\\n interests includes possessory interests, as well as more\\n\\n classic ownership interests. And you agree with that.</p><p> I\\'m going to think, and\\n\\n Mr. Yang you\\'ll tell me, that Mr. Yang would agree with\\n\\n that too. So what are we fighting about?</p><p> Then it\\'s just -- Mr. Yang\\n\\n would say, well, look, a bank has a possessory interest\\n\\n in assets that are part of its depositor\\'s account, and\\n\\n so, you know, that\\'s -- whether you target the\\n\\n depositor\\'s account or you target something else, you\\'re\\n\\n still manifesting the same intent to deprive the bank of\\n\\n a property including possessory interest.</p><p> That seems right to me. I\\n\\n want to point, you know, that you might say all of that\\n\\n is right and that the government and you agree, and what\\n\\n you really disagree on is whether these instructions\\n\\n \\n  reflected that correct understanding of the law. And  that seems fair to me. And we should talk about the  instructions.</p><p> But it seems to me that the  understanding of the law is now you are in perfect  harmony.</p><p> If you really mean an intent  to deceive is not enough, that you need something about  to deprive the bank of its property interest.</p><p> Well, not just the heading,  but analysis in that part C as well. I mean, the part C  just seems to contradict part A or B or whichever it  was.</p><p> I\\'m not saying it does. I  think it\\'s a hard question as to whether the  instructions do or don\\'t, but it does seem to me you  have an argument about the instructions.</p><p> Ms. Bell, I think your  answer is, no, Your Honor, because the instructions  don\\'t reflect your understanding of the law.</p><p> Mr. Yang, you referred to\\n\\n us, money in a security deposit. Your answer would be\\n\\n \\n the same, right --\\n\\n51</p><p> -- if -- if somebody went in\\n\\n and said, I\\'d like to see the security deposit boxes,\\n\\n and -- and made a false statement to the bank about his\\n\\n entitlement to see the security deposit boxes and took\\n\\n the money out?</p><p> I mean, that suggests to me\\n\\n that as long as the person knows that the money is\\n\\n being -- is in the bank somehow, it just shouldn\\'t\\n\\n matter, because anything counts as a possessory\\n\\n interest, right?</p><p> What you\\'re essentially\\n\\n saying is that anything I can think of, any hypothetical\\n\\n I can think of which involves my hanging on to something\\n\\n for somebody else, that I have a possessory interest in\\n\\n that sufficient to satisfy this scheme.</p><p> Doesn\\'t -- you know, the\\n\\n bank still has a possessory interest in that, even\\n\\n though it doesn\\'t use that money in the same way; is\\n\\n that correct?</p><p> -- and that\\'s a\\n\\n misrepresentation.</p><p> Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I\\n\\n mean --</p><p> Let me give you another\\n\\n example. Suppose that I\\'m sitting in a coffee shop and\\n\\n somebody comes up to me and says, I have to make a phone\\n\\n call; would you just hang on to my computer for a\\n\\n minute? And then disappears, and then somebody else\\n\\n comes up, the fraudster comes up, and says, oh, she just\\n\\n told me to pick up her computer from her --</p><p> Do I -- have I had a\\n\\n possessory interest in that computer just because\\n\\n somebody said, why don\\'t you take a look, you know --\\n\\n you know -- keep -- keep your eye on this?</p><p> But I give him the computer.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>But it has a possessory\\n\\n interest --</p><p> And that possessory  interest is harmed. It's the harm to the interest, not  the harm to the entity.</p><p> But it was -- was it not a  harm to the possessory interest?</p><p> Well, design here, the\\n\\n intent here is to harm whoever has a lawful possessory\\n\\n interest.</p><p> Okay. But here we have a  bank. What did this defendant have to know about this  bank, if anything?</p><p> It has to know that a  financial institution is involved?</p><p> I mean, that's Section .</p><p> That the bank is likely  involved? I mean, this is pretty easy because he sent a  check, but -</p><p> What does he have to know  about? Does he have to know that the bank is involved?  I mean, what does he have to know about the bank?\\n \\n47</p><p> Well, what is the -- what  do we cite for that? Is there something in our cases  that say that the instructions had to be read in the\\n \\n41  context of what the jury heard or something like that?</p><p> I mean, we'd say close  enough for government work.</p><p> You want us to write an\\n\\n opinion -- you want us to write an opinion and say it's\\n\\n perfectly lawful under this statute, section (), to\\n\\n knowingly deprive someone of a possessory interest by\\n\\n deception?</p><p> You want us to write that?</p><p> Intend to deprive someone\\n\\n by deception of a possessory interest is proper. You\\n\\n need something more. That's what you -- that's what you\\n\\n are saying?</p><p> In its what?</p><p> But could we talk about\\n\\n the instruction? I know --\\n\\n \\n33</p><p> -- that's the -- that's  the last part of your argument. We want it first. Do  you mind? Okay.</p><p> Well, we know there's a  big picture in the world, but we want to know about the  instructions first.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': '<p>-- with your basic\\n \\n premise that you need to prove pecuniary loss to the\\n\\n56\\n\\n bank -- I know you want to win that, but please accept\\n\\n my hypothetical. I disagree with you that the only --\\n\\n that the only issue is that you have to cheat and\\n\\n deprive the bank of a possessory -- of something in a\\n\\n possessory -- in their possessory interest. Okay?\\n\\n Simple as that. It doesn\\'t have to cause -- you don\\'t\\n\\n have to intend to cause pecuniary loss. All right?\\n\\n Where does that leave your instructional\\n\\n error?</p><p> All right. So if we  disagree with you, if we were to say that this  subsection  means that you are targeting property  that -- depriving any bank of property in which it has a  possessory interest -</p><p> -- and we say you don\\'t  have to prove the bank is going to lose anything of  value, that it\\'s going to be reimbursed by insurance or  that ultimately the customer is going to receive -- bear  the loss, so long as you have defrauded the bank, some  deception to the bank, and deprived it of some  possessory interest, whether it bears the loss or not,  if that\\'s how we rule, do you lose this case?</p><p> We\\'re disagreeing with  you. That\\'s how we\\'re going to say what it means.</p><p> All right. Do you  think -</p><p> And you can deprive  someone of property without deceiving or cheating them.  You can rob them, right?</p><p> All right. So I  thought -- and this is what Justice Kagan was getting  to -- it has to be that you deceive or cheat and deprive  someone of property, correct?</p><p> Of defrauding.</p><p> You -- you defraud  someone by deception.</p><p> That\\'s why you say it\\'s  two different elements.</p><p> So far, I perfectly  understand your point.</p><p> That the defraud element  has two prongs to it; deception, for the lack of - deception is one prong and deprivation is the other.  You\\'re taking the money by -- or the possessory interest  by deception.  And you\\'re saying that by using the  disjunctive, the \"or,\" the jury could have convicted  merely for deceiving the bank, but didn\\'t find that they  deceived \"and\" deprived the bank of a possessory  interest, correct?</p><p> Now, Justice Breyer has  asked the operative question.</p><p> And -- and it\\'s what  confused me throughout, both in the discussions below  and here.  At first, I thought this case was only about  reading your brief about whether the deprivation had to  be of something the bank owned.</p><p> As opposed to had a  possessory interest in. And Justice Kagan rightly says  you seem to have backed off from that claim. You seem  to be saying \"owned\" can mean merely a possessory  interest. Is that correct, now?</p><p> The question is if I  disagree -</p><p> I -- I know what your  two claims are.</p><p> That -- that you weren\\'t  clear in the instruction, don\\'t you forfeit that  argument?</p><p> It took a lot of teasing  out.  Does -- how does that affect what we do.</p><p> -- that there were parts  of your argument, both below and here in your brief,  that suggested the instructional error. But what I find  is that the way you presented the argument was  confusing.</p><p> Counselor, assume I  agree with you -</p><p> How about if I find that\\n\\n what you -- that you didn\\'t articulate your argument\\n\\n clearly enough to the court below, or to us? Where does\\n\\n that put you? Have you forfeited? Do you waive? Have\\n\\n you done something?</p><p> Don\\'t forget instruction\\n\\n . You\\'re cherry-picking.</p><p> An intent to defraud is\\n\\n an intent to deceive or cheat.</p><p> Why has -- why has the\\n\\n government forgotten when it\\'s at trial that simplifying\\n\\n things for juries is always the best thing? Do you\\n\\n really think that any juror reading this would parse it\\n\\n with the care that you are? Why can\\'t you just say\\n\\n \\n40  something like a scheme to defraud a bank is a scheme  to -- what was the three words? -- to deceive or cheat  the money and to -- to cheat the bank of some interest  in money or property?</p><p> So nothing of value has  been taken. You can cheat the bank in that way, too,  out of moving something somewhere, but not to take it.  Okay?</p><p> All right. Someone can\\n\\n \\n  open up an account in a false name. They\\'ve deceived  the bank, but it\\'s not to cheat the bank of anything its  holding. But it\\'s to the cheat the wife who he wants to  hide money from, right?</p><p> All right. Why don\\'t we\\n\\n just, instead of using intent --</p><p> I\\'m sorry. Possessory  right means I own something. I\\'m holding it. In most  criminal charges for larceny, the issue is whether I  have a possessory right, regardless of what I want to do\\n \\n  with this property, over you who\\'s taken it from me. So  where do you get the next step that possessory right  means I have to lose something of value or that I\\'m  going to ultimately bear the loss? Isn\\'t the loss  merely the loss of the possessory right?</p><p> My colleague Justice\\n\\n Alito has written extensively on this issue of intent\\n\\n versus knowledge.</p><p> All right. You can\\n\\n deceive someone without taking property, right?</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>What is it that the  proceeding that you would have, I mean, if we accept  your proposal and -- and interview the jurors, subject  them to the -- what do you -- what do you ask them?</p><p> Do you think the\\n\\n entire body of law that we have developed in connection\\n\\n with racial discrimination or the Equal Protection\\n\\n Clause is the issue and apply that to your case? For\\n\\n example, here, you have a very obviously offensive and\\n\\n direct appeal to -- to race. What if it's, oh, you\\n\\n know, he's from that neighborhood; I know people from\\n\\n that -- people from that neighborhood always commit\\n\\n crimes like this.\\n\\n Now, obviously, that could well be\\n\\n challenged as based on race, or -- I mean, is that also,\\n\\n do you impeach the jury's -- the secrecy of the jury\\n\\n proceedings for something like that?</p><p> No. It's not just  alleged bias. It's bias based on innate characteristics  of the offensive remarks. But the question is: What is  most likely to -- or a significant risk of depriving the  defendant of a fair trial? And it seems to me there are  statements that have nothing to do with race or gender  or sexual orientation or anything that might have a far  greater impact. And I'm wondering why we -- we don't  allow impeachment of the jury verdict in those cases?  Someone, I don't know, comes in and says, I  know that witness. That witness lies all the time.  Believe me, you can't take anything he says. I mean  that, in a certain -- in a particular case, could have a  greater impact.  So why don't we allow impeachment of the  jury processes in that case?</p><p> What about sexual\\n\\n \\n  orientation? Somebody gives, you know, a bigoted speech  in the jury room about sexual orientation and how  particular types of people are more likely to commit  crimes like the one before them? Is that sufficiently  odious?</p><p> You think it's\\n\\n odious to have the same sort of discrimination against\\n\\n someone because he's a Muslim or practices Islamic\\n\\n faith? You're saying, he's a Muslim. Of course, you\\n\\n know, given this, I know how Muslims behave; he\\n\\n committed this crime. Is that not sufficiently like\\n\\n racial discrimination that it should be carved out?</p><p> No, I don't think\\n\\n that's fair. Once we decide race -- this is not an\\n\\n equal protection case; it's a Sixth Amendment case. So\\n\\n a recent invocation of race is an impermissible --\\n\\n impermissible enough, I guess, that we will pierce the\\n\\n jury confidentiality. Well, the next case is going to\\n\\n be religion. So whatever we say on race is going to\\n\\n have to have either a limiting principle that makes\\n\\n sense, or it's going to open up a broad category of\\n\\n cases.</p><p> All right. Well,\\n\\n that seems to be avoiding the question. Let's say there\\n\\n isn't Catholics.</p><p> What about religious  bias? Same thing in this case, except it's not, you\\n \\n know, this is how Mexicans act. It's this is how\\n\\n\\n\\n Catholics or Jews act, so they're obviously guilty.\\n\\n Wouldn't that also come under your exception?</p><p> We'll hear argument  next in Case -606, Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado.  Mr. Fisher.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Okay. But the facts  are as alleged here, I guess. What do you do once you  have that in -- in the record? What's next?</p><p> So if the other  jurors come in and they testify, there's testimony and  everybody says, yes, that's what he said, and they say,\\n \\n well, what would you -- but of course the guy was\\n\\n\\n\\n guilty, no doubt about it, and the other  said, of\\n\\n course he was guilty, it was very offensive what, you\\n\\n know, HC or whatever it was said, but, of course, he was\\n\\n guilty. Everybody -- we agreed to -- you know, in five\\n\\n minutes. Does that make a difference?</p><p> But what other types  of questions would -- what types of questions would you  propound if you were trying to elicit whether there was  bias on the part of a prospective juror?</p><p> Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n Mr. Yarger.\\n\\n ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK R. YARGER\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</p><p> Thank you, counsel.\\n \\n\\n\\n The case is submitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\n\\n (Whereupon, at :07 p.m., the case in the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n Five minutes, Mr. Fisher.\\n\\n REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L.

KOVNER\\n\\n FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\\n\\n SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT</p><p> But that's one of\\n\\n the problems here. It may be a good time to alert\\n\\n people who have this bias not to talk about it. It\\n\\n seems to me that's a very hard thing to measure, this\\n\\n \\n39  sort of bias. And, I mean, one question, I guess, is  whether impeaching the verdict in this way will cause  people with biases like that to keep quiet about it and  yet still have the same sort of pernicious effect on the  verdict.</p><p> Well, that's one of\\n\\n the --</p><p> How do you know\\n\\n that?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>Suppose we start with race.  You're not being very helpful to the Court  in your answers.  Suppose we start with race, and the next  case involves religion. Now, how would you distinguish  religion from race if we were to reach an opposite  conclusion in the religious case?</p><p> Well, is it true with\\n\\n respect to other ethnic groups, or only true with\\n\\n respect to Hispanics?</p><p> Well, Mr. Fisher, it's not a  fear of confronting issues down the road. It's a  question of understanding the scope of the rule that you  are asking us to adopt. And I'll give you one last  chance. You will not tell us today whether your rule  applies to discrimination on the basis of -- of religion  or gender or sexual orientation or to add another one,  political affiliation.  So if the jurors -- if it came out the  jurors said this person is a Democrat, send him to jail,  that would be a different result. You will not tell us  whether the same -- whether the rule would apply in  those situations.</p><p> The issue of -- of a capital\\n\\n case could involve all sorts of misconduct in the jury\\n\\n room. So suppose it -- it came out later that the\\n\\n jurors at the penalty phase in the capital case said, we\\n\\n don't really care what the law is. We just want to\\n\\n impose capital punishment, or they flipped a coin.\\n\\n Would you -- if there were a special rule\\n\\n for capital cases. Would you draw the distinction based\\n\\n on race?</p><p> Yeah. How will the judge\\n\\n decide -- how will the judge decide whether the\\n\\n statement is -- is racist?</p><p> But here we have -- in this\\n\\n case, we have a very blatant statement, but let's\\n\\n consider the standard that now applies on a lot of\\n\\n college campuses as to statements that are considered by\\n\\n some people to be racist.\\n\\n What would happen if one of the jurors has\\n\\n the sensibility of a lot of current college students,\\n\\n and thinks that one of the -- something that's said in\\n\\n the jury room that falls into one of those categories\\n\\n was a racious -- was a racial comment?</p><p> -- partial for some other  reason.</p><p> How does that connect with  the right to an impartial jury? A jury can be partial  for racial reasons. It can be -</p><p> How does that -</p><p> Race is -- race is different  for some purposes. But why is it different from other  things for Sixth Amendment purposes? What the Sixth  Amendment protects is the right to a fair trial -- to an  impartial jury. And if we allow the exception that you  are advocating, what do you say to the defendant who - the prisoner who is going to be spending the rest of his  life in prison as a result of the jury verdict that was  determined by flipping a coin?</p><p> Even the first time a person\\n\\n says something that is considered improper on a college\\n\\n campus today and another juror thinks that that shows\\n\\n intentional racial bias.</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>You have to have an answer  for this reason. No one on the other side thinks  anything but this is terrible jury misbehavior. That's  a given across the case. It is not a question of the  validity of the behavior. It's invalid. The question  is the timing of when somebody has to object.  And their point is they have to object  before the verdict comes in. Because if you don't have  that rule, you will, in fact, open the door to all kinds  of evils which they mention. All right? That's their  argument.  So what we're really asking for is your  reply to that argument. And it doesn't really reply to  say maybe you're going to have a bunch of other things  too, 'cause then that strengthens their argument. And  on the other hand, maybe that's what you think. I mean,  the whole question is that inevitably, opening the door\\n \\n to these other things, which will mean tell the jury,\\n\\n\\n\\n Jury, if somebody says a racist comment, write me a\\n\\n note, the judge says, before you reach a verdict.\\n\\n Do you get the point? That's why the\\n\\n question is being asked.</p><p> And so that's why I, too,\\n\\n would like an answer.</p><p> What did the -- what did  the  States do?</p><p> What did the  States do?</p><p> I don't see the problem\\n\\n there. What -- what's actually worrying me about it, if\\n\\n I had to write this on paper, somebody could say, well,\\n\\n you know, on -- on request the defense attorney can get\\n\\n an instruction, send us a note before you reach the\\n\\n \\n jury. That could be happen.\\n\\n\\n\\n But you want to go beyond that and impeach\\n\\n the verdict.\\n\\n The real reason, I suspect, is even though\\n\\n we can imagine cases that are just as unfair, flipping a\\n\\n coin, et cetera, that part of the purpose of these\\n\\n amendments is to create a judicial system that is seen\\n\\n as fair beyond the individual case, and indeed, being\\n\\n seen as fair beyond the individual case means that it is\\n\\n more likely to be fair in other cases as well.\\n\\n Now, if I'm really honest, I think, yeah,\\n\\n that's probably right. And then the history and\\n\\n everything become relevant. But have you found any\\n\\n support for that?</p><p> That what we're doing here\\n\\n in creating the exception, despite the fact that we can\\n\\n think of Justice Alito's case which is just as unfair,\\n\\n though it doesn't involve race, is we're trying to\\n\\n create a fairer system in general and one that will be\\n\\n perceived as such, and there race is a special problem.</p><p> So I wonder if you, and --\\n\\n and I -- if I could write it right, I think it would\\n\\n \\n  make sense, but I'm asking you is there support for such  a thing.</p><p> The reason I think would be  the Sixth Amendment says, in all criminal prosecutions  the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an  impartial jury.  I agree with you that racial comments in the  room can be equivalent to other comments. But there may  be -- that's what I wanted to know, a prophylactic  aspect, that if you want impartial juries in general,  you have to deal with the problem of racial confidence  in the work of the jury. And that's a reason stemming  from the language of the amendment, to treat race  specially, and we have  states that have done so  without the reasons for limitation swamping the process.  Now, that's what I understand is a textural\\n \\n argument, and purposive, that would, in fact, allow\\n\\n47\\n\\n constitutional protection of the kind they're asking\\n\\n for.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Right. But you -- and  specifically what happens next? The Chief asked the  question.</p><p> Do you have to poll -- do  all the jurors have to come back and each one testify?  First of all, did HC say what the two jurors said he  said? There may be doubt about that. And then whether  any of them were influenced by it.</p><p> Does it make any\\n\\n difference if it were not the jurors as here, but the --\\n\\n the lawyer for the defense went around, contacted all\\n\\n the jurors and elicited this testimony? So it wasn't\\n\\n the jurors volunteering, but the lawyer questioning the\\n\\n jurors to see if he can come up with something that\\n\\n would gain a new trial.</p><p> Can you just clarify\\n\\n something? This -- I think Mr. Fisher told -- told us\\n\\n that in the states, whether the -- his number of ,\\n\\n yours of six, is right, that this is limited to race.\\n\\n So it would not be applied to gender, sexual\\n\\n orientation, and apparently, national origin other than\\n\\n Hispanic.</p><p> But there are -- isn't it  so that many lawyers won't ask that question even if  they could? Because just by asking the question, you're  putting race in the minds of the jurors, and you'd\\n \\n rather not do that.\\n\\n38</p><p> Do jurors even know about\\n\\n the existence of a -- a de la rel rule -- rule -- I\\n\\n mean, that jurors can't impeach their verdict?</p><p> Well, when this rule was  first pronounced, they were thinking about quotient  verdicts, coin-flipping, perhaps. And identity bias  didn't figure in back in England when this rule was  first articulated.</p><p> In the states that allow\\n \\n this kind of evidence, is it -- is it all done by\\n\\n52\\n\\n legislation, or by rule -- or by a rule of court? Or\\n\\n has it come about by judicial decision?</p><p> But if I can -- I'm\\n\\n sorry.</p><p> Do jurors --</p><p> Has -- has there been any  case, other than Bolling v. Sharpe? In Bolling v.  Sharpe, the conspicuous absence was any equal protection  principle operative v. the Federal government. And I\\n \\n don't know of any case other than Bolling v. Sharpe\\n\\n\\n\\n where you have that kind of reverse incorporation.</p><p> Isn't it a fact that in\\n \\n  the decisions of this Court, those tiers are not what  they once were; that is, strict scrutiny is no longer  fatal in fact, and for gender discrimination you must  have an exceedingly persuasive justification for it?</p><p> Is it so different?  Suppose somebody in the jury room, say it's an  automobile accident, says, what do you expect of women  drivers? Women shouldn't be allowed to drive cars.  Every woman I know is a terrible driver. Suppose that's  what was said.</p><p> Why isn't this national  origin? I mean, you -- you're trying to isolate race.  But this was a case of a Mexican American. So why  doesn't it belong under national origin rather than  race?</p><p> Well, suppose -</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>I mean, it seems like it's  such on the margins, what you're saying.</p><p> Maybe you could put the  question a little bit differently, because I understand  why you don't want to say, well, it wouldn't apply to  this or it wouldn't apply to that. But in what ways is  race unique?</p><p> It does strike me, though,\\n \\n50  that given that one of the rules is that a juror can,  during deliberations, say something appropriate - something inappropriate is happening here, to the extent  that there is this chilling effect, and more -- why  doesn't that produce the exact same chilling effect?</p><p> Ms. Kovner, and it seems  there are two lines of cases which -- in which we've  recognized that racial bias in a jury room is an  especially important problem, and that there need to be  special rules to address that problem.  And the first line of cases is the ones that  on voir dire say that a lawyer who wants to ask about  racial bias on voir dire has to be able to ask about  racial bias, and that we've applied to nothing else  except for racial bias.  And the second is the Batson line of cases  where we've said we're going to prevent lawyers from  doing what we otherwise allow them to do when striking  jurors will lead to -- may lead to race bias in the jury  room.  Now, here, we have like a screaming race  bias in the jury room. We have the best smoking-gun  evidence you're ever going to see about race bias in the  jury room, and notwithstanding that in these two lines  of cases we've said there need to be special rules to  address this prevalent and toxic problem in our criminal  justice system, here, we're not going to do that.\\n \\n45  And the question is, why would this category  of cases be different from those other two?</p><p> It's just race.  And then Batson would be race and gender; is  that right.</p><p> It's just race you're  saying?</p><p> I'm sorry. Is that -- is  that right?</p><p> Can you -- you keep on being\\n\\n cut off before you get to the tiers of scrutiny, but --\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> -- the cases where the court\\n\\n has said that a lawyer has to be allowed to ask on voir\\n\\n dire about bias, does that -- is that only true of\\n\\n racial bias, or is that true of any other kind of bias\\n\\n as well?</p><p> I think it's --</p><p> Presumably --</p><p> Presumably the judge faces\\n\\n the same situation if a juror comes in during\\n\\n proceedings, is that right, and then the judge has to\\n\\n make whether this is something real or not.</p><p> Mr. Yarger, let's -- let's\\n\\n assume that that's true, that the State interests are\\n\\n \\n basically the same, and also let's assume that the\\n\\n\\n\\n safeguards, voir dire, don't operate particularly\\n\\n differently. All right?\\n\\n So I'll just give you what -- what I think\\n\\n is the strongest argument on Mr. Fisher's side, which is\\n\\n that the -- that the interests in preventing unfairness\\n\\n of this kind are much greater; that that's really the\\n\\n difference, is the fact that verdicts based on race\\n\\n discrimination pose a harm that verdicts based on other\\n\\n kinds of unfairnesses, which exist in the world, and --\\n\\n and are terrible, but still, that it's just not the same\\n\\n kind of harm.</p><p> The one question is whether\\n\\n identity-based harms are different than other kinds of\\n\\n \\n30  unfairnesses, as we've talked about in the Warger case,  for example, or the one before that.  And then another question is whether race - racial bias is different from other identity-based bias,  right? But -- but would you -- would you concede that  identity-based bias is different from like, you know,  the kinds of bias that we've discussed in other cases?</p><p> But it's true that this is a  Sixth Amendment case, but it seems artificial not to  think about the Sixth Amendment issue as informed by the  principles of the Equal Protection Clause. And in those  principles, as we've always understood them, says that  there's a special kind of harm in treating people worse  and, I mean, and certainly, in punishing people because  of their race. And maybe especially because race is so  associated with particular stereotypes respecting  criminality, that that's about the worst thing that you  can do to a person, and it's also the worst thing that  you can suggest about the criminal justice system, that\\n \\n it allows that to happen.\\n\\n31\\n\\n So both of those two things, the harm to the\\n\\n individual for being punished because of your race, and\\n\\n the harm to society writ large. And that would, I\\n\\n think, be the -- the fact, yes, you're right the State\\n\\n interests are exactly the same, and voir dire functions\\n\\n pretty similarly. But it's just a different kind of\\n\\n harm.</p><p> So the idea would be the  judge would say, we'll look at all this other evidence  v. the defendant. I think that they would have found  him guilty regardless.</p><p> But that would be a kind of  structural error.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Can you please tell me,  just as a matter of what goes on in the bar in your  State, in Colorado, particularly, I take it that in  civil cases, lawyers who may be trying a similar case  all the time questioned jurors after the fact, after the  verdict, in order to see how to improve their arguments,  et cetera, et cetera, in civil and criminal cases. Is  this a problem generally?  And a related question: Are there articles  and statistics about the prevalence of this and whether  or not this is disruptive to the legal system?</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Suppose this were a\\n\\n \\n32  capital case. Would the government of the United States  come and make this argument, that the person can be  executed despite what we know happened in the jury room?</p><p> Well, it doesn't follow  from your position.</p><p> So -- so the more  insidious the evil, the less reason we -- the more  caution we should have in -- in inquiring of the jury?\\n \\n49</p><p> By them?</p><p> Like -- like the  government of the State of Colorado, the government of  the United States would make the same argument in a  capital case?</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>So why shouldn't we try\\n\\n to drive it underground?</p><p> Well, why? Isn't -- you  know, there's a lot of talk about political correctness  or not. And some people think it's a negative thing,  and others think it's a positive thing. But if an  individual is harboring racial bias, isn't it better to  harbor it than infect everyone else's deliberations on\\n \\n the basis of it?\\n\\n40\\n\\n I mean, if you're not saying every Mexican\\n\\n commits this kind of crime, but you're forced to argue\\n\\n the evidence to convince your jurors, isn't that exactly\\n\\n what we want?

He says everybody is afraid to open the\\n\\n door. All right? And to the extent that your answer is\\n\\n simply the door is open once you rule for me, 'cause\\n\\n \\n  other bias is going to be viewed the same, it's going to  hurt you. That's what Justice Breyer said. So tell me  why that fear is not valid.</p><p> All right. So why is a\\n\\n rule that says, given the exceptions we've recognized\\n\\n since the 1800s that have said that race is the most\\n\\n pernicious thing in our justice system, why can't we\\n\\n limit this just to race using principles of the\\n\\n Fourteenth Amendment as well?</p><p> Mr. Fisher, why?</p><p> Why?</p><p> Why? I mean, you know,  the Chief says this is not an equal protection case, but  the Sixth Amendment applies to the States through the\\n \\n Fourteenth Amendment; correct?</p><p> I always thought the\\n\\n most pernicious and odious discrimination in our law is\\n\\n based on race.</p><p> Because things do creep  in. We don't make exceptions for those things.</p><p> The problem is it  assumes that if the question is asked that every juror  is going to be truthful. You know, different people can\\n \\n37  have different experiences. But, you know, it is more  rare than common that when a question is asked is anyone  biased that most jurors won't raise their hand.</p><p> The second is very  different from the first.

Now suppose someone, the insider is walking  down the street and sees someone who has a really  unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do\\n \\n  something to make this person's day. And so he provides  the inside information to that person and says, you can  make some money if you trade on this.  Is that a violation?</p><p> Let me give you this example\\n\\n because that -- this goes to that, this.\\n\\n So the person with the inside information\\n\\n has had a few drinks at the country club and is talking\\n\\n to some friends and discloses the inside information\\n\\n to -- to the friends.

I\\'m not worried so much about this case. I a.m. worried  about line drawing, and you want to draw a line so that  friend, relative, doesn\\'t matter, and -- and before I  write those words, I\\'d like to know what circuit courts  have followed that approach?</p><p> It doesn\\'t say it -- it has  a sentence here which is exactly what\\'s hanging me up  and exactly what I thought you were going to answer  before you got cut off.  The sentence is: \"The elements exist also  when an insider makes a gift of confidential information  to a trading relative or friend.\"</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Go ahead.</p><p> I -- well -</p><p> I agree with that. But it  seems to me the analogy is the antitrust laws, very  vague statute. They\\'ve been around a long time.  Exactly what\\'s criminal and what\\'s civil and so forth  has been developed by courts over a long time. This  statute\\'s been around since the \\'30s, and we have courts  developing law in it. And I believe the marketplace  pays a lot of attention to that. And virtually every  court, I think, but this one has held that this does  extend to a tipper giving inside information to a close\\n \\n  relative. And it seems to me -- and I\\'m giving you a  chance to respond to this, that -- suddenly to take the  minority statute here -- or to take the Second Circuit,  is what I\\'m thinking of -- is really more likely to  change the law that people have come to rely upon than  it is to keep to it.  I just want to get your view on that.</p><p> But the difficult part is\\n\\n for a personal advantage, at least to me. And the\\n\\n question is what counts if the tipper gives inside\\n\\n information to a member -- a family member or friend?\\n\\n When is it for a personal advantage, and when is it not\\n\\n for a personal advantage?</p><p> Do we decide?</p><p> So if you know --</p><p> If you give it to your --\\n\\n anyone in the world, and -- whom you happen to know, and\\n\\n you believe that that person will trade on it, that is\\n\\n for a personal advantage.</p><p> Yes?</p><p> What is the personal\\n\\n advantage?</p><p> Okay. So what is the  personal advantage that you received?</p><p> That is a personal  advantage?</p><p> If they did that, why did  they use the word \"advantage\"? The -- you keep going  back to the -- the part that everybody concedes: This  tipper is using information he shouldn\\'t use in a way he  shouldn\\'t use it. Okay? Conceded.  Now, it\\'s the next step of what -- when is  he liable, and what the words are is when he uses it for  a personal advantage. And it sounds to me, as you are  saying -- and you said this -- whenever the tipper knows  that the person, to him, he -- who he gives the  information might well use it to trade.</p><p> What did you say?\\n \\n30</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Uh-huh.</p><p> I mean, the statute\\n\\n doesn\\'t, but there\\'s a long history, and the person\\n\\n who\\'s been defrauded, I take it, or the object of deceit\\n\\n is the company whose information you use. And when you\\n\\n use their information, which you shouldn\\'t, and tell it\\n\\n to someone, you\\'re hurting them. And then there\\'s a\\n\\n subset of cases that we prosecute. And the subset of\\n\\n cases we prosecute are the cases where, having used that\\n\\n information, you use it to benefit yourself.\\n\\n And the question, I take it, is when you use\\n\\n \\n  it to benefit a close family member, is that, in effect,  benefitting yourself. Cecil B. DeMille said -- or maybe  Jack Warner -- rule of relativity: Never hire a  relative. You could have -- you could have that view,  but you also have the view that helping a relative is  helping yourself.  Now, that seems to me where we are in this  case, and the law is filled with instances where they do  seem to think it\\'s the same. And there are a lot of  cases here that think it\\'s about the same, so why isn\\'t  it?</p><p> Do you think it addresses\\n\\n benefits?</p><p> No, no, I realize it\\n\\n doesn\\'t, but I mean, I\\'m looking for the reason why.\\n\\n And of course I can suggest a reason. Because they\\n\\n think very often, though it depends on families, to help\\n\\n a close family member is like helping yourself. That\\'s\\n\\n not true of all families --</p><p> -- but many, it is.</p><p> Why do you say \"scant\"?</p><p> No, my bigger question is\\n\\n why -- why do all the disclosure forms we have to fill\\n\\n out? They have a lot of relatives. You have to put,\\n\\n like, your minor children, your wife. And in giving\\n\\n gifts, you have to disclose your minor children, your\\n\\n wife.\\n\\n I mean, why are the statute books filled\\n\\n with instances where the public wants to know, not just\\n\\n how you might benefit, but how your family might\\n\\n benefit?</p><p> Because --</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Is it -- but the  defendant here is not the insider, and -- and we've been  talking about the two brothers. How far down the line\\n \\n36  do you go? Because Salman is not -- he's a relative by  marriage, but he's -- he's not -- he gets the money  from -- I mean, he gets the tip from the first tippee.</p><p> And Chiarella really  wasn't an insider. He was the printer that -- he had  the information, but he was -- he didn't have any  fiduciary duty to the corporation.</p><p> And why isn't it a\\n\\n benefit, if you said the brother was pestering him so\\n\\n now his brother is happy? He's no longer being\\n\\n pestered. Isn't that a benefit?</p><p> If Dirks is the test, and  it certainly was phrased as a test and that's how Judge  Ray could have understood it, if it is the test, then  this case falls within it because it's a gift, right?</p><p> So what's the difference,\\n\\n if the insider trades and gives it -- makes the proceeds\\n\\n a gift, or if he just says, you do the trade; here's the\\n\\n gift?</p><p> How -- how long does it  continue?</p><p> And so a tip here like  the one we're concerned with, the requirement is that  that tippee know that the information came from a  insider? Is that -</p><p> Had knowledge or  should -- should have known.</p><p> Suppose in this case the\\n \\n person with the inside -- inside information, the\\n\\n\\n\\n brother with the inside information, had himself traded\\n\\n in the securities, and then gave the proceeds to his --\\n\\n what was it? His older brother? Would that have\\n\\n violated (b)?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>-- he thinks there -- I\\n\\n mean, he thinks there would be? Is it as strong as\\n\\n that?</p><p> Is anticipated the same as\\n\\n he knew he would?</p><p> But it\\'s not enough. It\\'s\\n\\n like, well, I think he might or --</p><p> -- or, you know, I\\'m sort of\\n\\n \\n betting that he would, but I don\\'t really know.\\n\\n39</p><p> Mr. Dreeben, I get your --\\n\\n your theory and why it doesn\\'t make any particular\\n\\n difference. And indeed, in that same paragraph where\\n\\n the Court says relatives or friends, the Court, just a\\n\\n sentence before, just talks about an intention to\\n\\n benefit a recipient --</p><p> -- without any sense of who\\n\\n that recipient has to be.\\n\\n On the other hand, as you say, almost all of\\n\\n these cases are relatives and friends.</p><p> And things might look\\n\\n different if we had a case that was not a relative or\\n\\n friend. And why not separate out that strange, unusual,\\n\\n hardly-ever-prosecuted situation and say we\\'re not\\n\\n dealing with that here? We have nothing to say about\\n\\n it.</p><p> So is -- is that something\\n\\n more than he thinks there could be --</p><p> That there would be trading.</p><p> Let\\'s look at -- on the\\n\\n other side, if you think about the tipper now. You\\'ve\\n\\n used a couple of times the phrase \"knowledge\" or\\n\\n \"anticipation.\"</p><p> I think what I\\'m suggesting\\n\\n by the hypothetical is that we all have our own\\n\\n interests and purposes behind giving gifts. Some of\\n\\n those might be very practical and pragmatic. Some of\\n\\n them might be more altruistic. But we give gifts for\\n\\n individual interests and purposes.\\n\\n And here, I\\'m stealing corporate\\n\\n information. It\\'s essentially a kind of embezzlement or\\n\\n \\n  conversion. I\\'m stealing information to give a gift to  somebody I know. It might be, as in this case, a family  member. It might be a friend. And I benefit from that  because -- I mean, it\\'s the -- I personally benefit.  It\\'s the exact opposite of using corporate information  for corporate purposes. I\\'m using it for my own  personal purposes.</p><p> No, I wasn\\'t suggesting that\\n\\n there was -- there are easy answers to the question of\\n\\n what contributes to the integrity of the market. I was\\n\\n suggesting that it\\'s a reason for caution in changing a\\n\\n 30-year-old rule that everybody has understood and lived\\n\\n by, and that -- that Congress has shown no indication\\n\\n it\\'s unhappy with.</p><p> Ms. Shapiro, here is not a  question of expanding it further. You\\'re asking us to  cut back significantly from something that we said  several decades ago, something that Congress has shown  no indication that it\\'s unhappy with, and in a context  in which, I mean, obviously the integrity of the markets  are a very important thing for this country. And you\\'re  asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that  threatens that integrity.</p><p> Yes, you have. And why\\n\\n should the issue be any different if, instead of\\n\\n stealing the hundred dollar bill off my coworker\\'s desk,\\n\\n I instead steal information and give the gift of that\\n\\n information rather than give a gift of cash?</p><p> Ms. Shapiro, let me give you\\n\\n a hypothetical. Let\\'s suppose I would like to give a\\n\\n gift to a friend of mine, but it\\'s just too expensive\\n\\n for me to give it. And then I pass a coworker\\'s desk,\\n\\n and I see a hundred dollar bill sitting there, and I\\n\\n take the hundred dollar bill; and now I can give a gift\\n\\n \\n that I had wanted to give, but I couldn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n\\n Now, have I benefitted from stealing the\\n\\n hundred dollar bill?</p><p> More than mention. This is  like half their holding.</p><p> Ms. Shapiro, you\\'re asking  us to ignore some extremely specific language in Dirks,  which of course, was decided quite some time ago. So  I\\'m just going read in Dirks.  The Court is talking about when it would be  proper under the statute to convict somebody for insider  trading, it\\'s because there might be a relationship  between the insider and the recipient, or an intention\\n \\n  to benefit the particular recipient. And then it goes  on to say, \"When an insider makes a gift of confidential  information to a trading relative or friend,\" and then  in the last paragraph of the opinion, where it\\'s really  summing up everything that it\\'s done, the Court says,  \"The tippers received no monetary or personal benefit,  nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable  information to the tippee.\"  So there\\'s a lot of language in Dirks which  is very specific about, it\\'s not only when there\\'s a  quid pro quo from the tippee to the tipper, but when the  tipper makes a gift to the tippee, and in particular a  relative or friend.</p><p> I don\\'t know what  \"dictum\" -- what \"dictum\" means. The court is very\\n \\n  clearly setting out a test here. And this is part of  the test.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>But that -- that addresses  whether or not there\\'s an initial breach. Here, we  assume there\\'s an initial breach. The question is: How  far out does liability extend? And it seems to me that  what you\\'re saying doesn\\'t quite address the problem  we\\'re discussing.</p><p> Isn\\'t it something of a\\n\\n stretch to say that the circumstance you describe more\\n\\n widespread on dissemination are all gifts?</p><p> It ennobles you, and in a\\n\\n sense it -- it helps you financially because you make\\n\\n them more secure.</p><p> Except, as Justice Breyer  points out, you certainly benefit from giving to your</p><p> Justice Ginsburg was\\n\\n setting up the question, isn\\'t he -- in -- in her\\n\\n instance where the tippee does the trading, the tippee\\n\\n is just an accomplice. This is standard accomplice\\n\\n stuff.</p><p> And it\\'s certainly not  dictum in Dirks when the Court says, \"Thus, the test is  whether the insider personally will benefit directly or  indirectly from his disclosure.\"</p><p> We\\'re talking about  benefit and personal gain. And Dirks says there\\'s a  benefit in making a gift. Now, it\\'s -- it\\'s true in the  law of gifts, we don\\'t generally talk about benefit to  the donor -- I can -- other than in gift tax, but that\\'s  for different reasons.</p>', 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>Wait a minute. First of  all, that's no longer true. There's regulations that  stop that, talking to analysts.  But talk about the culpability question.  Why is it any less culpable to give your close relative,  who you've been supporting every month for your entire  life, so instead of giving him, one month or two months,  that regular one hundred dollar bill, you choose to give  him corporate information. That's Justice Kagan's  example.\\n \\n  Why is that person more culpable than the  person who just -- a relative comes and says, it would  be nice; I need some money. And you give him a tip  instead of the cash.</p><p> That's true, but then  comes the government's suggestion that the disclosure  has to be for a personal benefit or a personal purpose,  that there has to be a reason you're doing it, not  accidentally, not -- not unknowingly, but something  you're doing because you want to receive some benefit  from it.</p><p> Don't you think that his\\n \\n  brother's statement -- when he was asked about trading  by Maher, the younger brother, he said, I owe somebody  money. Isn't that most naturally read to be either give  me the money to pay this person back or give me  information that lets me pay him back? Isn't that  always the quid pro quo of a gift, that you believe that  if you give someone a gift, it's going to cost you one  way or another?  You're going to give them something of  value, or you're going to substitute money for the gift,  or you're going to do something that saves you money by  giving the tip.</p><p> But Congress doesn't  define what's deceptive or manipulative or -- what's the  third word? -- what defrauds. It has general words.  Don't devise a scheme that does these things. The law  has for ages said that the failure to -- to speak when  you're obligated to; i.e., an insider who doesn't  disclose that he's using your information is an omission  that's been, classically, a fraud.  So I don't understand why you keep saying  that the law doesn't define this.</p><p> If we disagree with you\\n\\n because of the gift language of Dirks, how else could\\n\\n you suggest to limit liability? What other ways are\\n\\n there to take care of someone who -- closer cases that\\n\\n exist? Lisser has given us one proposal. What's yours?\\n\\n Besides the fact it has to be a tangible benefit.</p><p> Mr. Dreeben, I'm -- I'm  not sure that your solution is going to clarify much of  this area, because now I think the fight is going to be  over what was the reason that the tipper gave for giving  the tip.  I mean, in this very case, there were three  reasons for breaching the rule of confidentiality. The  first, to -- for Maher to become more knowledgeable of  the health care industry. Under your reading, if he had  no knowledge his brother would trade, that was not  actionable; correct?\\n \\n34</p><p> No. I'm talking about  that there are three examples of breaching  confidentiality.  The first was to -- for him to become more  knowledgeable of the health industry.  The second was to help the father with his  medical care.  And the third, the one you charged, was the  giving of information, knowing that his brother was  going to trade on it.  How do you draw the line among those three?  All three were for personal reasons.</p><p> So you have -</p><p> So if all he did it for  was to get information for his father, had no idea that\\n \\n35  his brother was trading, he would not be liable and his  brother wouldn't be liable.</p><p> So why do you want to\\n\\n put knowledge of the -- knowledge that it will be used\\n\\n for trading as part of the breach of fiduciary duty? If\\n\\n you do that, then you have to prove that the tippee knew\\n\\n that the tipper thought it would be traded.</p><p> Why can't you put it in\\n\\n the intent to defraud?</p><p> So why -- why make it\\n\\n part of the breach --</p><p> Mr. Dreeben, I think\\n \\n you're taking this way out of existing law. Are you\\n\\n45\\n\\n going to suggest that tippees aren't routinely\\n\\n prosecuted when tippers don't know that they are going\\n\\n to trade? I think they are, and most often it's because\\n\\n you claim that they should have known it was\\n\\n confidential information.</p><p> There's plenty --\\n\\n there's a legion of cases I read for this -- preparing\\n\\n for this argument where the government has said --</p><p> Except your defining\\n\\n limit? It has to be tangible?</p><p> So you're going to let\\n\\n go of the guy that Justice Alito -- the guy on the\\n\\n street who looks dejected is not my friend or a close\\n\\n relative, but I give him a tip and say, go trade on\\n\\n this. It will make you a lot of money.\\n\\n \\n46  That person -- that tipper would not be  liable.</p><p> So is there a difference  between friend and acquaintance, as you're talking?  Tell me.</p><p> Is recklessness used?</p><p> So it's irrelevant  whether it's a friend or family member?</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n The case is submitted.\\n\\n (Whereupon, at :05 a.m., the case in the\\n\\n above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> Two minutes,\\n\\n Ms. Spinelli.\\n\\n \\n63  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p><p> Thank you, counsel.</p><p> If -- if we are\\n\\n concerned about how extraordinary the extraordinary\\n\\n circumstances are -- in other words, your position looks\\n\\n more reasonable the tighter the extraordinariness\\n\\n requirement is -- what -- what type of language would\\n\\n you require -- I mean, you're saying, oh, well, just say\\n\\n you can do this and then it will work out over time how\\n\\n extraordinary it is.\\n\\n But what would you say if you want -- if you\\n\\n felt an obligation to tighten the extraordinary\\n\\n requirement?</p><p> Right, but if we are\\n\\n concerned about --</p><p> I'm sorry.

Something strange seems to have happened  between the petition stage and the briefing stage in the  case.  The question that you asked us to take was  whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the  distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that  violates the statutory priority scheme. And you said  there\\'s a square conflict on that issue, with the Second  Circuit and the Third Circuit on one side and the Fifth  Circuit on the other side.</p><p> But can you point to  anything you said in the Third Circuit, in writing or  orally, that -- along those lines, that you -- that  there was some practical course of action that -- that  you -- some tangible thing that you were going to  pursue?</p><p> If you were pressed as to  what practical difference the case meant to you and - and the answer was, we -- you know, we want to uphold  the law.</p><p> Well, in the Third Circuit  oral argument, it was said over and over, well, we just  want to make sure that the law is filed -- is followed.  That\\'s what we are interested in.  Isn\\'t that right?</p><p> There is a difference --\\n\\n there seems to be a difference between what you have\\n\\n \\n  said on this point in your briefs and in your argument  this morning and what you told the Third Circuit or what  -- did you -- did your firm represent -- appear in the  Third Circuit?</p><p> And we took the case.

But you are asking us to decide  whether the priorities have to be followed in a  structural dismissal, and unless the answer to that  question follows from the answer to the question that  you presented in your petition, you have changed the  question that you have asked us to decide.</p><p> So those are just exception\\n\\n provisions?</p><p> What is your response to the\\n\\n argument that your argument regarding Section 103(a)\\n\\n makes the provisions that specifically make the\\n\\n priorities applicable in Chapter  and Chapter \\n\\n superfluous?</p><p> What --</p><p> There is nothing in the Code  that says that they have to.</p><p> There is another logically  prior question.

I -- clarify a basic misunderstanding on my  part. What's a structured settlement?</p><p> Why not just call it a  settlement?</p><p> Let's call it a settlement.</p><p> I'm not talking about this  case. I just want the background in my mind.</p><p> What happens?\\n\\n \\n35</p><p> But suppose they had\\n\\n settled it for a dollar, and one of the creditors says,\\n\\n this is all corrupt. I'm not saying they did in this\\n\\n case. But, I mean, wouldn't -- wouldn't -- there's an\\n\\n asset of the estate. They bring a lawsuit. They reach\\n\\n a settlement. Suppose it's a totally crooked\\n\\n settlement.</p><p> Ah.</p><p> Exactly. So what forbids  it? You started out by saying there is nothing in the  Code that permits this kind of settlement, which in fact  leaves out -- if -- it gives some money to lower-ranking  creditors without giving them to your client.  I think you're right. I don't see anything  permits it. The problem: What forbids it?</p><p> The structure of the  Code -</p><p> -- forbids it.</p><p> You'd presumably qualify\\n\\n that with the statutory provision that was just\\n\\n mentioned, and my guess was you want to qualify that as\\n\\n well with the -- with this emergency creditor, you know,\\n\\n where you're going to sink the -- the person who has a\\n\\n prepetition was just discussed.</p><p> Yeah. All right. All - that's all I wanted to know.

(Laughter.)</p><p> I don't see what this has  to do with that. But my problem is quite simple. What  was -- this is not your asset -</p><p> All right. So there is an  asset of an estate.</p><p> It's a claim against a  third party.</p><p> Very well.</p><p> And now there is a person,  probably the trustee or a committee, that's going to  pursue that claim.</p><p> Then the claim is settled.</p><p> Now, at least on request\\n \\n\\n when you're in Chapter , doesn't the judge, the\\n\\n34\\n\\n bankruptcy judge, have to approve that settlement?</p><p> No? Why not?</p><p> -- that's -- this is - this is an asset of the estate?</p><p> See? But there is somebody  down there who has it. He says, give it to me; it's  ours. He says, I'll give it to you, but I want you to  use it to pay my friend who happens to be my cousin, who  is the 19th ranked creditor.</p><p> By the way, if you want me  to, I will make up my hypothetical so that giving half  the gold to this person is just as wonderful as you  would like, and I will also change the hypothetical  around, if you could do or I could do, so that not  giving the money to this person would be just terrible.</p><p> Right.</p><p> -- can you settle it on\\n\\n terms that will, in fact, take these assets that belong\\n\\n to the company and distribute them in a way that is\\n\\n \\n\\n contrary to , , , , ?\\n\\n62</p><p> It says nothing about what\\n\\n the terms are. It says nothing about what the\\n\\n settlement is. And the question for us, I guess, is, in\\n\\n those words, which make no reference to it --</p><p> The Earth will come to an  end. So the question is, do you think Congress gave to  the trustee or to you or to somebody else the power to  deviate with Jean LaFitte's gold or with these\\n \\n43  particular -- this particular set of money or any other  set of money?</p><p> It seems to me a dangerous  principle to get into, but if you can tell me or that  normally happens, I'm open to -</p><p> Well, this 363(b) -- is  there -- I mean, this -- you would -- they say -- you're  just saying they did it the wrong way when they reached  the settlement; then this -- the -- the Petitioners here  should have gone to the bankruptcy judge and said,  Judge, you know, there is an odd thing about this  settlement. They're not only paying in $ million or  whatever, but they want to tell you how to distribute  it.</p><p> And they want to tell you  how to distribute it, and we want you to distribute it  according to the rules, and not according to what they  say.\\n \\n50  That's what you say they should have done.</p><p> Well, if that's what they  did do, what's the problem?</p><p> And then you're saying they  have discretion there.</p><p> So the question is: Do  they have discretion -</p><p> And as long as you give the  majority to him, okay, then you can give the rest to the  others.  All right. Now, that would seem to be a  possibility at least from your argument in this case.</p><p> -- to depart from -- okay.  I got it.</p><p> Over the objection of one  of the creditors.</p><p> Okay. That's helpful.\\n \\n51</p><p> Oh, well, once -- then I'm  back with Justice Kagan. I'm pretty worried about that  provision.</p><p> And the reason I'm worried  about it is -- and you'll be worried about it, all you  have to do is represent some client or represent some - a bank, for example, that thinks it has secured - thinks it has a secured interest in something, and lo  and behold, there is a $40 billion settlement, and they  make it conditional that the money go to the widows and  orphans -</p><p> -- so we reverse it here,  and then the -</p><p> Yeah.\\n \\n52</p><p> What the Code in 363(b)\\n\\n says is the trustee can sell a suit.

Let\\'s just assume  that you are right, that -- that this is one of these  extraordinary circumstances in which some people can be  made better off and nobody will be made worse off.  Still the question is, where is the authorization for  that in the Bankruptcy Code? Because that\\'s like a big  principle. I mean -- and I think we would have known  about it if that\\'s the way bankruptcy proceedings were  supposed to go. And -- and you suggest while it\\'s in  this \"for cause\" language, but this \"for cause\"  language, I mean, this is a pretty specific provision  that we\\'re talking about.  What it says is that when you can\\'t reach a  plan and the case has to be dismissed, this is attached\\n \\n\\n to a provision that says everything has to be rolled\\n\\n48\\n\\n back.</p><p> But, Mr. Landau -</p><p> The question is whether  Congress did enact it and what you can point to in the  Bankruptcy Code that suggests that the continual  statement that it\\'s just one, two, three, four, five is  subject to a kind of equitable exception for  Pareto-superior outcomes.</p><p> -- for Congress to have  enacted.</p><p> -- if there is such a  solution, you can go with that. And that might be a  completely sensible bankruptcy provision -</p><p> That\\'s one Bankruptcy Code.  Here\\'s another Bankruptcy Code: It says  presumptively, you have to follow one, two, three, four,  five, but if there is a Pareto-superior solution, in  other words, a solution in which some people are made  off and nobody -- in which some people are -- get better  outcomes and nobody gets a worse outcome -</p><p> That\\'s -- and that\\'s it.  You just have to follow that order.</p><p> -- Mr. Ernest, sort of a  similar question. You -- here\\'s two different kinds of  bankruptcy schemes. One scheme just says every time you  distribute assets, you have to follow the following  order: one, two, three, four, five.</p><p> Let me ask you -</p><p> So a settlement that is a --\\n\\n a -- that -- that distributes protest -- proceeds.</p><p> All settlements?

Do you see a difference between the question  presented that talked about the absolute priority rule  as it relates to settlement proceeds and the \"structured  dismissal\" here.</p><p> Well, I -- I -- it goes  to a more fundamental question, which is, is there a  difference or in our ruling whether we say no settlement  proceeds can be distributed in violation of the absolute  priority rule from a statement that no dismissal,  structured dismissal, can be entered in violation of the\\n \\n\\n absolute priority rule.</p><p> I do think there is a\\n\\n difference.</p><p> Why does Sun Life care?</p><p> No, the settlement would\\n\\n have been the one that occurred.</p><p> If it --\\n\\n59</p><p> So do you think they can\\n\\n still sue you for those fraudulent conveyance claims?</p><p> Not you; Sun Life.</p><p> The fraudulent-transfer\\n\\n claim?</p><p> You don\\'t understand.\\n\\n My basic question was --</p><p> -- what did Sun Life\\n\\n care if the fraudulent conveyance claim was going to be\\n\\n resolved and released?</p><p> Why does it care?</p><p> Why did it care to\\n\\n exclude these truck drivers from receiving whatever they\\n\\n demanded?</p><p> But that eventually --\\n\\n you had already --</p><p> But why?</p><p> -- me why Sun Life --\\n\\n Sun Life cared?\\n\\n If it got its settlement -- i.e., it was\\n\\n going to pay $ million and get all the claims against\\n\\n it released -- what was its reason for not wanting the\\n\\n proceeds to be distributed according to the absolute\\n\\n priority rule?</p><p> But I don\\'t understand  how you get to an extraordinary circumstance in that - in this situation. It seems to me that wanting to  exclude the claims of one or more creditors is the  ordinary situation. Every junior creditor wants money.  They\\'re happy to exclude anybody they can -</p><p> -- or anybody who will  concede to doing it.</p><p> Well, I\\'m -- I\\'m sorry.\\n\\n Does this mean that the junior creditors wouldn\\'t have\\n\\n agreed to this settlement because the senior creditors\\n\\n could have?

And then at the end, to deal with the problem\\n\\n you're -- you're -- you're raising, we say that it has\\n\\n to be a strong basis in evidence. That's because you\\n\\n don't want to put the district court in a position, and\\n\\n the legislature, to do the impossible, right?\\n\\n So it tries to do that. That is the\\n\\n decision of the Court. I had thought, that having done\\n\\n that, there would be lots of lower courts that would\\n\\n rely on that decision.\\n\\n Is it a good idea now suddenly to change and\\n\\n go to some different test?\\n\\n \\n33</p><p> Right, correct, exactly.  It's predominant. And then it has the two paragraphs  that I've talked about, which are meant to illustrate  what that predominance means. And they are pretty much  what -- I think pretty much what you said.</p><p> Pretty much.</p><p> Let's talk about 71.</p><p> Now, I have a particular  question on 71. Remember what I was trying do.</p><p> At least in Alabama.  The -- the Court's cases, at that moment,  pre-Alabama, I -- I'm one of the problems. Okay?  So I am trying to reflect what is actually  there in Miller, for better or for worse, and to make it  clear.  The column I've referred to talks really  about evidence showing predominance. Does it or doesn't  it? And there are two things there that are crucial in  that -- I think, in those two paragraphs. One, there  was direct evidence that they moved 70 -- or 50,000 - ,000 people are all black. Okay?  Two, when you look at the three districting  traditional criteria, they are pretty weak as applicable  to that case. They just seem not to have much relevance  to what they are talking about.</p><p> Now, let's look at 71.\\n\\n Same kind of thing they are arguing. Same kind of\\n\\n thing. They moved -- I don't know, you have it in the\\n\\n SG's brief too. They moved ,293 people out and ,000\\n\\n in. So let's look at those people. The ones they moved\\n\\n out were three-quarters or something white, and the ones\\n\\n they moved in were three-quarters or something black.\\n\\n So that's pretty similar. It seems to me they paid a\\n\\n lot of attention to race.\\n\\n Then they say, let's look at the traditional\\n\\n criteria. The one they mentioned, which is this horn\\n\\n thing, they said that they -- they did it to keep it\\n\\n preserved Richmond centered. But it already changed it\\n\\n so it wasn't Richmond centered at all, and the changes\\n\\n had nothing do with it.\\n\\n So what they are saying is in that case,\\n\\n look at that specificity, and you will see that the\\n\\n mistake of the judge in listing the criteria, you know,\\n\\n his statement, overly broad or whatever, made a\\n\\n difference, send it back, get him to do it right.\\n\\n Now, that's a long question, but that's\\n\\n designed to focus you.</p><p> Okay.</p><p> You saw the  -- ,785.  That's pretty strong.</p><p> No. What is the evidence  that you say would show that, in fact, they did use  race? What's your strongest one or two pieces of  evidence?</p><p> It makes a point of that in\\n\\n the opinion, and that -- that that's meant to guide the\\n\\n district judges. And so what -- what's the equivalent\\n\\n here? What's the equivalent if -- assuming he didn't\\n\\n say exactly the right words, no one can say exactly the\\n\\n right words, what's his mistake?</p><p> That's -- that's what I\\n\\n have to do after this argument, isn't it? I mean, you\\n\\n gave me exactly what I needed. You -- you gave me the\\n\\n things to look up. He gave me the things on the other\\n\\n side, and -- and they -- they didn't use exactly the\\n\\n right test, but does it matter?\\n\\n And -- and -- and I -- I think the -- the\\n\\n reason I approach it that way is because this is such\\n\\n a -- the reasons you said. Okay. You have to give\\n\\n leeway here; leeway, leeway.\\n\\n But the government makes a pretty good point\\n\\n here that it -- that really was important evidence he\\n\\n didn't look at. And -- and that's -- that's my job,\\n\\n isn't it, to go back and read these things and figure\\n\\n out how they -- the -- the evidence.</p><p> What -- what is your\\n\\n evidence of that? I mean, look, which I'm sure you've\\n\\n read, in -- in the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus,\\n\\n which I had hopped would end these cases in this Court,\\n\\n which it certainly doesn't seem to have done -- all\\n\\n right? But if you make the comparison, it isn't enough,\\n\\n I don't think, for you to say that they just saw some\\n\\n traditional factors; and they didn't take into account\\n\\n other evidence that they were using race predominantly.\\n\\n Well, if you look at the other evidence on\\n\\n page 1271, you know, the west thing, it was pretty\\n\\n strong evidence. They added ,785 new voters; and of\\n\\n those, precisely  were white. Right?</p><p> Now, is there -- and when\\n\\n you looked at their use of the factors, of the\\n\\n traditional factors, they were pretty irrelevant.</p><p> You make a point of that.</p><p> I mean, I think I heard\\n\\n the -- Mr. Clement say that, well, no, this has all been\\n\\n brought up after the case was over, and --</p><p> You called it to the\\n\\n attention --</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>So are you proposing that  we remand, we tell the district court, you applied the  wrong standard, and that the right standard is race can  predominate, even if there's no distortion of the shape  of the district?

All right?\\n\\n So -- but -- but as I understand your\\n\\n argument, you're not resting your case on that fact\\n\\n alone; is that correct?</p><p> Even -- even if we concede  that there were -- you know, essentially, all the  African-Americans were moved in and all the -- the - the whites were moved out. It's -</p><p> So we really are looking to  what Justice Breyer suggested, which is, we're -- we're  looking to the movement of voters in and out of a  particular district?</p><p> So are those --</p><p> And those districts are?</p><p> But a strong case that it  would change?</p><p> May I ask, Mr. - Mr. Gornstein, the -- the same question I asked  Mr. Elias. If we did vacate this on the grounds that  that's the correct standard, what you just said, and  that is not the standard that the district court used,  what do you think would happen? You know, if -- if the  standard that you just stated was fairly applied, would  anything change?</p><p> When, then, can you? What\\n\\n \\n  would be a case in which that might be possible? Not  theoretically possible, but you can imagine it  happening?</p><p> Are these the only kind of\\n\\n districts where you would say that a target would not\\n\\n have an impact on district lines? In other words, where\\n\\n the district has a population that's so far above the\\n\\n target that nothing that they're doing on the margins is\\n\\n affected by the target, are those the only kind?</p><p> I thought, Mr. Clement, that  the -- the 55 percent was based on a single district,  75; and that they said, okay, we've looked at 75. You  need 55 percent there. And then it was applied across  the board to every other majority-minority district  without any granular analysis.</p><p> Isn't there something a bit  strange about this kind of rule? And it's not to say  that this kind of rule is the end all and be all.\\n \\n37  You -- it might be that you can have this rule and still  be absolutely fine in the way that Mr. Gornstein  suggested. But the idea that you would look at   districts and say that every single one of them ought to  meet the same BVAP standard without looking at the  characteristics of those districts, who's in them, how  they vote, I mean, it just -- it sort of defies belief  you could pick a number and say that applies with  respect to every majority-minority district.</p><p> Well, it's more than a\\n\\n theoretical possibility. And Mr. Gornstein says -- and\\n\\n he seems to be pretty sensitive to the idea of giving\\n\\n States latitude. But he looks at this and says, this\\n\\n standard actually did make a difference on the ground,\\n\\n that there were districts kicked out and said, oh, this\\n\\n isn't race-based because it looks good, even though it\\n\\n was race-based.</p><p> I think the -- the real\\n\\n difference between your standard and the SG's standard\\n\\n is that in your standard, the shape of a district\\n\\n functions as a threshold inquiry such that if the shape\\n\\n is okay, we don't look at anything else, and\\n\\n particularly we don't look even if the districting was\\n\\n \\n54  completely race-based in motive. And that's just what  the -- that three-part test does. It sets up a  threshold inquiry about -- about how the district is  shaped in a way that some people thought Shaw was when  Shaw was first announced and that this Court in one,  two, three subsequent cases made clear it wasn't.</p><p> You absolutely don't,\\n\\n Mr. Clement. But it's one thing for a legislature to\\n\\n say, we view it as a core priority up there with\\n\\n one-person, one-vote to comply with the Voting Rights\\n\\n Act. That's a terrific thing. It's another thing for\\n\\n the legislature to do what it did, for example, in the\\n\\n Alabama case, which is to just say something about there\\n\\n \\n\\n can't be any retrogression from whatever there is,\\n\\n50\\n\\n notwithstanding that that's just not Section  law, and,\\n\\n similarly, it's another thing for the legislature to\\n\\n just pick a number out of one district, apply it to all\\n\\n  districts, and say that that's compliance with the\\n\\n Voting Rights Act.\\n\\n Now, I agree with you and with Mr. Elias and\\n\\n with Mr. Gornstein: That does not get you all the way\\n\\n there. But there's something about -- this is --\\n\\n Alabama suggested this was evidence. When a State says\\n\\n across the board we're going to do something that just\\n\\n on its face you know is not required by the Voting\\n\\n Rights Act, that's a problem.</p><p> Well, then I'm with  Justice Breyer, who suggested that a few years ago we  took those concerns into account and we tried to figure  out a test that was responsive to those concerns, and  that is not the test that the district court used here.</p><p> If you look at Shaw and\\n\\n Shaw II and you look at Miller, and then you think about\\n\\n the -- the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you,\\n\\n which is essentially -- maybe I'll change it a little\\n\\n bit -- it's essentially a mapmaker who says, look, we\\n\\n really want to do race-based districting here. We can\\n\\n manage to do this in a way where the maps look kind of\\n\\n contiguous and kind of regularly shaped, but what we're\\n\\n doing is race-based decision making.\\n\\n Now, it seems pretty clear to me that if you\\n\\n look at Shaw II, if you look at Miller, that's\\n\\n forbidden. And -- and -- and that's exactly the\\n\\n opposite of what the district court said here.\\n\\n \\n45</p><p> Just -- yeah, no, just going\\n\\n \\n\\n back to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems pretty\\n\\n44\\n\\n clear to me that in the cases after Shaw -- because\\n\\n Shaw, you could have looked at it as, this is all about\\n\\n the way the district looks, and then in the cases after\\n\\n Shaw, in Shaw II, and in Miller, the Court makes very\\n\\n clear that it's not all about the way the district\\n\\n looks, and indeed --</p><p> No, please.</p><p> But, Mr. Clement --</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>But -- but as to 75, did\\n\\n he not say that strict scrutiny was met, because other\\n\\n legitimate and -- and conventional factors were\\n\\n considered and were present?</p><p> It seems to me that 75 is\\n\\n the -- is the strongest case for the district court.</p><p> Suppose you have two  district -- or two possible districts. Each of them  look conventional. Each of them are conventional in the  same sense that you've been describing these multiple\\n \\n\\n factors.\\n\\n41\\n\\n But the stated reason, the stipulated reason\\n\\n for choosing District A over District B is because it\\n\\n has more voters of a certain race, black, Latino, white,\\n\\n whatever. Is that a predominant motive based on race?</p><p> That -- and that's what\\n\\n the district court says, and I have -- I have problems\\n\\n with that, because predominance is designed to measure\\n\\n intent when there are multiple causes, and in my -- in\\n\\n my hypothetical, the hypothetical is, the -- the -- the\\n\\n tipping point, the principal motivating factor was race.\\n\\n And you say that because -- and the district court I\\n\\n think said because the districts are conventional in all\\n\\n other respects, strict scrutiny doesn't apply.

You rely heavily  on (b)(), but it doesn\\'t even seem to apply by its  terms.  It says, \"Notice of appeal filed after the  court announces a decision, sentence or order, but  before the entry of judgment.\"  And that would not seem to apply to a  situation here. This wasn\\'t before the entry of  judgment, the appeal of the restitution part. It was - it was after.</p><p> No, no. I know they\\n\\n can\\'t. Here, the question is whether you\\'re going to\\n\\n add anything at all. I mean, obviously, if the\\n\\n restitution amount hasn\\'t been entered, you can\\'t\\n\\n challenge the amount. But they don\\'t know in the court\\n\\n \\n  of appeals: Well, is he going to file another notice of  appeal? I guess we have to hold this in abeyance. And  then you hold it in abeyance, and who knows for how  long, because it doesn\\'t actually have to be within the  90 days. It just seems to me a very confusing system.</p><p> I\\'m not challenging\\n\\n your reading of the case, but, I mean, that\\'s a very\\n\\n unusual type of approach when it comes to jurisdictional\\n\\n rules, you know, final enough, you know, and then you\\n\\n get other cases, are they final -- like this one: Is\\n\\n this final enough or not. It just seems to me we would\\n\\n be better served by a simple rule.\\n\\n And even the rule -- well, if you can do two\\n\\n different things, that means the court gave a notice of\\n\\n appeal from the original judgment and they don\\'t know --\\n\\n they don\\'t necessarily know if there\\'s going to be\\n\\n anything more, right? The restitution may be\\n\\n insignificant enough that you don\\'t feel it\\'s worth\\n\\n adding that to the appeal issues, any number of things.\\n\\n So I don\\'t see how they know should we hold onto this or\\n\\n not hold onto it.</p><p> And you say you can\\n\\n appeal that, even though it\\'s not complete. And then\\n\\n later on, you can appeal either the part that fills it\\n\\n in, or the whole thing. It seems to me that usually if\\n\\n things are -- they\\'re either final or not, and if they\\n\\n are not, you can\\'t appeal; and if they are, you can.</p><p> Well, it --\\n\\n conceptually, at least, that seems odd.

(Whereupon, at :53 p.m., the case in the  above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>Well, right. But Justice  Sotomayor's question was, why not? The virtue of having  two notices of appeal, it's definite, a certain time,  people know what to do. When you have one notice of  appeal and then maybe you're going to add a few  arguments later, did you -- did they have a fair chance  to answer? What is that later time? It raises a lot of  questions.  So the simplest thing with a rule, and it  doesn't hurt anybody, is what I think she was  suggesting: Just follow what the government says there.  You appeal, then you appeal.</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> But the rule says -</p><p> You're just being literal\\n\\n in the rule. The rule says in a criminal case, a\\n\\n defendant's notice of appeal must be filed within \\n\\n days of the order being appealed from. That's one of\\n\\n the things -- and you're appealing from the order which\\n\\n says, pay so much.</p><p> From the judgment. So we\\n\\n have a judgment which says -- judgment says, and it\\n\\n leaves restitution open. Then we have another judgment\\n\\n which is -- says how much the amount is. I mean, that's\\n\\n so simple, and all the lawyers would understand it, and\\n\\n the other seems more complicated.\\n\\n Now, what's your response to that?</p><p> Dolan didn't --</p><p> I know whether it answered\\n\\n the question. But in one second, I'm going to conclude\\n\\n that you don't have a reason, other than I would read\\n\\n \\n the text. Your reason is if the text literally\\n\\n\\n\\n requires -- doesn't require it, then it doesn't.\\n\\n But do you have any answer other than that?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>But there might not be an  appeal when the defendant knows what the amount is. If  the amount is small, defendant might not appeal. So we  don\\'t -- we don\\'t know at the point where there\\'s just a  blank whether the defendant is going to appeal -- appeal  the amount.</p><p> But the bottom line was  summary judgment. Here, no -- no amount of restitution  has been determined.</p><p> What about (c), which  requires the notice of appeal to designate the judgment  order or part thereof being appealed? So a notice of  appeal can\\'t designate an order that has not yet been  made.</p><p> But here, in fact, when  the restitution judgment was entered, the clerk of the  district court sent that order to the court of appeals.  So it was an amended judgment that was sent.  The -- the clerk of the court treated it as  though it were an amendment to the judgment, and it went\\n \\n35  to the court of appeals. So it seems to me to be the  height of formalism to say that there has to be a second  notice. The clerk had already notified the court of  appeals that the judgment had been amended to include  restitution.</p><p> You\\'re recognizing that\\n\\n he could file -- you could treat as an amended notice of\\n\\n appeal, so it\\'s one notice of appeal but it\\'s been\\n\\n amended.</p><p> Well, but if they don\\'t  have knowledge, which is what we\\'re assuming here  because that was alleged -</p><p> Why couldn\\'t you treat a  notice of appeal as adequate to cover modifications of  the judgment from which the appeal is taken? Because  that\\'s what this is. It\\'s a modification of the  judgment.</p><p> Why -- why isn\\'t the  judge\\'s failure to give the necessary advice, why  doesn\\'t that come under Rule 52?</p><p> Well, that seems to -- to  have another -- yet another proceeding, a 2255, instead  of saying, well, the judge forgot to give them the - the advice, so that was a harmful error.</p><p> Then why -- why -- you - I think you answered this, but I didn\\'t grasp what the  answer was.  The -- the judge makes a mistake. Doesn\\'t  advise the defendant, if you want to appeal a  restitution order you have to file a notice of appeal.  Didn\\'t say that. Isn\\'t it harmful error, that slip that  the court made?</p><p> But it didn\\'t happen in  this case.</p><p> So the Court committed an\\n \\n error and it wasn\\'t harmless.</p><p> May I ask about the  criminal rule -- what number is it? -- 32, the provision  that says, \"Appealing a sentence. After sentence, the  Court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal  the sentence.\"</p><p> And Defendant was so  advised after the sentence was issued. There was no  such instruction, no such advice from the Court when the  restitution order was entered.</p><p> So what is your position  on whether the Court must advise the defendant of any  right to appeal the restitution order?</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>Did I understand you,  Mr. Rashkind, to say earlier that you think you would\\n \\n  have an argument even if (b)() didn't exist? In other  words, and another way to say this is suppose we think  that (b)() deals with a different situation from the  situation that you're talking about. Do you still have  an argument -</p><p> -- or is it dependent on  (b)()?</p><p> Mr. Rashkind --</p><p> Mr. Rashkind, as I hear you\\n\\n now, you're saying something different from what I\\n\\n understood your brief to be saying, so maybe I just -- I\\n\\n understood your brief to be principally arguing that\\n\\n this was a consequence of Rule (b)(), and so far, I\\n\\n haven't heard you mention Rule (b)(). Instead, what\\n\\n you seem to be saying is that regardless of Rule\\n\\n (b)(), we should treat the initial judgment and the\\n\\n later judgment as though they are the same judgment.\\n\\n And (b)() doesn't have to exist for that argument to\\n\\n be correct. I'm not saying that argument is correct,\\n\\n but it's a different argument than the argument I\\n\\n understood you to be making in your brief.\\n\\n So which are you making?</p><p> What's -- what's the  argument that's exclusive of (b)()?</p><p> Mr. --</p><p> Where were you going?</p><p> Well, maybe this would be a\\n\\n good segue. This -- this -- you understand the\\n\\n requirement of a notice of appeal to be jurisdictional.\\n\\n Do you understand the requirement of timeliness to be\\n\\n jurisdictional or not?</p><p> But not here? I mean, it's  a little bit odd. In the civil context, fees would be  waived for the second notice of appeal and -- and in the  criminal context not.</p><p> Okay. Now, I understand it\\n\\n doesn't matter in this case --</p><p> Is that correct?\\n\\n And are there requirements as to what counts\\n\\n as a notice of appeal? In other words, suppose I'm a\\n\\n defendant and I miss my  days, I don't file a notice\\n\\n of appeal within that time. Actually, I don't file it\\n\\n later; I file a brief.</p><p> Does the brief count as a\\n\\n notice of appeal?</p><p> In certain situations?</p><p> Okay. But assuming that\\n\\n that's not just applicable to pro se situations, I file\\n\\n a brief; I file it late; the government doesn't say\\n\\n anything about it. The appeal goes forward?</p><p> Okay.</p><p> -- because you objected.\\n\\n But in the criminal context, that's a non-jurisdictional\\n\\n rule. That's just a claims processing rule --</p><p> In the civil context, am I  right that sometimes you file a second notice of appeal  but you're -- the rules waive fees?</p><p> That might be true, but\\n\\n still, aren't we to wait until Congress fixes it?</p><p> Presumably, Congress sees\\n\\n \\n  problems; Congress fixes problems. And -- and you might  be right that this is the kind of problem that Congress  has fixed in the past, but that by itself doesn't seem  to give us the ability to go fix it ahead of the time  that they do.</p><p> I think in Mr. Rashkind's\\n\\n reply brief, he represents that there was no awareness\\n\\n of the opportunity to appeal. I mean, the only thing\\n\\n that gives you pause in a case like this is just because\\n\\n usually, you only have to file one notice of appeal.\\n\\n You do get worried about, you know, traps for the unwary\\n\\n and a person who just won't understand that there's\\n\\n another stage in this process and needs to file a notice\\n\\n of appeal.\\n\\n As long as the Court is fulfilling its\\n\\n obligation of saying, okay, now, you know, if you have\\n\\n an objection to this, you need to file another notice of\\n\\n appeal, well, that solves the problem. But if the Court\\n\\n doesn't say it, it doesn't solve the problem.\\n\\n And apparently, that's what happened in this\\n\\n case.

They've chosen it to be efficient. And virtually in  every other case, you've never raised an objection.  Why did you raise an objection here? What  was the purpose of doing this? Was it to make a test  case?</p><p> I'm talking about a\\n\\n Rule 32 error.</p><p> Why don't we just say\\n\\n this was a Rule 32 error?</p><p> So would we find this to\\n\\n be a Rule 32 error?</p><p> It's just -</p><p> So is the government\\n\\n right, however, that the Eleventh Circuit had issued a\\n\\n decision telling you to file a second notice of appeal?\\n\\n Telling the public, not you personally.</p><p> No, no.

Why  did it wait here?</p><p> Well, I just asked  whether they did it routinely, and you said not  post-Dolan.  So what do they do now?</p><p> But they still did.

What would -- what would they be  talking about?</p><p> Well, one of the  things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. I  don't understand how that helps on this question.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p><p> So -</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>Okay. So when you say what  it's applied to, you're not talking about it in terms of  the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking  about?</p><p> Yeah, but in a physical  sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that's  what the Chief Justice was talking about. It's applied  to the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it in  a different sense, and I don't really understand what - what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- where  is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside?  No. It's applied to the outside.</p><p> No. But what if you -- you  were saying it's an open -- it would be a difficult  question. You'd have to apply numerous factors to  determine what is the article of manufacture there.</p><p> Listing factors is not  helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is  knows what the determination must -- what determination  must be made. The factors are helpful in making the  determination.  Now what you just said about the article of  manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\n \\n51  applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said?</p><p> This hypothetical is not  helpful to me, because I can't get over the thought that  nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like  the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think,  $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What  if it cost $,000? What if it got  miles per gallon?  What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\n \\n32  So if that is a real question, if it is a  real question whether the article of manufacture there  is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about  the test for determining what is the article of  manufacture.</p><p> But this hypothetical is -</p><p> The Solicitor General has  proposed a test with four factors to determine the  article question. Do you agree with those? Are there  others you would add?</p><p> What is the difference?</p><p> Is there any difference in  practical terms between that and your causation argument\\n \\n or apportionment?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>And that's why I looked at  page , and it says that seems to do it.</p><p> And if you don't tell the  jury that there is that distinction, I think you either  disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you  create the kind of absurd results that your brief is  full of. So that's what I'm looking for.</p><p> And that's the problem in\\n\\n the case. So I thought -- and that's why I pointed to\\n\\n the brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\n\\n here, and we're talking here about a multicomponent\\n\\n product.\\n\\n \\n55</p><p> The problem, of course, is\\n\\n that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\n\\n they only want to apply it to the front.</p><p> You don't think it's  difficult, but they think -</p><p> -- they think it's  difficult. In fact, they think it's easy on their side.  So if I go through and come to the  conclusion, at least, that each side has a good  argument, under those circumstances, why don't we focus  on the question that is of great importance across\\n \\n35  industries and leave the application of that and whether  it was properly raised to the lower courts?</p><p> I get your point. I'll  read it and I'll -</p><p> But I have a question on  the general issue, which I think is tough. And the  general question that I have is I have been looking for  a standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\n \\n36  quite close; the parties actually in the government are  fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the  Internet Association, the software industry. And you  know that brief I'm talking about on Facebook and some  others.</p><p> Okay. What they did is  they went back into history. They have a lot of  different cases which they base the standard on, and  they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague,  but that the design where it's been applied to only  part -- it's on page  -- of a multicomponent product  and does not drive demand for the entire product, the  article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only  the component to which the design applies. And only  profit attributable to that component may be awarded.  Now, really, to understand it, you have to  have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to  understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use  examples. And so that kind of standard, with perhaps  examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper,  you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on the  hood? No, no, no. You don't get all the profit from  the car.</p><p> Okay. Now, why not?</p><p> Oh. Then go ahead and  answer her question. At some point you can come back to  it.</p><p> So disagreement on this  point. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question  trying to figure out what the standard is. Now, why  can't we just ask the lower courts to listen to your  arguments and theirs, and work it out?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>And what is that in\\n\\n this -- in this case?</p><p> Then how do -- how would  you determine the profit attributable to the relevant  article of manufacture?</p><p> Did Samsung, at the  trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article  less than the whole phone?</p><p> When the -- when the  component -- when the article of manufacture isn't sold  apart from the entire product, how should the -- the  judge charge the jury on determining the profit  attributable to the infringing article?</p><p> May he -- may he complete  his answer to my question?</p><p> Is that because the  district judge limited them?</p><p> Who has the burden of\\n\\n showing what is the relevant article?

But let's talk about  the hard cases.</p><p> So you think that that\\n\\n question is not relevant to the first question.

And -- and you say, no, there's a real\\n\\n question as to whether it is being -- the design is\\n\\n being applied to the car itself.\\n\\n So how would you go about thinking about\\n\\n that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\n\\n under what instructions?</p><p> Let's take a case -- and I\\n \\n think that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\n\\n reason -- where the thing that makes the product\\n\\n distinctive does not cost all that much. There's not\\n\\n been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\n\\n some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\n\\n I just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\n\\n that's the principal reason why the product has been\\n\\n successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\n\\n do all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\n\\n reason why the car has been successful has to do with\\n\\n this particular appearance, the design.\\n\\n As I understood the government, that does\\n\\n not come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\n\\n into the question of what is the article.

Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle  design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of  genius and it identified the car.

Both parties, not the  government, both parties kind of leave it up and say,  oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simply  wouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test.  My preference, if -- if I were just making  another sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies to  see how the -- the extent to which the design affected  the consumer, and then the jury would have something to  do that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlong  into the statute.  You can\\'t really have apportionment, so it  seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to  have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example  that\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is  a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and  just follow the words of the statute.

And I don\\'t see that as a matter  of law.\\n \\n  I believe that your basic argument, everyone  is in agreement, that the test is an article of  manufacture for purposes of sale.  But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how  do we announce the right test for that? Because the  phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer  as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That  might be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know.  Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how to  figure out the component part. I don\\'t know where in  the record you would have enough to survive your  argument.</p><p> Please don\\'t get off\\n\\n track.</p><p> So let\\'s assume, because  it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody  else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards,  are the article of manufacture.  Now, the government would say, go to the  second test, which takes in some of the things that you  were talking about, to figure out how much of the  profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to  the shape of the car.  Now, as Justice Alito said, some people  don\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\n \\n44  just a small car. They want the car that has a certain  trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons.  Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s  90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body  accounts for only  percent of the cost of the car, but  90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape  of the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis?  That\\'s what I understand the government\\'s  analysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be told  to do, to decide how much value the design is to the  product being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in a  nutshell.</p><p> All right. That\\'s the  test.</p><p> Please don\\'t go to  the -- to the record.</p><p> Mr. Waxman, can we go\\n\\n back to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\n\\n test has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\n\\n going towards. Okay.\\n\\n They suggest two things. Article of\\n\\n \\n43  manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have a  four-part test. Do you agree that that four-part test  with respect to identifying just the article of  manufacture?</p><p> Do you endorse that part\\n\\n of the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\n\\n saying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\n\\n is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\n\\n that right?</p><p> Exactly.</p><p> That\\'s the article of\\n\\n manufacture.\\n\\n So now take the second part of the test and\\n\\n apply it to the Bug.</p><p> And so what, besides the\\n\\n jury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\n\\n instruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\n\\n error?</p><p> I said besides a\\n\\n properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\n\\n of Apple on the evidence presented?</p><p> And you\\'re answering\\n\\n \"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\n\\n instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\n\\n could not have found for Apple. Is that what --</p><p> I accept that,\\n\\n Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --</p><p> Now, I look at this\\n\\n record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\n\\n phone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\n\\n were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\n\\n this was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\n\\n Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\n\\n that, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\n\\n same. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\n\\n This is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\n\\n expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\n\\n them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\n\\n properly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\n\\n finding?</p><p> So besides the jury\\n\\n \\n instruction, what was the legal error?</p><p> Well, you can\\'t claim\\n\\n the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\n\\n innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\n\\n its -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n\\n \\n  perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks  only.</p><p> I don\\'t disagree with  you, but -</p><p> But that\\'s the first\\n\\n part of the test.</p><p> What\\'s the first step,  and how do you figure it out?</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>We'll hear argument  this morning in Case No. -797, Moore v.

There are two -- let me  rephrase it this way: There are different things in the  Briseno or Briseno opinion.  One is the -- the medical standards that are  taken from the medical publications that were current as  of the time of that decision. And then there are these  additional considerations, and that\\'s what\\'s regarded as  the Briseno factors.  But if you -- let\\'s take a -- disregard the  latter.

Because I think that may be a stronger leg.</p><p> But what was the -- what is  the problem with their analysis of that point?</p><p> Okay. On that one, is there  a consensus in the medical community that that\\'s  improper?</p><p> Well, here is an article  written by a number of experts, recent article from the  Journal of American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,  Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases\\n \\n  after Hall and DSM-. One of these experts was cited in  the -- in -- in one of the supporting amicus briefs by  professional organizations in Hall, which says that any  assessment of adaptive functioning must give sufficient  consideration to assets and deficits alike.

And I -- if you can give\\n\\n me a yes-or-no answer to this question, I\\'d appreciate\\n\\n it.\\n\\n Under Hall and Atkins, must a State use\\n\\n current medical standards, for example, DSM-, as\\n\\n opposed to older standards, for example, DSM-IV? Yes or\\n\\n no.</p><p> Then I don\\'t know --</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>I have one question, which  I don't think you can answer orally. But I think that  these cases -- you can point me to the answer. That's  what I want.  Look. There will be a bunch of easy cases.  And then there are going to be cases like your client  who has been on death row for 36 years. And there will  be borderline cases. And the reason they're borderline  is because the testing is right at the border, like an  IQ test. And then you'll put weight on what's called  related limitations in adaptive functioning, a matter  that on its face sounds as if it's maybe easy in some  cases and tough in another. All right?  What is the Court supposed to do? Are we  supposed to have all those hearings here? I mean,\\n \\n  you've made very good arguments for your client. There  are probably several others in the country in different  states which may have different standards. And if you  have some view that the law in this area should be law,  i.e., that it should be uniform across the country,  point me to something that will tell me how a district  judge should go about making this determination in  borderline cases.</p><p> My suspicion is that there  is no such thing, but that's why I asked the question.  I want to be sure. There might be.</p><p> I understand. But you are  saying whatever they should do, it shouldn't be what  went on here. Okay. I got that point.  I'm asking a different point. And if you  want my true motive, I don't think there is a way to  apply this kind of standard uniformly across the  country, and therefore, there will be disparities, and\\n \\n  uncertainties, and different people treated alike, and  -- and people who are alike treated differently. Okay?  Now, that's my whole story. And I want you  to say, no, you're wrong, there is a way to do it.  What?</p><p> Well, maybe I could ask a\\n\\n follow-up.</p><p> Basically, there are two\\n\\n things wrong, possibly, with the factors which we've\\n\\n heard. One I can't deal with at this moment in oral\\n\\n argument. You could go through them -- they're in the\\n\\n briefs -- one by one, and say reading them, actually,\\n\\n they're not consistent with or they reflect an error\\n\\n when compared with what the psychiatrists and\\n\\n psychologists think. Your answer is they don't. The\\n\\n other side says they do. Okay. I can't go further with\\n\\n that here.\\n\\n The other is the question of, why did the\\n\\n Texas court write these standards? I have to admit that\\n\\n in reading through Briseno, I came to at least pause\\n\\n when I read the words that they are trying to figure out\\n\\n what to do in borderline cases, and what they have done\\n\\n is not -- you know, I understand it, but they say we\\n\\n have to figure out the level at which a consensus of\\n\\n Texas citizens would agree that a person should be\\n\\n exempted from the death penalty.\\n\\n When I read that, and when I read, there are\\n\\n some other words -- that's on page  of the -- of the\\n\\n report, of the reported opinion -- when I read some\\n\\n other things that they said, I thought they were trying\\n\\n to do this, which we do often in law. But what's the\\n\\n \\n40  purpose of this? The whole purpose is to try to figure  out who not to execute because of their functioning, the  way they function. That's the purpose.  Let's look at what Texas citizens would  think about this person, and let's try to get standards  that reflect that. I really did think that's what they  were trying to do in that opinion. And they are arguing  that that's the wrong thing to try to do in this  instance.  First, because it would produce  nonuniformity among 50 states or among the many states  that have the death penalty.  Second, because the question is not what the  citizens of the state think about who should be  executed. That has nothing to do with it. Oddly  enough, in this case, what has to do with it is a  technical matter about this individual, that would free  some while subjecting others to the death penalty,  irrespective of what Texas citizens think.  So do you see my question? What were they  up to in this opinion? Briseno. I think they were up  to going back to the citizens of Texas. You saw what I  think they are up to. And you tell me if I'm right,  wrong or why.</p><p> Well, that's the point.  That's exactly the point. That's the point that we've  been making, or at least I thought we were. That the  whole point of Briseno is really to answer the question  that you said -- probably should say, no, it isn't  really there -- it's to help determine which persons  suffering borderline cases of mental disability ought to  be executed, or should not be because they are less  morally culpable.  Now, I did think that's what they said.  That does supply a reason for making differences, as  Justice Ginsburg just pointed out. And then the  question is, is it what the purpose of Atkins and the  other case Hall was, was it to give each State the right  to decide in borderline cases whom or whom not to  execute in light of their feelings about capital  punishment?  I thought it had a different purpose - unusual in the law -- but which was to appeal to  technical definitions of who and who is not mentally  retarded or intellectually disabled. That's a real  issue. But I think that this case does present that\\n \\n\\n49</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Can you explain why Texas  applies a different test to determine whether a school  child is intellectually disabled, or a juvenile  offender, to determine what to do with that offender,  Texas applies a different test when compatible with  current medical standards in both of those categories?  Why does it have a different standard for capital cases  only?</p><p> There is no doubt about  what the Texas court said. It's marching orders for  Texas courts. It said the habeas judge erred by  employing current clinical definition of intellectually  disabled, there in that respect, rather than the test we  established in Briseno. The test we established in  Briseno is -- is stated sharply and clearly as the test  that must be applied by Texas courts.  Is that how you read it?</p><p> It's on page 6a in these?</p><p> You describe these as  coming from some source, but Briseno itself listed  this -- these -- seven, was it? -- bullet points, did  not give a single citation of where any one came from.</p><p> Isn't making it  discretionary a huge problem in this area, because if  you let one trial court judge apply it and another one  does -- doesn't have to apply them, then you're opening  the door to inconsistent results depending upon who is  sitting on the trial court bench, something that we try  to prevent from happening in capital cases.</p><p> It was a strategic  advantage to doing that back in those days; right?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>And can I ask whether you  might be talking about two different things? And I  might be wrong about this, but as I understand adaptive  functioning, there are these particular areas of  functioning that have been set out. And what the  consensus is, is to say, well, if you have deficits in  four of these areas, it doesn't matter that you don't  have a deficit in another area. And that's what the  consensus is.  Now, within each area, people/psychologists  can look at, you know, within an area -</p><p> General, would you agree  with this: That the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in  Briseno and other places, has made clear its view that  -- that Texas can choose to execute people whom a -- a  complete consensus, a 100 percent consensus of  clinicians, would find to be intellectually disabled?  Would you agree with that?</p><p> -- to determine whether you  have a deficit. Yeah, you have to look at what you can  do and what you can't do to decide whether there is a  deficit in that area. So the two things might not be in  conflict at all.</p><p> Well, Mr. Sloan, can I -</p><p> We wouldn't need that, would\\n\\n we, Mr. Sloan? We could say that the Briseno standards\\n\\n are in conflict with the old Atkins standards, as well\\n\\n as the new ones. There wouldn't need to be a difference\\n\\n between the old ones and the new ones for you to win\\n\\n this case.</p><p> I'm -- I'm asking about  Briseno and other court of appeals' decisions.  And I thought that you said this in your\\n \\n  brief, that the -- that your view of the point of State  discretion is that a person who everybody -- every  clinician would find to be intellectually disabled, the  State does not have to find to be intellectually  disabled because a consensus of Texas citizens would not  find that person to be intellectually disabled.  Isn't that the premise of the court of  appeals' decisions?</p><p> Mr. Sloan, I think it's more  than that. Because it's not just you can't consult the  current guidance and you have to go back to the '92  standard. It says, you have to go back to Briseno, and  Briseno has these seven factors that are not consistent  with the old standards, just as they are not consistent  with the new standards.</p><p> Could I just make -- I'm\\n\\n sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sloan, but could I just make\\n\\n sure I understand that? Because what you're essentially\\n\\n saying is that the court of appeals said, you are barred\\n\\n from using new standards; you must use the Briseno\\n\\n standards. So the two are flip sides of the same coin,\\n\\n and what the holding was, is you must use Briseno\\n\\n standards.\\n\\n Now, your QP reflected their framing of the\\n\\n issue -- you can't use new standards; you must use the\\n\\n Briseno standards -- but you were just reflecting their\\n\\n essential holding, which is, we have this Briseno case\\n\\n and you have to use it.</p><p> Well, I guess I just don't  understand this. And I really don't understand it in  light of your brief, which I'm going to start to quote  from pretty soon. But what the -- it seems to me what  the Texas court did is to say, look, we're going to  accept the three dimensions, the adaptive deficits and  the IQ and the age. But with respect to the quality and\\n \\n30  the degree of impairment -- I think that that's their  language -- we're not going to accept the clinicians'  view so that people with mild impairment can be  executed, even though the clinicians would find those  people to be intellectually disabled.</p><p> I know that they applied the  three-prong test. The question is the degree of  impairment as to each of these -- those prongs.  And again, it seems to me pretty clear from  your brief when you're talking about Atkins didn't  establish a national standard, that you're saying too  that the Texas -- and if you're not, I mean, I -- I  guess I'm surprised by that -- that you're saying that  the Texas courts do need to follow clinical assessments  of intellectual impairment? Because that's -- it's just  not what you say on page  and  and  of your brief.</p><p> I'm sorry, Mr. General  Keller, because you keep on saying the three-prong  definition, but the three-prong definition just tells  you, you have to look to IQ, you have to look to  adaptive functioning, you have to look to youth. It  doesn't tell you anything about what qualities you look  to and the extent of impairment within those factors,\\n \\n34  and that's where the Texas court has insisted upon its  freedom to go out on its own.</p><p> Because Briseno says  essentially that this can trump everything, and it says  that this can trump everything because of the underlying  view of Briseno and other Texas Court of Appeals cases  that we don't have to look at the clinical standards and  that we can execute people whom clinicians would find to  be disabled.</p><p> Let me just take one of the\\n\\n Briseno factors, right? And it's the idea that what lay\\n\\n people think about the person growing up is relevant to\\n\\n an assessment of adaptive function.\\n\\n Now, no clinician would ever say that. The\\n\\n clinicians say, no, that's sort of like stereotypical\\n\\n layperson view of adaptive functioning, which is\\n\\n different from the -- the clinical view of adaptive\\n\\n functioning. But the Briseno factors made very clear,\\n\\n sort of point one, that you're supposed to sort of --\\n\\n that you're supposed to rely on -- on what the neighbor\\n\\n said and what the teacher with absolutely no experience\\n\\n with respect to intellectual disabilities said.\\n\\n So that seems to me a very big difference\\n\\n between the Briseno factors and the clinical view of\\n\\n intellectual disability.</p><p> I have a follow-up unless  you want to go, Justice Sotomayor.</p><p> Well, he was talking about  my question.  So go on.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Right. I -- yes, it has  adopted the three-part test. But within each of those  prongs, you get to apply it.  I thought that that was the entire point of  Hall: No, that's wrong. You don't get to apply it  however you want.</p><p> General, can I ask -- I'm\\n\\n sort of trying to reconcile the various statements you\\n\\n made here, and in your briefs, and here's what I come up\\n\\n with, and tell me if it's right.\\n\\n I think what you're saying is the Texas\\n\\n Court of Appeals is complying with Atkins because it\\n\\n used a three-pronged test, focusing on IQ and adaptive\\n\\n function and age. But within each of those prongs, in\\n\\n order to make this distinction between clinical\\n\\n disability and moral culpability within each of those\\n\\n prongs, the Court can choose how to apply that prong,\\n\\n and particularly what levels of impairment to use.\\n\\n Is that a fair assessment?</p><p> But the -- but the genesis\\n\\n of these factors was that the court said the clinical\\n\\n standards are just too subjective and they don't reflect\\n\\n what Texas citizens think, both of those things. They\\n\\n are too subjective, and they just reflect what\\n\\n clinicians think; they don't reflect what Texas citizens\\n\\n think. That was the genesis of the standards, which\\n\\n suggests that Justice Kennedy is right about how they\\n\\n operate and also how they were intended to operate.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Is it your view that  Briseno factors are all consistent with DSM-IV?</p><p> Well, of course, General,\\n\\n there are going to be cases in which the Briseno factors\\n\\n will show disabled, but that's not the question.\\n\\n The question is can they be an exhaustive\\n\\n list.</p><p> But the theme is -- of - of the -- the Petitioner's brief, that the Briseno  factors are intended to really limit the classification  of those persons with intellectual disability as defined  by an almost uniform medical consensus.</p><p> I have the same question  as -- as the Chief Justice. It -- it just seems to me  the question presented doesn't cut to the heart of the  case as you describe it.  My understanding of your argument -- and  again, I don't think it's wholly reflected in that  question -- is that whether you use the most current or  even slightly -- slightly older medical standards, there  is still a conflict.  Am I right about that, that that's your</p><p> I tried to ask myself if  the Court could say, use the Briseno factors first, and  after that, if you find no intellectual disability, then  turn to the clinical standards. But as Justice Kagan  points out, I think there is a conflict.</p><p> But it is true that Atkins  left some discretion to the States. What is the rule  that you propose for how closely standards must hew to  medical practice?</p><p> I -- I -- excuse me, Chief  Justice.</p><p> Are you saying that the  Briseno factors capture all individuals with  intellectual disability?</p><p> But isn't that the effect?</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>Mr. Sloan, cut to the  chase of the underlying question. Was the criminal  court of appeals using any clinical standard, any  medical clinical standard?</p><p> It was making up -</p><p> -- on the latter?</p><p> All right. So is it  fair to say that in Texas, a mildly disabled person is  unlikely to be considered disabled by the CCA under the  Briseno factors?\\n \\n42</p><p> But you -- according to  one of the cases that you've cited to me where someone  was clinically diagnosed as mildly disabled, and the CCA  said under the Briseno factors that they should not be  executed. A lot of the cases that you provided me with,  there was clinical evidence of moderate -- and mostly  severe -- but moderate to severe disability. But  there -- was there anyone with mild disability that the  Briseno factors would find sufficiently disabled?</p><p> Did they find him mildly  disabled?</p><p> So why did it go through\\n\\n so much trouble in saying that it wasn't going to use\\n\\n current standards, that it was only going to use the\\n\\n older standards and the Briseno factors?</p><p> Mr. General, going - just -- is it your view that what Texas is trying to do  is determine who is truly on the clinical borderline as  opposed to trying to determine the type of mentally  disabled people that it thinks should be executed -</p><p> Well, if we believe that\\n\\n its definition of relatedness has no support anywhere,\\n\\n would that have been a valid reason for discounting the\\n\\n current clinical standards?</p><p> Well, I'm not sure how I  can accept your characterization of the CCA decision  when basically it's saying his poor intellectual  functioning on IQ tests, which happened when he was  younger, were not related to his intellectual abilities;  they were related to his poverty, his -- his morbidity  factors.  If they are saying that, how are you saying  they weren't finding that he wasn't intellectually  disabled because of those other factors?</p><p> That's how I read their  decision.</p><p> Well, wait a minute.  The testimony of Compton was, having looked at all of\\n \\n45  the IQ tests, was: I'm not sure. It's probable that  he's intellectually disabled by IQ, but he wouldn't  qualify in my judgment because of his adaptive skills.  But even the State's own expert said that it was  probable that he was intellectually disabled.</p><p> Well, that happened in  Atkins, too. Regrettably, until we decided that mental  disability was a ground to excuse execution, many  mentally disabled defendants were represented by counsel  who thought that arguing differently was a better  strategy.</p><p> How about if that same  person has a job in NASA calculating the air space  shuttle launches? Is that person not intellectually  disabled simply because they can use that particular  skill in a way that gains them employment?\\n \\n35</p><p> Mr. Sloan, can we go -</p><p> Can we go to the  practical application of what you're saying for a\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Let's take the decision of the CCA here.\\n\\n All right? They found two prongs that Mr. Moore had not\\n\\n met: That he couldn't prove that he was clinically\\n\\n intellectually disabled, that his IQ was higher than\\n\\n what was generally recognized clinically. What did they\\n\\n do wrong with respect to that prong?\\n\\n And then secondly, with respect to the\\n\\n adaptive-function prong, what did the court below do\\n\\n wrong?\\n\\n Identify the two ways in which what they're\\n\\n doing and how they're applying the standards we're\\n\\n talking about were in error.</p><p> There is no medical rule  to that.</p><p> Well, I thought the most  significant part of this alleged error by you in your  briefs were that it assumed that things like poverty,  poor nutrition, poor performance in school were not  attributable to intellectual functioning, but to his  lack of a good home, essentially. Why is that  clinically wrong?</p><p> I'm sorry. Go back to  Justice Kagan's question.</p><p> Go ahead, and then I'll\\n \\n\\n32</p><p> May I note that, as a  footnote only, you can continue, that in Ex parte Sosa,  the CCA sent back a case directing the lower court to  apply the Briseno factors, even though that court had  analyzed the case under the clinical standards. It  appears to be acting as if those Briseno factors are the  clinical factors and are controlling, even though there  are stereotypes built into them.</p><p> Well, the DMA and all  the other clinicians recognized that some mentally  disabled people can have some adaptive functioning.  Idiot savants, for example. Is it your position that if  someone can calculate math in their head they can't be  intellectually disabled?</p><p> No medical support.</p><p> Well, the problem is\\n\\n that, as I read the CCA opinion, it's looking at\\n\\n adaptive strengths only and not at adaptive deficits and\\n\\n looking at the depth of them or how they form the\\n\\n intellectual disability component. Even Dr. Compton,\\n\\n \\n50  the State's expert, testified that Mr. Moore could not,  from memory, recreate a clock.  Now, she says, I don't quite believe that,  but she doesn't quite believe that of a person who, at  's, father threw him out because he was dumb and  illiterate: Couldn't tell the days of the week;  couldn't tell the months of the year; couldn't tell  time; couldn't do anything that one would consider  within an average, or even a low average, of  intellectual functioning, who is eating out of garbage  cans repeatedly and getting sick after each time he did  it, but not learning from his mistakes.  The -- the State's opinion does very little  except say those are products of his poor environment;  they're not products of his intellectual disability.</p><p> The problem with Lennie,  who the Briseno factors were -- were fashioned after - Lennie was working on a farm. How is that different  from mowing a lawn?  And -- and the State had no problem in  saying that Lennie, even though he could work, earn a  living, plan his trying to hide the death of the rabbit  he killed, that he could do all of those things, and yet  he was not just mildly, but severely disabled.  Why is the fact that he could mow lawns and  play pool indicative of a strength that overcomes all  the other deficits?</p><p> But it informed its view  of how to judge the lack or strength of adaptive  functions. It used the Lennie standard.</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>We'll hear argument  next today in Case -8049, Buck v. Davis.  Ms. Swarns.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA A. SWARNS  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> There's a tension in\\n \\n your -- your briefing over what you're really arguing\\n\\n\\n\\n for. In the question presented, you focus on the Fifth\\n\\n Circuit standard for a COA in saying they're imposing an\\n\\n improper and unduly burdensome. But most of the\\n\\n briefing, and as you sort of begun today, is really\\n\\n focused on the underlying merits of the case. And you\\n\\n sort of have to make a choice, don't you, because if we\\n\\n didn't focus on the merits and rule in your favor, we\\n\\n don't get to say too much about the threshold for\\n\\n Certificate of Appealability. Well, if we focus on the\\n\\n Certificate of Appealability, all we're saying on the\\n\\n merits is there's a substantial showing. So what do you\\n\\n want us to do, on the merits or on the Certificate of\\n\\n Appealability?</p><p> Right. Right. So\\n\\n is that what you want us to say, that because the merits\\n\\n are debatable, he should have gotten a Certificate of\\n\\n Appealability? Or do you want us to say, well, he\\n\\n \\n  should have won, and so he obviously should have gotten  a Certificate of Appealability?</p><p> Okay. So on the  merits -- on the merits then, you just want us to say,  oh, reasonable jurists could disagree about whether or  not he was unconstitutionally sentenced?</p><p> So the -- the -- the  answer to Justice Alito is that in our opinion, we  should say our interpretation of Rule 60B, in case it  doesn't apply unless it's a capital case? Rule 60B  doesn't draw that distinction.</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  The case is submitted.  (Whereupon, at :02 p.m., the case in the  above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  Ms. Swarns, you have four minutes remaining.  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA A. SWARNS  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Clearly the\\n\\n underlying claim on the merits would be stronger, and --\\n\\n and it would be a lot more extraordinary under 60(b).</p><p> What is the\\n\\n relationship between the ruling on prejudice with\\n\\n respect to ineffective assistance and the 60(b)\\n\\n analysis? I mean, do you agree that if we disagree with\\n\\n your submission on prejudice under Strickland, that your\\n\\n 60(b) analysis kind of falls apart?</p><p> So is your  suggestion that they deny more because they've taken up  more search and look at the merits than the other  circuits?</p><p> You know, I guess my  question kind of cuts the other way. I'm saying they  don't -- yes, and you make the point, there was a  substantial amount of process. There was a long  consideration. There was a lot of briefing. I would  have thought the purpose of a Certificate of  Appealability would be to make the decision to move  forward without all that elaborate process?</p><p> Well, that gets  tougher and tougher. I mean, you're talking about  reasonable jurists debate. Okay. That's -- that's a  very low threshold. But when you say reasonable jurists  debate, whether there's been an abuse of discretion, I  mean, abuse of discretion gives a broad range to the  district court. And now you're asking, well, is there a  reasonable person out there who could debate that you  ought to have deferred to that exercise of discretion?  It seems to me, yes, it's a different standard, but it's  quite a different standard.  And the broader question here is whether the  Fifth Circuit applies the wrong standard on a  Certificate of Appealability, and it seems to me that if  you're going to say, particularly when you are reviewing  an abuse of discretion standard, that you're going to be  able to look at and say, no, no, there's nothing  substantial here.\\n \\n37</p><p> I understand your  arguments on the merits, but do they apply equally to  the Certificate of Appealability? I mean, you argue  that you should prevail on the merits. But the question  on a Certificate of Appealability is whether there's  been a substantial showing of denial of a constitutional  right.  Assuming you haven't already seen the  analysis on the merits and you're looking at this  question for the first time before going through this  analysis, wouldn't it seem pretty straightforward to  say, okay, maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong, but at  least he's made a substantial showing. Let's give him a\\n \\n36  Certificate of Appealability, and then we'll go through  the normal procedures on the merits?</p><p> The risk of  injustice, if it was a sentence for ten years, that's  unjust.</p><p> Okay. So that  doesn't work.</p><p> What else?</p><p> I guess the same  answer there. Sentenced to 40 years, that impairs the  integrity of the system. I mean, I know that obviously,  death is different.</p><p> But it's hard to  factor in why it's different in the context of  interpreting particular rules.</p><p> To the -- to the\\n\\n extent it is a unique case, it really doesn't provide a\\n\\n basis for us to say anything at all about how the Fifth\\n\\n Circuit approaches Certificates of Appealability, does\\n\\n it? It's a unique case, so this would be an odd\\n\\n platform to issue general rules.\\n\\n But in the brief you say, well, the Fifth\\n\\n Circuit grants these in a very small percentage of\\n\\n cases. The other circuits are much higher.\\n\\n But if it is so unique, I don't know how we\\n\\n can use it to articulate general rules.</p><p> Was it wrong? Was  it wrong for the court of appeals to conduct the merits  inquiry in this case? I mean, they went to considerable  length in trying to determine whether or not the claims  were valid.  Was that an error? Should they have just  said, well, you know, the -- the test is what,  substantial -- showing a substantial -- a substantial  showing of denial? They should have just done, you  know, kind of a sort of quick-and-dirty peek at the  merits and say, yeah, there might be something there.</p><p> So should our  decision be just that, they erred in looking at the  merits? They should have just issued a Certificate of  Appealability and sent it back? That's not what you  want, is it?</p><p> Well, but it seems  to me we're well beyond a COA should issue. You don't  want us to say that. You want us to say that there's  been a constitutional violation in this case and the  court of appeals was wrong in determining that there  wasn't.</p><p> So what is the test  you -- should we say the Fifth Circuit should apply in  considering whether to issue Certificates of  Appealability? Do you have anything to add to the  statutory language?</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Keller.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</p><p> I assume the  facts -- I assume the facts in the other Saldano cases  are similarly heinous, the ones where the state  determined that nonetheless that there was a risk that  they would be sentenced to death because of their race.  And I don't understand -- I understand the procedural  differences in this case, but I don't understand why  that ultimate conclusion doesn't apply here as well. In  other words, regardless of whether the evidence was  admitted by the prosecution or by the defense, it would  seem to me that the same concern would be present.</p><p> I'm not sure how the\\n\\n quickness of the determination helps you at all, when\\n\\n one response would be, well, they had this evidence that\\n\\n he was, by virtue of his race, likely to be dangerous,\\n\\n so they didn't spend that much time on it.</p><p> So did they err in  looking at it more closely?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>This is a very -- a very  unusual case, and what occurred at the penalty phase of  this trial is indefensible. But what concerns me is  what the implications of your argument would be for all  of the other prisoners who -- let's say they're not even  capital cases, but they have -- they want now to raise  some kind of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  That is procedurally defaulted. And they say we should  have relief from a prior judgment denying habeas relief.  And that -- what would prevent a ruling in  your favor in this case from opening the door to the  litigation of all of those issues so that those - Martinez and Trevino would effectively be retroactive.</p><p> Would it be possible to  defend what the Fifth Circuit did based on the prejudice  prong of Strickland? There -- there was a lot of  evidence both relating to the offense that was committed  and to other conduct by Petitioner that would show  future dangerousness. It would -- it didn't have to  rest exclusively on this bizarre expert testimony; isn't  that correct?</p><p> I didn't think that your  primary argument had to do with the -- the relative  prejudice of having it done by the prosecutor and the  defense attorney. I thought your argument was that the  State of Texas feels a certain -- feels a special  responsibility when one of its employees engages in this  misconduct. And when the -- when the evidence is  introduced by the defendant's attorney, it's an  ineffective assistance-of-counsel question, and it has  to be adjudicated under the Strickland test.</p><p> I'm sorry.

And he says, yes.  So that seems -- I mean, you can't prove it,  that that was the key factor, but it seems like it could  have been a substantial factor. And Texas, in six  cases, says this is totally wrong. And now in this  seventh case, you're taking the opposite position. And  I have to admit, like what the Chief Justice seemed, I  don't understand the reason. It seems to me it proves  the arbitrariness of what's going on.  But regardless, the issue here is, is there  some good reason why this person shouldn't have been  able to reopen his case? I mean, that's the question.  What's the reason?  I mean, after all, we later decided these  other cases, Martinez. His circumstances seem to fit  Martinez pretty much like a glove. The State certainly  doesn't have a strong interest any more than in the  other cases, or at least not obvious to me, some kind of  reliance. So he has a case where Martinez seems to  apply. He couldn't -- he was diligent -- diligent, not  much -- not too much reliance on the other side, and  seems to meet Martinez's criteria for hearing the issue.\\n \\n32  Why doesn't that make it extraordinary  enough to reopen under Rule 60(b)? That seems to me the  question in the case.</p><p> And all this took place  after this Court decided Martinez and Trevino?</p><p> Yeah, I mean, you listed a  whole bunch of things in which he could have done.

Now, people  don't expect the State to do something as improper as  this, but the people who understand that not everything  that the prosecution says about a defendant, you know,  that people -- the jurors should -- should think about  those claims seriously because the prosecution has  interests of its own. But the defense counsel's  interests are supposed to be with the defendant.  I'm just repeating myself. If the defense  counsel does it, I mean, you know, who is the jury to  complain?</p><p> He did exactly what you\\n\\n would have expected him to do. Given that Coleman was\\n\\n still on the books, you would have said it would be --\\n\\n had been improper for him to ask for the relief that you\\n\\n are now suggesting that he should have asked for. At\\n\\n least it would have been futile with Coleman still on\\n\\n the books.</p><p> Isn't this substantially\\n\\n different than Gonzalez? Wasn't it important in\\n\\n Gonzalez that the nature -- what the nature of the error\\n\\n was? In Gonzalez what the court said, the error is\\n\\n commonplace to -- lawyers misjudge time limits all the\\n\\n time. The one thing we know about this error is that\\n\\n it's not commonplace. Even the two people who called\\n\\n the Quijano as defense witnesses never themselves raised\\n\\n race as a cause -- as a reason for future dangerousness.\\n\\n Only this attorney who's been disciplined repeatedly for\\n\\n his malfeasance in representing clients, who one\\n\\n newspaper said if you want to ensure a death penalty,\\n\\n hire this lawyer. In that situation, isn't this that\\n\\n \\n rare case that Gonzalez talked about?\\n\\n34</p><p> But this is the whole point,  really. They are not supposed to be doing what you do  when you decide an appeal. And they -- and they  actually don't have jurisdiction to decide the appeal.  I mean, they are supposed to be performing a gatekeeping  function, not deciding the merits of the case.</p><p> But if you said that that's  because those -- that's -- it's more prejudicial when  the prosecution introduces this? Is that what you said  -</p><p> -- to Justice Ginsburg?  That -- that's your basic theory?\\n \\n42</p><p> Yeah. But -- and -- and  that makes it more prejudicial. That's your basic  theory?</p><p> Because I don't -- I guess  if there's both points, tell me what the other point is  because I guess I just don't understand that point. But  it seems more prejudicial when the defense attorney uses  it.  I mean, prosecution, you have a jury sitting  there, and it realizes that the prosecutor has an  interest in convicting a person and in getting a -- a  sentence that the prosecution wants, so everything is  discounted a little bit. But when your own -- when the  defendant's own lawyer introduces this, the jury is  going to say, well, it must be true. Even the  defendant's lawyer thinks that this is true. So, you  know, who a.m. I to -- to argue with that? It seems  wildly more prejudicial to me when the defense attorney  introduces it.</p><p> Yes. And the legal question\\n \\n44  here, right, is whether this ineffective assistance of  counsel claim, which has never been heard by any court,  is a strong one. And a strong one including that the  ineffective assistance here is likely to be prejudicial,  which it seems as though it's -- it's far more likely to  be prejudicial when the defense counsel does it.</p><p> Mr. Keller, you know, some  of the statistics that Petitioner have pointed us to - in capital cases, a COA is denied in 60 percent of Fifth  Circuit cases as compared to  percent of Eleventh  Circuit cases, two roughly similar circuits where COA's  are denied in capital cases ten times more in the Fifth  Circuit. I mean, it does suggest one of these two  circuits is doing something wrong.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>The State did change its  mind with respect to Mr. Buck's case, and I assume  they'll tell us that there's a reason for that. It's  not just because his defense counsel introduced it,  because that -- that was true in some other cases as  well.  But if -- if we rely on that too much, won't  this discourage prosecutors from offering discretionary  concessions?</p><p> But the prosecutor  revisited it, Mr. Keller, in cross-examination.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': '<p>All right. Now let\\'s\\n\\n start with the COA issue. With respect to the COA\\n\\n issue, I read your adversaries who are -- to say\\n\\n Martinez, Trevino could never constitute an exceptional\\n\\n circumstance to -- to justify the issuance of a COA.\\n\\n Basically that\\'s their position, \\'cause they weren\\'t\\n\\n \\n made retroactive.</p><p> How old was Mr. Buck?\\n\\n How old was Mr. Buck at the time?</p><p> Does that -- not to have  the testimony reread, but for the report.  So tell me what -- how that changes the  calculus, those two things in any way.</p><p> But, number two, they  asked for the psychiatric report.</p><p> I don\\'t know if all of  them, but someone wanted to talk about it, that\\'s what  they told the judge. Can we talk about life without - life without parole? I don\\'t even know what the answer  to that was. I should have checked that -</p><p> So they were obviously  considering mercy. Somebody was.</p><p> -- but if you do you,  can tell me?</p><p> And they asked for two  things: Could they consider life without parole?</p><p> I don\\'t say it\\'s not,\\n\\n but why is that heinousness so much greater that no jury\\n\\n could have exercised mercy? No juror.</p><p> So if one -- is it a  reasonable possibility that one juror, even the one who\\n \\n sent the note that says is it possible to do parole,\\n\\n\\n\\n life without parole, could have been convinced to\\n\\n exercise mercy if race wasn\\'t used, can you answer that\\n\\n question \"absolutely not\"? When, in at least one of the\\n\\n Saldano cases, a man poured gasoline on a woman and\\n\\n watched her die, we had a nation that was mortified,\\n\\n shocked, and completely traumatized by watching a pilot\\n\\n burn to death. So why is that crime any less heinous\\n\\n than this one?</p><p> Well, the level of  prejudice is the reasonable possibility that if one  juror, because Texas uses one juror does not agree with  death, death is not imposed, correct?</p><p> Why does it matter who  uses race? I mean, in Batson challenges we don\\'t care  if the person exercising a racial challenge is the  prosecutor or the defense attorney. We say neither  should use race in a negative way against a defendant.  So why is it different here? Why is it okay or not okay  for the prosecutor to introduce the greater likelihood  of a person being dangerous on the basis of race alone?  Not okay for the prosecutor, but it\\'s less bad for the  defense attorney to do it?</p><p> \"Reasonable probability\"\\n\\n is the actual language, not \"substantial.\"</p><p> Counselor, I know that  there\\'s been a lot of talk about how small the reference  to race was with respect to the questioning at trial on  both sides, but how much was it a part of the actual  report, because that\\'s what the jury asked for?</p><p> -- argue that the Court\\n\\n had improperly denied a COA, and that was their basic\\n\\n position. They didn\\'t really engage the merits; they\\n\\n just engaged the standard of issuance of a COA. We go\\n\\n back to that. Are you satisfied if we say they used the\\n\\n wrong standard for denying the COA, or will you only be\\n\\n satisfied if we say you win?</p><p> The centers in this  case --</p><p> So first, what does the\\n\\n retroactivity argument have to do with anything? All\\n\\n right? What does it apply to? And aren\\'t you making\\n\\n Martinez and -- and Trevino retroactive if we recognize\\n\\n it as an exceptional reason to forgive a procedural\\n\\n default.\\n\\n And then second, there\\'s a circuit split on\\n\\n this question, and you recognize it in your brief. You\\n\\n have the Third Circuit using a three-part test that says\\n\\n Martinez and Trevino, under certain circumstances, can\\n\\n be a reason to find exceptional circumstance.\\n\\n The Ninth Circuit has a six- or seven- or\\n\\n eight-part test. They never make it simple. And the\\n\\n Fifth says never.\\n\\n Where do you stand on all these tests? And\\n\\n what\\'s your position with respect to this -- to this\\n\\n retroactivity question?</p><p> That\\'s the Third Circuit  test, isn\\'t it?</p><p> It doesn\\'t say anything\\n \\n40  to the Fifth Circuit that three State court judges, two  of their colleagues on the Fifth Circuit, two justices  of this Court, have said or found Mr. Buck\\'s case  debatable, because that\\'s the standard. It\\'s debatable.  They don\\'t pause and say, you know, people have some  basis for an argument here? This is not frivolous.  This is a serious question.</p><p> Oral argument -- oral  argument on whether to grant the COA?\\n \\n38</p><p> That\\'s not the issue.  They are supposed to decide whether to grant COA or not  on whether the questions are serious or not, debatable,  not decide the merits.

I mean, the Spending  Clause operations are pretty clear. The Federal\\n \\n  government proposes a deal to the States. If the States  want the money, they have to agree to these provisions.  And now you\\'re saying that the content of those  provisions, though, is changed by new legislation.  And I just wonder whether that puts some  strain on the idea that the States have agreed to these  provisions when they accepted the offer under the  Spending Clause.</p><p> How does that work?</p><p> Thank you, counsel.

FISHER\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Significant - \"significant,\" \"meaningful,\" whatever. It\\'s more than  simply de minimis. It suggests that you can\\'t just look  at something and say, aha, here, that was helpful, that  was helpful, because it\\'s -- the whole package has got  to be helpful enough to allow the student to keep up  with his peers.</p><p> It didn\\'t just say  \"some benefit.\" It said that that benefit would  normally allow the -- a student with the disability to  keep up with his peers in a different grade.\\n \\n49  Now, as soon as they say that, you  appreciate that you\\'re dealing with more than just some  benefit. I mean, that\\'s a significant benefit. Well - (Laughter.)</p><p> It didn\\'t just  say -</p><p> It\\'s not exact -</p><p> Yeah, but you\\'re\\n\\n putting a lot -- you\\'re assuming that the procedural\\n\\n process will yield significant results. What if they do\\n\\n the whole thing? Yeah, we have a hearing. Everybody\\n\\n comes in. We bring the expert in and the expert says,\\n\\n well, you need to have somebody there six hours of the\\n\\n day to help the child learn, and they say, okay,\\n\\n that\\'s -- that\\'s the procedure, we listen to you. In\\n\\n fact, we\\'re only going to have somebody there a half\\n\\n hour a day.</p><p> Well, I guess it\\n\\n depends on whether somebody can tell us at some point\\n\\n whether it\\'s beneficial. And yet, I think most people\\n\\n would agree that it -- well, I mean, are you saying that\\n\\n the -- the judicial review is supposed to be whether\\n\\n that\\'s de minimis or more than de minimis, and they\\'re\\n\\n supposed to say, well, a half hour is -- is -- is good,\\n\\n \\n\\n it\\'s not de minimis, but that\\'s all you have to do?\\n\\n42</p><p> But, Mr. Katyal,  let\\'s say -- let\\'s say that during the school year, the  school districts -- district sends someone to work with  the particular student in this case, and they send her\\n \\n\\n there for two weeks, you know, she goes around. And\\n\\n41\\n\\n that\\'s it. And that\\'s all they do. That\\'s some\\n\\n benefit.

And I -- one reason I think that it -- it\\'s  problematic for you is because Rowley just doesn\\'t say  \"some benefit.\" It tells you what it is. And it\\'s\\n \\n36  enough benefit to keep track with grade progress. And  if that\\'s what the standard is, that\\'s certainly more  than -- you know, slightly more than de minimis.  And, now, obviously, we -- we -- you can\\'t  take that actual substantive standard and apply it in a  case such as this, but it does seem to indicate that  there is a substantive standard and it\\'s not just some  benefit.</p><p> It says \"some  benefit,\" but you\\'re -- you\\'re reading it as saying  \"some benefit,\" and the other side is reading it as  saying \"some benefit,\" and you know that - (Laughter.)</p><p> Thank you, counsel.

All right.\\n\\n Would you say -- I\\'ll ask the same thing of\\n\\n Mr. Fisher if he has a chance to address it.\\n\\n If -- if we were to look at what the lower\\n\\n courts have been doing -- we don\\'t see very many of\\n\\n these cases, the lower courts see a lot of them.

Now, \"progress\" benefit. Yeah, I don\\'t see  how you can have a benefit unless you\\'re making some  progress.  \"Significant,\" \"meaningful,\" they\\'re  synonyms. If something is significant or meaningful,  it\\'s more than de minimis. And if it\\'s more than de  minimis, you could say it\\'s significant. It\\'s something  that you note. So it\\'s really -- I mean, what everybody  seems to be looking for is the word that has just the  right nuance to express this thought.</p><p> What is frustrating about  this case and about this statute is that we have a  blizzard of words. And if you -</p><p> It makes a big difference  whether you take the word \"equal\" out though. What  you\\'ve just said takes the word \"equal\" out of the  standard.</p><p> Isn\\'t that -</p><p> Well, I understand what an\\n \\n  equal outcome would be, but I don\\'t understand what an  equal opportunity means when an equal outcome is not  practical.</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Okay.</p><p> We get that -- I mean, how\\n\\n does this actually work? I thought there is a statute\\n\\n in 1414 before that, it says you have to, school\\n\\n district, write an IEP. Then it says what an IEP is.\\n\\n And one of the things it says an IEP is, is it is a\\n\\n statement of the services, et cetera, based on peer\\n\\n review stuff that will be provided for the child to\\n\\n advance appropriately and to make progress in the\\n\\n general education curriculum.\\n\\n \\n54  Now, suppose the school district writes a  statement called an IEP, but it does not show that the  child is likely to advance. Can\\'t they go to the  administrative thing and then go to court and say to the  judge, look, they didn\\'t write what they were required  to write?</p><p> Why didn\\'t the -- why  didn\\'t the -- the statement that an IEP, what it has to  do is it has to, based on peer-reviewed research, when  practicable, will -- will be provided to the child to  advance appropriately towards attaining the annual goals  to make progress in the general education curriculum and  so forth. So you\\'ve just described if the situation is  that, wouldn\\'t that have been violated? Or if they  wrote the IEP that way, wouldn\\'t you be able to go to\\n \\n  court and say, look, there is their IEP and they didn\\'t  live up to it?  So you already have two arguments under the  statute, and the problem that\\'s working in my mind is if  we suddenly adopt a new standard, all over the country  we\\'ll have judges and lawyers and -- and -- and people  interpreting it differently and -- and -- so why isn\\'t  the present situation sufficient?</p><p> Well, suppose we have a  child who is a handicapped child, there\\'s a range of  people, and they can\\'t do much for them, but they can do  something for them. And if they can do something for  them, do it.</p><p> But if you, say, measure  that in terms of their ability to progress from grade to  grade, maybe some will; some won\\'t. And how does that  -- it seems to me the word \"appropriate\" tried to  recognize that. And -- and do you want to recognize  that? I mean, you can\\'t ask for more than is reasonable  for them to do. So -- so what -- what words do we use?</p><p> Uh-huh.</p><p> Well, I\\'m sorry if it  doesn\\'t happen. What are we supposed to do to make it  happen? I mean, you have a statute that certainly seems  to say that and you have a system for enforcement. And  how does us suddenly using this word \"equal\" -- you  know, the word \"equal\" has history from a lot of  different areas of law. And -- and what do you do with  a wide range of -- of disabilities, a huge range in  individual students and -- and -- do you see what I  foresee?</p><p> I foresee taking the money  that ought to go to the children and spending it on  lawsuits and lawyers and all kinds of things that are  extraneous. That is what\\'s actually bothering me.</p><p> Besides having nine people  who don\\'t know -- I mean, at least speaking for  myself -- don\\'t know that much about it, creating a new  standard out of legal materials which are at a distance  from the people, the children and the parents, who need  help.</p><p> And as you pointed out,  most courts have interpreted what I think is the correct  thing, they said benefit. Okay? And you say there is  really no problem. Okay? There is really no problem.  But there still is a problem with the language in a  handful of courts. And now we have an IEP statute which\\n \\n\\n again and again and again looks to progress.\\n\\n46\\n\\n So why is it making something up out of\\n\\n whole cloth --</p><p> -- simply to take that word\\n\\n from the IEP, which is enforceable anyway, and say, look\\n\\n at these two words of ambiguity, and we think we should\\n\\n interpret them in light of the IEP requirements, which\\n\\n are pretty close to what the SG suggests?</p><p> Uh-huh.</p><p> So I go back to look at two\\n\\n words. The IEP is filled with the word \"progress.\"\\n\\n There\\'s several. So the word \"progress\" seems like\\n\\n something that should be there.</p><p> All right. Now, that\\'s an  ambiguity.</p><p> The problem is you say\\n\\n leave it to us. You represent the Department of\\n\\n Education here. They at least have experience with it\\n\\n and we have far less. And so, obviously, I\\'m relying\\n\\n and must rely upon people who have connection with\\n\\n expertise. And I don\\'t want to do something that uses\\n\\n words that has effects that I have no idea.</p><p> You could say some benefit  or you could say some benefit.</p><p> That\\'s what we have -- we  have now. We have the words you\\'ve mentioned. They are  in old cases. As was just pointed out, those words  \"some\" -- what is it? \"Some\" -- \"some\" -- \"some  benefit.\"</p><p> All right.</p><p> Where is it? As I see one\\n\\n way of looking at what we\\'re doing, two things have\\n\\n occurred. One, Rowley itself is somewhat ambiguous. It\\n\\n doesn\\'t -- it deliberately doesn\\'t say how much, and\\n\\n that\\'s why you get the ambiguity.\\n\\n The second thing that happens is the statute\\n\\n is amended. So what we\\'re doing is going back and\\n\\n looking at those somewhat ambiguous words in Rowley in\\n\\n light of a statute that was amended.\\n\\n Now, when you look at the statute that was\\n\\n amended in the IEP, you do see in at least two and maybe\\n\\n more places that that IEP is designed to be a statement\\n\\n that will produce -- meet the child\\'s needs to enable\\n\\n the child to be involved in and make progress in the\\n\\n general education, and then further, advance\\n\\n appropriately towards an -- annual goals to make\\n\\n progress in the general education.\\n\\n So now what the SG has done is go back, take\\n\\n those words, \"make progress,\" and put them in a phrase\\n\\n which, in fact, I think with not much modification says,\\n\\n look, let\\'s read what Rowley said in light of these\\n\\n additional words, \"make progress,\" which are statutory\\n\\n words, while taking account of great differences by\\n\\n using words like \"appropriately in light of the\\n\\n \\n39  student\\'s particular needs and abilities,\" and those all  come from the statute.</p><p> And then the other word --</p><p> Not appropriate. Is\\n\\n that --</p><p> And if we stick\\n\\n \"appropriate\" in that sentence somewhere so it\\'s\\n\\n significant and appropriate, does that matter?</p><p> You looked into this and  you don\\'t -</p><p> -- see anything wrong with  sticking in the word \"appropriate\"?</p><p> So I\\'m thinking, well,  maybe it should be something like they are reasonably  calculated to provide.</p><p> -- that goes -- goes -- you\\n\\n see a lot is \"appropriate.\" Now, you\\'ve taken that word\\n\\n \"appropriate\" and spelled it out in light of the\\n\\n student\\'s particular needs and abilities. I think\\n\\n that\\'s what you\\'re doing with \"appropriate.\"</p><p> Okay. Now -- now, the  other thing I looked at in yours is you say the  school -- \"requires school districts to provide.\" And  when I see \"requires school districts to provide,\" I  begin to think everybody is going to start suing about  whether they did provide.</p><p> So they have to write  something that\\'s minimally -</p><p> Now, let\\'s suppose they  write it, but they don\\'t do it.</p><p> And so, again, they go to  court?</p><p> And what they -- again they  say they didn\\'t follow the IEP?\\n\\n \\n55</p><p> But they do have to provide  something that makes progress in the general education  curriculum and -</p><p> -- and advance  appropriately -</p><p> -- towards a -</p><p> It\\'s procedurally  calculated.</p><p> I don\\'t know. I would say  if you take Rowley as meaning -- hmm, or whatever those\\n \\n56  two words were, what, beneficial? What\\'s the one before  \"beneficial\"?</p><p> Some educational benefit.  If you say \"some,\" this is inconsistent with Rowley.</p><p> Now, isn\\'t there something  saying you have to follow the IEP?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>And it\\'s not in Rowley.\\n\\n So where does it -- who invented it?</p><p> Who -- who put the term,\\n\\n \"more than merely de minimis\"? That\\'s the formula that\\n\\n we\\'re -- that you are espousing.</p><p> So some with bite and\\n\\n more than de minimis don\\'t sound like equivalence to me.</p><p> One -- one aspect of - of your position is you say yes, there is a substantive  standard, some benefit. And then you, in the course of  your argument, said some, as interpreted by most courts,  has bite. But then you say de minimis is enough -- more\\n \\n\\n than de minimis is enough.\\n\\n53</p><p> So you\\'re -- you\\'re  equating some benefit to more than -</p><p> But would you agree with  at least the courts should say that the formulation more  than de minimis sets the level too low, and that\\'s - that\\'s the formula that was used at levels here.</p><p> But I think it doesn\\'t  say it\\'s more than de minimis.</p><p> So what is it?</p><p> Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, the  tab here is -- is at $70,000 tuition?</p><p> You don\\'t think \"some  benefit\" is ambiguous?</p><p> What did you -- what we\\n\\n were told by Mr. Fisher, I think he was referring to 79A\\n\\n of the government\\'s appendix.</p><p> The standard -- the  standard you\\'re asking us to adopt, substantially equal  opportunity, that does appear someplace. It appears in  Justice Blackmun\\'s concurring opinion in Rowley, and the  court itself did not adopt that formulation, did not  adopt substantially equal opportunity. So you\\'re asking  us to adopt a standard that the majority already had  before it and didn\\'t adopt.</p><p> How does that differ - how does your formulation differ from the one we were  just offered by Mr. Fisher?</p><p> We\\'re dealing here with a  child who -</p><p> But we\\'re dealing here -</p><p> Weren\\'t they going to - what -- the -- the conference that the parents didn\\'t  attend, they had scheduled a conference, and I thought a  behavioral expert was part of that conference.</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Mr. Katyal, can you go back\\n \\n58  to Justice Ginsburg\\'s question that I\\'m a bit confused  of -- about for the same reason.  You said something like, well, this -- this  standard is -- is being applied with bite. So I\\'m just  wondering, do you favor a standard with bite?</p><p> Mr. Katyal -</p><p> Do you favor a standard with  bite?</p><p> -- consider all of them and  we do none of them, that\\'s just fine?</p><p> But if we --\\n \\n51</p><p> That\\'s wrong. This is not  just a procedural guarantee. Yes, the IDEA has lots of  procedures in it, but they\\'re all geared towards a  particular substantive result. And it\\'s that  substantive result that\\'s the focus of the -- both the  administrative process and then judicial review of what  comes out of the administrative process.</p><p> Would that be \"some bite\" or  \"somebite\"?  (Laughter.)</p><p> But the back end is what\\n\\n this case is all about.</p><p> Well, again, if somebody  said to you, write a stature with -- write a standard  with bite, I doubt you would come up with the words  \"more than merely de minimis.\"</p><p> And de minimis is not\\n\\n enough, you know. It\\'s \"merely de minimis.\"\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> We are at the back end.</p><p> Well, how does your  position, Mr. Katyal -- you have a passage in your brief  on page 47 which says, \"An IEP must have the goal of  advancing a child in the general education curriculum  and, to the extent possible, enable her to be educated  in the school\\'s regular classes.\"\\n \\n50  And, to me, that sounds exactly like what  the chief justice just said, that an IEP has to be  reasonably calculated to do those things. And if it\\'s  not, then relief follows.</p><p> So we should come up with  our own that can then be applied in different ways in  different courts.  (Laughter.)</p><p> -- what would you say to  those of us? How would you describe what you think is  required without focusing on equality?</p><p> But for those of us who have  some feeling that the word \"equality\" is a poor fit for  this statute and its focus on individuation -</p><p> So that\\'s what the dispute  is ultimately going to be about. It might be about some  procedures along the way, and maybe it will be solved  just by saying follow the right procedures, but often\\n \\n\\n not. Often, what the hearing officer is told to do,\\n\\n34\\n\\n shall do, is to decide on substantive grounds whether a\\n\\n child has received a free appropriate public education.</p><p> But the procedures, as I\\'m  sure you\\'ll agree, is geared towards something. It\\'s  geared towards the provision of a free appropriate  public education.  Then the Act, what it does, is it sets up - this is why I -- I guess I -- I -- I can\\'t readily agree  with your understanding of it\\'s all procedures and we  just have to make sure the procedures are followed,  because what the Act does is it sets up an  administrative process. And it says when you have  disagreements about the provision of a -- of a FAPE, you  go to this administrative process.  And what does the hearing officer do? I\\'m  going to just read you, subject to another exception, \"A  decision made by a hearing officer shall be made on  substantive grounds based on a determination of whether  the child received a free appropriate public education.\"</p><p> But your substantive\\n\\n standard is so low, is so easy to meet, and then you\\n\\n justify that. You say, don\\'t worry about it because\\n\\n it\\'s all in the process.\\n\\n But this provision, the idea of what a\\n\\n hearing officer is supposed to do, and then what a court\\n\\n is supposed to do, says it\\'s not all in the process.\\n\\n There is a question of whether a student is receiving a\\n\\n -- a FAPE.\\n\\n \\n35</p><p> But for those -</p><p> How so -</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>So you say that there is  generally no consensus as to appropriate methodologies  for, say, a hearing-impaired student, an autistic  student. No agreement on that?</p><p> So we\\'ve gone -- so we\\'ve  gone nowhere.</p><p> Some -- some benefit.</p><p> \"Meaningful\" was a word  used in Rowley.</p><p> \"Meaningful\" -</p><p> And in your -- in your  position, what -- in your view, what should have been  done for this student?</p><p> But -- but do you think\\n\\n that costs should be measured against the possible\\n\\n results to be achieved?</p><p> So your answer to Justice  Kagan is yes. If you consider everything but do  nothing, that\\'s okay.</p><p> And -- and then I thought  I heard you say, well, the procedure we followed, that\\'s  good enough.</p><p> You\\'ll have to excuse me,  I\\'m not sure I understood your answer to the Chief  Justice.  He -- he had a hypothetical where you have  the hearing, the hearing makes a recommendation,  recommendation not followed. What result?</p><p> But -- but are -- are not\\n\\n the procedures subject to judicial review to see that\\n\\n the procedures were followed?</p><p> Then I don\\'t understand\\n\\n your disagreement with Mr. Fisher.</p><p> Well, do you agree that\\n\\n the procedures have to meet these standards?</p><p> Then why doesn\\'t that\\n\\n \\n\\n automatically make these part of the standards?\\n\\n32</p><p> But the procedural\\n\\n standards certainly are the measure by which a court can\\n\\n determine whether or not the procedures were adequate.</p><p> I suppose -- I suppose  it\\'s implicit in your standards and in some of the  provisions you read that what we\\'re talking about is the\\n \\n\\n word \"reasonable\" that we see throughout the law.\\n\\n\\n\\n Do -- do you see any -- any function for\\n\\n that word and, in addition, as part of what reasonable\\n\\n is, is there any place to discuss the cost that the --\\n\\n would -- would be incurred for, say, severely disabled\\n\\n students?</p><p> Mr. Katyal, are there - in the wake of the many years this Act has been enforced  and these many individual meetings, have there been  documented areas of consensus as to certain standards,  certain methodologies, certain systems that work and  certain that don\\'t? And do the courts, in reviewing  these proceedings, ever refer to those?</p>', 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': '<p>That\\'s not the case in\\n\\n this case.</p><p> And -- and more\\n\\n importantly, the cost gave significant progress.</p><p> The cost of the private\\n\\n education resulted in significant --</p><p> Well, here, even by the\\n\\n Tenth Circuit\\'s admission, this was barely de minimis\\n\\n progress.</p><p> So where do you get  \"some benefit\" from?</p><p> What do you do with  \"meaningful\" -</p><p> -- that was in Rowley  itself?</p><p> And I don\\'t mean to be  buying into your -</p><p> How about \"meaningful\"  instead of \"significant\"?</p><p> For all of us who might  be a little slow -</p><p> -- now tell me what the  new standard you\\'re proposing is.</p><p> What does that -</p><p> For all of us -</p><p> -- adversary\\'s position.

Mr. Dreeben.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</p><p> I don't know why - I don't know why you run away from the proposition that  less is better. I would have thought that's central to  your argument, and it's not. It sounds bad, but it's  not. I mean, maybe less was going to be more  susceptible to another challenge, like it's arbitrary.  But you can see that it's not a vagueness  problem. I mean, if you -- you know, the coin toss  proposition, if you say the sentence will be decided by  a coin toss, it's not vague. Everybody knows exactly  what's going to happen. But it might be arbitrary.  So in that case less would be better. If  you did not have the provision about a coin toss, which  narrows the uncertainty, then that would be better.</p><p> Well, if the\\n\\n indeterminate sentencing is all right, it would seem to\\n\\n me that even the vaguest guideline would be an\\n\\n improvement and so difficult to argue that it's too\\n\\n \\n vague to be applied.</p><p> Well, less and less,\\n\\n right? I mean, there are steadily increasing percentage\\n\\n of departures from the Guidelines.</p><p> We will hear  argument this morning in Case -8544, Beckles v. United  States.  Ms. Bergmann.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>Well, that seems to be a  lot -- a lot vaguer than what we have here. So how do  you -- how do you reconcile those two propositions?</p><p> Let me ask you a more -- let  me ask you a more fundamental question. And I don\\'t  want to unduly shock the attorneys who are here from the  Sentencing Commission, but imagine there were no  sentencing guidelines.  So you have a criminal provision that says  that a person who\\'s convicted of this offense may be  imprisoned for not more than  years. That\\'s all it  says.  Now, is that unconstitutionally vague?</p><p> But they did. So they - they were their words, and they interpreted their words  in the commentary.</p><p> But the Guidelines  provisions are the -- are the Commission\\'s words. Now,  they borrowed them from a statute, but they didn\\'t have  to do that?</p><p> Well, what if the -- the\\n\\n Guidelines themselves said that the term \"crime of\\n\\n violence\" means, among other things, burglary of a\\n\\n dwelling, arson, extortion, involves use of explosives,\\n\\n \\n  involves possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or otherwise  involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk  of physical injury to another?  Would there be a vagueness problem then?</p><p> But what will happen ten  years from now? Let\\'s say ten years from now when you  have -- there\\'s no district judge anymore who even  remembers the mandatory guideline regime and there are\\n \\n30  departures in 85 percent of the cases, and the judges go  through the drill. They -- you know, they calculate the  Guidelines and all of that, but then they go on and  impose the type of sentence that they think adequately  serves the legitimate purposes of sentencing. Would  your argument be the same then?</p><p> If I go through the  Sentencing Guidelines -- I mean, I just opened them at  random. I can see provisions that would generate a - you know, an arguable vagueness challenge if they were  in a criminal statute.  How about more than minimal planning? Do  you think that\\'s sufficiently -- that that\\'s  sufficiently clear to satisfy vagueness concerns if, you  know, you\\'re -- you\\'re guilty of this offense if it  involved more than minimal planning? Or the difference  between a serious bodily injury and a permanent or  life-threatening bodily injury?\\n \\n  And those are just -- I mean, just open this  at random.</p><p> So basically, your argument\\n\\n \\n is that there\\'s a continuum, so that if you have\\n\\n\\n\\n complete judicial discretion, barring the consideration\\n\\n of some impermissible invidious factor, within the\\n\\n statutory guideline range, there\\'s no vagueness problem.\\n\\n On the other hand, if you have mandatory\\n\\n guidelines, you may have to apply vagueness principles\\n\\n to the mandatory guidelines.\\n\\n Now, here it -- so someplace in the middle\\n\\n you get -- you are close enough to the mandatory that\\n\\n that has to apply. That\\'s -- that\\'s your argument?</p><p> Well, if advisory guidelines\\n\\n are subject to vagueness challenges, then surely\\n\\n mandatory guidelines would be subject to vagueness --</p><p> All right. So it\\'s for\\n\\n vagueness purposes.\\n\\n Now, suppose what the Court had said is the\\n\\n Guidelines are purely advisory. Now, you know,\\n\\n they\\'re -- the Sentencing Commission, very respected\\n\\n group, studied the problem; judges, you really ought to\\n\\n \\n  read them, you ought to take them into account, but in  the end, it\\'s your call, based on the factors that are  set out in the Sentencing Reform Act.  Would the result be the same?</p><p> Are you saying there\\'s more\\n\\n arbitrariness under this provision than there was under\\n\\n the pre-Sentencing Reform Act sentencing system, where a\\n\\n judge would pick a sentence between zero and  years\\n\\n based on that judge\\'s personal ideas about retribution,\\n\\n deterrence, and incapacitation?\\n\\n And in practice, there were judges who,\\n\\n under that system, always imposed a very light sentence\\n\\n for a particular offense and other judges who always\\n\\n imposed a heavy sentence for that particular offense.</p><p> That\\'s like jurisdiction,  that we are bound, we have no choice but to decide  retroactivity before deciding anything else.</p><p> Well, if I think that it\\'s\\n\\n retroactive, should I stop there, should I go on to\\n\\n consider whether it\\'s vague, or should I just accept\\n\\n your concession that it\\'s vague?\\n\\n \\n45</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>No, no, I\\'m not saying it\\'s  not that vague. It is that -- it is saying you can\\'t  rely on how sentencing used to work in order to save  this on-off rule.  Then what was worrying me in our  conversation is I could think of other parts of the  Guidelines; for example, the part that deals with  concurrent versus consecutive sentencing, which, you  know, is a nightmare and is also the notion of a kind of  on-off rule, and I\\'m afraid of what we would do here.  See, that\\'s where I a.m. in this. I mean, I\\'m not  saying don\\'t go ahead, go ahead. But I think he\\'s  trying to make a qualitative difference in what we\\'re  talking about here.</p><p> But his point, I think, is\\n\\n that, yes, all that you say is true, but this is a\\n\\n special kind of guideline. This is like a threshold.\\n\\n This is like a rule of law that says, get into this\\n\\n career offender business if and only if you satisfy this\\n\\n rule. Thus, most rules are telling the judge, Judge, go\\n\\n back to your history of what this is about. Look at the\\n\\n offender, figure out what he did, and then try to find\\n\\n an appropriate sentence in light of factors. This isn\\'t\\n\\n that.\\n\\n This is off/on. You either are in the\\n\\n career offender or you are not. And just as you\\n\\n couldn\\'t, even before, have decided the sentence through\\n\\n a throw of the dice, so you cannot now interpret an\\n\\n on-off rule to say it\\'s no worse than what you\\'re\\n\\n talking about.</p><p> We know that because this\\n\\n is -- the words I read you are just one set of what I\\n\\n bet are hundreds of examples in these Guidelines if you\\n\\n go through and think it doesn\\'t make too much sense.</p><p> Here\\'s a thing I\\'d like you\\n\\n to think about, and -- and tell me what you think. This\\n\\n \\n33  is -- this is what\\'s bothering me about the government\\'s  position. It\\'s important, the government\\'s position.  Put in your mind the words that we\\'re  talking about, \"or otherwise involves conduct that  presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\"  Okay? Those are the words. Put them over here; they  appear in the guideline. Put them over here; they  appear in the statute.  When they appear in the statute, they have a  meaning, and it\\'s fairly limited, and there\\'s likely to  be one. And eventually there will be an authoritative  meaning.  When it appears over here in the guideline,  it could be viewed as having an authoritative meaning or  it could be viewed as leaving up to the district judge  the job of interpreting these sensibly in the case, just  like we used to do.  And then the Commission goes around first to  review it for reasonableness at the court of appeals,  and then the Commission goes through the feedback  process that you -- that you describe.  Now, that would mean, one, a system that  works itself towards a more logical, sensible approach  in terms of punishment, and it also would mean that the  normal words vagueness in the Constitution, or, if you\\n \\n like, feed it through the statutory enabling\\n\\n34\\n\\n legislation, it would -- it would mean that it would\\n\\n have different meanings in the two constitutional versus\\n\\n statute versus guideline. But the purpose of that would\\n\\n be to get better guidelines.</p><p> But I have -- I have -- I\\'m\\n\\n conceding, because one way of clarifying the kind of\\n\\n vagueness that\\'s there in the statute is through\\n\\n example. If we\\'d had twenty examples instead of three,\\n\\n we might never had to get to that constitutional issue.\\n\\n So here, what the Commission did was provide\\n\\n some examples. That\\'s all. And one of the examples was\\n\\n a sawed-off shotgun.\\n\\n So why isn\\'t that sufficient? I mean, there\\n\\n was vagueness. Assume. Because similar reasons?\\n\\n Assume. And now we have an effort to cure. And the\\n\\n effort to cure is by giving examples. And why isn\\'t\\n\\n \\n that good enough?</p><p> And there is more\\n\\n arbitrariness because of this guideline than there was\\n\\n before the Guidelines were passed? Is there any\\n\\n evidence of that? I have a lot of evidence it wasn\\'t.</p><p> Especially so. Is it so at\\n\\n all? There was a system before the Guidelines exactly\\n\\n as Justice Alito said. Moreover, that system is\\n\\n existing today side by side with the Guidelines in any\\n\\n case in which the judge decides not to use the\\n\\n Guidelines.\\n\\n So I don\\'t get it. I really don\\'t. And you\\n\\n can be brief here, because it\\'s really the government\\n\\n that has to answer this question for me. I don\\'t\\n\\n understand where they\\'re coming from on this, and you\\n\\n don\\'t have to answer more than briefly, but I do have\\n\\n \\n exactly the same question that Justice Alito had.</p><p> This is -- this is a fairly\\n\\n deep question, actually, you\\'re going into, in my mind.\\n\\n And what is -- before I reached a constitutional\\n\\n question, I would ask whether the Guideline falls within\\n\\n the scope of the words \"Guideline-enabling statute.\" I\\n\\n don\\'t see why you have to get into the Constitution.\\n\\n But even doing it that way, it then becomes\\n\\n a matter of the extent to which the Federal courts are\\n\\n going to review the substantive Guidelines, itself an\\n\\n open question.\\n\\n So rather than get into that, I might think\\n\\n about your case like this: Why was the statute vague?\\n\\n It was vague because with three examples preceding the\\n\\n residual clause, they tried to apply it, Congress, to\\n\\n thousands of State criminal statutes that vary in a\\n\\n variety of ways one from the other. That\\'s what caused\\n\\n the problem, I think.\\n\\n Now, if that was the problem, that isn\\'t\\n\\n present here because these apply to Federal statutes.\\n\\n \\n Moreover, they don\\'t apply to State statutes. Oh,\\n\\n\\n\\n maybe -- I see. Yeah, yeah, you\\'re right. There is.\\n\\n You\\'re right. You\\'re right. I can\\'t get around it that\\n\\n way. Thank you for your answer.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> But let\\'s go -- let\\'s go a\\n\\n step further.</p><p> No, you\\'re -- you\\'re\\n\\n thinking the right thing.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>You would agree, would  you not, that, if the commentary counts, if it counts,  then there's nothing imprecise about possessing a  sawed-off shotgun; right?</p><p> Do we know that for sure?</p><p> Let me -</p><p> Let me ask you a question  that's peculiar to this case, and it's essentially  whether the issue we're now debating became moot when  this sentence was reduced to 216 months, which is well  below the Guidelines range.</p><p> And he got 216 months.</p><p> The third -- the third\\n\\n issue -- you've confused me by your argument. I thought\\n\\n from your brief that if we decide the first issue, that\\n\\n is, was there fair notice of the sawed-off shotgun, then\\n\\n there's no vagueness, and the case is over. But -- so I\\n\\n was thinking, well, we could decide that third issue and\\n\\n not reach either vagueness or retroactivity.</p><p> But would you say that is  not necessary if we agree that in this case there was  fair notice about the sawed-off shotgun being -</p><p> So his sentence, the - the Guideline range, what was it? 262 to 327 months?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>But the -- but suppose  there were a statute -- and this is a -- I don't mean to  interrupt, but this is part of Justice Ginsburg's\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Suppose there were a statute in Johnson, and\\n\\n it read just like the residual clause, that -- that an\\n\\n example of a dangerous offense is -- or an offense which\\n\\n creates a serious risk is the possession of a sawed-off\\n\\n shotgun. That was in the statute.</p><p> Would the statute then be\\n\\n valid?</p><p> In the shotgun case.</p><p> Yes, it would be valid.</p><p> Well, you didn't answer\\n\\n Justice Ginsburg's question. Why can't the Sentencing\\n\\n Commission, the agency, do that?</p><p> Well, but your argument  applies to State systems as well, and you're telling us  that the more specific a legislature or an agency tries  to make guidance for the judge, the more chance there is  for vagueness. And the statute, Section 3553 itself of   U.S.C., they talk about the characteristics of the  defendant. Okay. Seriousness of the offense. Okay.</p><p> Your argument is sweeping.

Why is that substantive?</p><p> It appears that you're\\n\\n taking two different positions on these points.</p><p> Well, but you say the\\n\\n vagueness challenge analysis applies because this whole\\n\\n class is affected.</p><p> And that seems to me\\n\\n inconsistent with saying that they're procedural because\\n\\n they don't play a dispositive role.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>Even the -- where the  circuits said no retroactivity -- where they have  permitted retroactivity?</p><p> But they've been  resentencing?</p><p> If I were a district\\n\\n court judge and I wasn't going to change the sentence no\\n\\n matter what -- what the reason for the retroactivity\\n\\n ruling, I would have just had the sentence.</p><p> I was known for that.\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> I'm sorry. It wasn't  arbitrary to the judge at issue -</p><p> What was arbitrary was  that one judge could have put different values on a  reason in one place and -- in New York and different  values in California. That's a very different form of  arbitrariness.</p><p> -- meaning, the judge at  issue always had his or her own reasons.</p><p> Mr. Dreeben, what will  happen to all those cases that have been resentenced  already?\\n \\n43</p><p> Perhaps if we go back to  the process here. The Guidelines were passed, including  the residual clause at one point in time; correct?</p><p> Was it the Commission?  Aren't those amendments approved by Congress?</p><p> That's my question. So  the commentary is not approved by Congress, and that  commentary that added the sawed-off shotgun, was it  simultaneous with the adoption of the residual clause to  define crime of violence?</p><p> And so Guidelines that  you're being asked to apply to specific facts are\\n \\n reviewable by a court, aren't they?\\n\\n\\n\\n We can look at the facts and say, was the\\n\\n judge right? Was this more than minimal planning or\\n\\n not?\\n\\n Correct?</p><p> Mr. Dreeben, can we go\\n\\n back to Justice Kennedy's question? In Montgomery, we\\n\\n had a rule that appeared procedural, just like this one.\\n\\n The judge at sentencing could still sentence the\\n\\n defendant to life without parole after a particular\\n\\n finding, i.e., that the individual was irredeemable.\\n\\n Why is that different than here? Meaning,\\n\\n if the Guidelines are procedural in the Montgomery sense\\n\\n because they are an anchor on what a judge does, why\\n\\n isn't there a substantial risk like in Montgomery that a\\n\\n defendant is going to be sentenced because of the\\n\\n Guideline and not because of a finding that he or she is\\n\\n \\n entitled to that sentence?\\n\\n38\\n\\n And I take that to be -- that substantial\\n\\n risk to be proven by your own statistic. 80 percent of\\n\\n judges sentence within the Guidelines. But more\\n\\n importantly for those circuits that have permitted or --\\n\\n or have applied retroactive activity to Johnson and\\n\\n defendants have been resentenced, the vast majority have\\n\\n received a much lower sentence.</p><p> But doesn't a judge\\n\\n still have to make a finding that there's a reason to\\n\\n give a defendant a higher sentence? There may be some\\n\\n judges who determine the nature of the past conduct\\n\\n qualifies this defendant for career criminal status, but\\n\\n absent that, it seems like the vast majority of those\\n\\n judges who are now resentencing don't believe that\\n\\n those -- that prior criminal history justifies the\\n\\n higher sentence.</p><p> Could I just ask\\n\\n something? If we rule in your favor and say it's not\\n\\n retroactive, how much is left of the Johnson ruling?\\n\\n What effect would it have? How many cases are there in\\n\\n fact, except the -- I guess it's the felon in possession\\n\\n \\n cases would be the one example that the Guideline --\\n\\n40\\n\\n that the Guidelines haven't already been structured to\\n\\n take care of all career offenders.</p><p> Outside of felon and\\n\\n possessions --</p><p> -- can you think of any\\n\\n other situations?</p><p> You're not quite\\n\\n answering my question. What other situations besides\\n\\n the felon in possession would Johnson and Welch be\\n\\n operative? Because as I understand it, in virtually all\\n\\n cases, most others, the Guidelines are within the\\n\\n statutory maximum.</p><p> Wasn't the essence of  our ruling in Johnson that it's one thing to ask a judge  to apply a determination to existing facts, as opposed  to what happens with the residual clause, which is  you're asking a judge to basically fantasize about what  the average case is like?</p><p> But it's almost\\n\\n impossible, according to Johnson, to find what an\\n\\n ordinary case would look like because there was no\\n\\n standard of comparison of what ordinary meant.</p><p> There are -- there are\\n\\n circuit courts who already permit vagueness challenges\\n\\n to provisions, right?</p><p> Was this -</p><p> Was this 40 percent\\n\\n normal for this judge? Did he say he was basing it on a\\n\\n percentage?</p><p> Well, why is this -- I\\n\\n guess the real question on this last point is: If what\\n\\n we're trying to do is to regulate the defendant's\\n\\n conduct, not possessing this thing or not committing a\\n\\n crime of violence, and he knows because the commentary\\n\\n tells him that if he does possess a sawed-off shotgun,\\n\\n \\n  he's going to get this enhancement, what's arbitrary at  sentencing for imposing what the defendant already knows  is illegal or will subject him to the greater  enhancement?  I buy your argument in terms of it would be  arbitrary to the Johnson reasoning to have a judge  determine that a sawed-off shotgun -</p><p> -- is violent in one  situation but not in another. But if the issue of  arbitrariness is the arbitrariness and capriciousness of  enforcement, here the defendant knew that he was going  to be subject to the enhancement at the time he  committed the crime.</p><p> I agree no discretion to  apply the Guideline. But -</p><p> How is this different\\n\\n from all of the examples the government gave in pages 55\\n\\n to 57 or the others where we've had a vague statute and\\n\\n the administrative agency has narrowed it, or you have a\\n\\n municipal ordinance that narrows, that the city narrows\\n\\n in its administrative processes? And all of those cases\\n\\n when they are challenged for vagueness, we look at how\\n\\n the statute is applied to the individual.\\n\\n How is this situation any different? If the\\n\\n statute was vague, it's vague. And what we've done\\n\\n instead is say, no, it's not vague, because the agency\\n\\n has narrowed its application.</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.

It shows that you're a member of the cheerleading squad  and -</p><p> Your -- the argument  is not that it makes the room or whatever look better.

If  you take the design of a particular cheerleading uniform  and put it on the lunchbox or the computer cover, yes,  those can be copyrighted.

I have a\\n\\n conceptual question. I\\'m not yet satisfied with your\\n\\n answer to the practical question because I fear that any\\n\\n good designer or lawyer could go and take any dress or\\n\\n suit, just about, and produce a picture that looks very\\n\\n much like that and then sue the companies that use the\\n\\n same dress or style. That\\'s my practical, but this is\\n\\n the conceptual.\\n\\n Since we can take -- since we can take\\n\\n anything -- anything -- to a two-dimensional picture and\\n\\n put it on the wall like Marcel Duchamp, if I decide in\\n\\n your favor, am I not allowing copyright for virtually,\\n\\n assuming other things satisfied, every design of a\\n\\n useful article, the very thing that Congress said they\\n\\n did not want?</p><p> I\\'m not talking about the\\n\\n shovel at the moment. I am talking about an artist\\'s\\n\\n ability to take a piece of clothing, which is a\\n\\n utilitarian object, and do a two-dimensional picture of\\n\\n \\n38  the piece of clothing, which it has some things on it,  some chevrons, or nothing. It just looks like a dress.  Now on your theory, does that not become copyrightable?</p><p> What about the woman or the  man who wishes -- and, indeed, this is a normal reason  for wearing clothes -- they are making a statement about  themselves? They\\'re saying who they are? The clothes  on the hanger do nothing; the clothes on the woman do  everything. And that is, I think, what fashion is  about.</p><p> It always has been in  history. Now, isn\\'t that a -- what?</p><p> Why do we wear robes?</p><p> What about Lemley\\'s -</p><p> What about Lemley\\'s test on  page  of his brief? As I -- as I read it, as I read  it and I thought -- and I\\'m sure you\\'ve read it -- and  it seemed to me that it does say that a two-dimensional  picture of a three-dimensional piece of clothing is not  entitled to copyright because it is not a design of  anything but a utilitarian object, the clothes, whether  they are beautiful clothes, ugly clothes, cheerleader,  or anything else.</p><p> But do you agree with  Lemley\\'s statement, which, I mean, it\\'s such an -- all  the professors are there -</p><p> -- and that\\'s why I thought  probably you\\'ve read it. And it\\'s from all over the  country, and I wanted to get your opinion of it.</p><p> Well, before you get away  from that, one thing very quick, because maybe I really  agree with you.</p><p> I had looked at page  of  your brief at figure . And what I had seen there when  I took the arms away was a picture of a thing that was a  picture of the cut and style and not just a picture of  chevrons. And so -- but if that\\'s what it is, then you  would agree and I would agree that it\\'s not -- everybody  would agree, I guess, it\\'s not copyrightable.</p><p> It\\'s not. So you have a\\n\\n different design. So we are not talking about -- about\\n\\n \\n36  figure eight. We are not talking about figure eight.</p><p> Well, I see it here, and as\\n\\n I look at it and cut away the wings, I have left -- this\\n\\n is page  of the ASG\\'s brief -- what I have left is, I\\n\\n have left the design you\\'re after. It is a\\n\\n two-dimensional design that looks to me very much like a\\n\\n dress. It looks very much like a two-dimensional\\n\\n picture of a dress that covers a woman\\'s body. Now, did\\n\\n you -- that\\'s what you want to copyright, that thing --</p><p> And mine is about all\\n \\n dresses, all clothes, that\\'s all suits.\\n\\n35</p><p> But the point, the question  is, I think, if I -- because I have exactly the same  question. And it starts with the premise that  everything has a design. Some -- really, a lot of that  set can be copyrighted. All women\\'s clothes have  design. All men\\'s clothes have design. For a hundred  and more-than-that years, the fashion industry has not  enjoyed copyright protection. It is an industry on the  women\\'s side, I believe, that 225 billion dollars, at  least, worth of clothes are sold every year. If  suddenly in this case we say that dresses are  copyrightable, and they are because every one of them  has some design, perhaps we\\'ll double the price of  women\\'s clothes. Now if that\\'s -- that\\'s, I think, the  thrust of the question, and that is a practical  question.  I also have a conceptual question which I\\'d  like to ask, but why don\\'t you disabuse me of my notion  that we are into monopoly big-time?</p><p> That\\'s it.</p><p> That\\'s your point. That\\'s  your point.</p><p> And then if you fail on  that, you have all the specialized arguments about\\n \\n special purposes of cheerleader costumes.</p><p> But the basic argument is\\n\\n what I said; is that right?</p><p> Is that right?</p><p> Well, why not? It says,\\n\\n separable from, so we look to see if it\\'s separable\\n\\n from.</p><p> What else do we have --</p><p> So what happens if when you  look at the picture that they submit to the Copyright  Office and try to figure out if it\\'s separable what you  see is a picture of a dress that goes around a woman  which does look like, you know, shape and cut and so\\n \\n\\n52</p><p> -- but our imagination?</p><p> True, true.</p><p> All right. And this --</p><p> All right. Now, you\\'d say,  I take it, that when I\\'ve tried to identify the design  separately, I\\'ve ended up with something that is not  capable of existing independently of the -- of the  \"utilitarian aspects\" of the dress, because it looks  like a dress. So when Marcel Duchamp has a shovel on  the wall and says it\\'s a work of art, he can have a  copyright as long as he doesn\\'t try to sue people who  make shovels.</p><p> Forget the special things.  I have a picture of a dress now. The dress is in my  mind. I have abstracted it. When I look at those forms  in space, it looks like a dress.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>What about the Galiano\\n\\n case? That was the casino uniform. Why is that\\n\\n different from the cheerleader uniform?</p><p> How do we decide that  it's -- how do we decide that it's the design that makes\\n \\n60  it what it is, as opposed to the cut of the garment, the  shape, the pleats or whatever, the tightness of the top?  What -- why should we say that -- that this  two-dimensional design, which could be put on many  things, is what makes this article utilitarian?

Is that -- is there -- there any difference  between the tuxedo shirt and this?</p><p> No. But it prevents you --\\n\\n it prevents you from making this T-shirt with these\\n\\n lines on it in the same way that you\\'re saying nobody\\n\\n should be able to make a short dress --</p><p> -- with those particular\\n\\n lines in that particular place.</p><p> But you\\'re saying you\\n\\n \\n  couldn\\'t make the tuxedo shirt -- is that correct? -- or  you could?</p><p> So but if I could just go  back and make sure I understand my question about the  tuxedo shirt.</p><p> If I have a copyright in the  design of the tuxedo shirt, not in a tuxedo -</p><p> -- I have a copyright in the  design of a tuxedo shirt, can I prevent other people  from manufacturing tuxedo shirts?</p><p> So why isn\\'t that exactly  the same?</p><p> Because here, I have a  design in a copyright dress, and now I\\'m trying to  prevent other people from manufacturing that cheerleader  dress with that design.</p><p> I don\\'t understand why it\\'s  like manufacturing a tuxedo. It seems as though it\\'s  like manufacturing the thing that I have the design in.  I have design in the -- I have a design of a tuxedo  shirt, so you can\\'t make a tuxedo shirt. I have a  design in a cheerleader dress, so you can\\'t make the  cheerleader dress.</p><p> Well, I guess that\\'s the  question, is it really in any way, because the opposite  way of reading this statute is that the \"utilitarian  aspects\" of the article that you\\'re talking about in  terms of the separability test?</p><p> That -- that those  \"utilitarian aspects\" should be understood to encompass  only the utilitarian functions that make something a  useful article in the first place, which means that they  should be held to exclude things that relate to the - portraying the appearance of the article or things that  relates to conveying information, and that seems to me a\\n \\n  pretty good -- I mean, it\\'s a confusing statute, but it  seems to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this  statute.  But that is what this statute is trying to  do, is to say there are certain kinds of things that  might in a broad sense be considered utilitarian, which  has to do with portraying appearance or conveying  information, that, for this inquiry, we want you to  exclude, that the separability test does not relate to  those kinds of things.</p><p> But the reason why  camouflage is such a good example for your side is that  camouflage actually -- we can understand it as having a  utilitarian function that is different from simply  conveying information and it is different from simply  making something appear a certain way.</p><p> In other words, the  utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you  in the woods.</p><p> And so -- so that function  would not be excluded by these things.</p><p> Mr. Jay, see --</p><p> Mr. Jay, can I -</p><p> And isn\\'t it -- just  starting from the premise that Justice Alito suggested,\\n \\n the -- fabric designs are copyrightable; is that\\n\\n39\\n\\n correct?</p><p> Everybody agrees with that.</p><p> So it seems to me that the\\n\\n question, right, in this case, is are you going to treat\\n\\n this kind of design just as you would a fabric design?</p><p> And as I understand\\n\\n Mr. Bursch\\'s point, what Mr. Bursch is saying is, no,\\n\\n you shouldn\\'t, because this kind of design has -- it --\\n\\n it follows the figure of a human body, essentially. And\\n\\n that\\'s the difference between just a design of like\\n\\n stripes and zigzags and chevrons sort of abstractly, and\\n\\n then one that\\'s put on something that looks like a\\n\\n particular piece of apparel that\\'s meant to fit onto a\\n\\n human body in a particular way.\\n\\n And that seems to me to be the -- the\\n\\n distinction he\\'s making, and I want you to tell me why\\n\\n that distinction, in your view, doesn\\'t make a\\n\\n difference.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Suppose you have a Picasso\\n\\n painting or Mondrian or Klee, and suppose they're alive\\n\\n and they licensed the use of their picture on a garment\\n\\n and it does just what you say: This Picasso painting or\\n\\n Mondrian just completely captures the shape of the\\n\\n article you want.

They\\'ll talk on their own and tell me -- that\\n\\n this isn\\'t obvious and -- and some of your amici brief\\n\\n seemed to take that position, that if all we\\'re looking\\n\\n at is a picture of this color blocks and stripes, that\\n\\n it may be too obvious to qualify for copyright\\n\\n protection, or not original enough, whatever.\\n\\n But my point is that they already have done\\n\\n that. They\\'ve taken the designs and not put it on a\\n\\n cheerleading uniform. They\\'ve put it on sweats.\\n\\n They\\'ve put it on both tops and bottoms.\\n\\n So what does that do for you?</p><p> Does the university that\\n\\n contracts with you know that they have to buy their\\n\\n uniform for you -- from you for 99 years plus whatever?\\n\\n Every university that you sell these cheerleading\\n\\n uniforms to, do they know that under your copyright,\\n\\n they are stuck with you forever?</p><p> How about the gorilla, a\\n\\n gorilla\\'s hand around your -- one of the pictures in --</p><p> So you\\'re saying none --\\n\\n even if you find a color rainbow of some weird elk that\\n\\n could never be copyrighted, because --</p><p> You believe that --</p><p> Certain kinds make you\\n\\n look fatter --</p><p> -- because they can\\n\\n always be applied in a way that has a function.</p><p> On those pictorial\\n\\n representations --</p><p> Before we are going much\\n\\n further, you\\'re now saying that any -- you\\'re saying\\n\\n there is no copyright on those things.</p><p> No, they are not.</p><p> But the colors do.

How -- how does that\\n\\n actually happen?</p><p> Well, I\\'ll pick up\\n\\n Justice Alito\\'s question, then.\\n\\n Is there any indication that Congress was\\n\\n aware of those court of appeals decisions?</p><p> We don\\'t doubt that  if the -- the mandatory minimums were out of the picture\\n \\n\\n and all we had was the underlying offense here, that\\n\\n\\n\\n this sentence would be reversed on appeal, do you?</p><p> We\\'ll hear argument  this morning in Case -9260, Dean v. United States.  Mr. Stoler.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> I\\'m -- I\\'m going to\\n\\n let you get back to a fuller answer to Justice Breyer.\\n\\n But that certainly cuts against you, the idea that they\\n\\n recognize that, yes, you do have to look to the\\n\\n mandatory minimums. You should take that into account\\n\\n in imposing the sentence. And now you say when it gets\\n\\n down to what the actual sentence is, you can\\'t look at\\n\\n the mandatory minimums at all.</p><p> Well, I --</p><p> If you think the\\n\\n case is resolved at a higher level, it seems to me that\\n\\n your -- your friend has a very good technical argument\\n\\n \\n45  that says these sentences have to run concurrently. One  day, they run concurrently, end of case.  And your argument is, you know, you look at  the drafting history, the commentary to 2K2., all the  other arguments you got and you make -- make -- and the  basic one is well, that\\'s technically correct, but it\\'s  obviously not what Congress had in mind. Congress  obviously had in mind adding the mandatory onto a normal  sentence, one way or another, under -- under the  guidelines in 30 and all the provisions we\\'ve been  talking about.  So if you view the case that way,  technically correct, you know, contrary to the obvious  policy, what -- what case can you give me that tells us  how to approach a conflict like that?</p><p> What\\'s your - what\\'s your best case when you have a very significant  sanction in the balance, and you have technical  compliance on one hand, but clearly contrary to purpose?</p><p> Well, I understand  that.</p><p> Well, but then there  are also these basic rules they -- I mean, you insist  when citizens deal with the government that they turn  square corners, and I think it\\'s right for a criminal  defendant when they\\'re facing 30 additional years to  insist that the government turn square corners.</p><p> Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n \\n\\n Five minutes, Mr. Stoler.\\n\\n52\\n\\n REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n The case is submitted.\\n\\n (Whereupon, at :02 a.m., the case in the\\n\\n above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p>', 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>You don't want to say that\\n\\n because --\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> -- nobody but me would agree\\n\\n with you.</p><p> Do you think it matters that  it's a 30-year mandatory minimum? What if it was a  one-year mandatory minimum. Would the result be\\n \\n\\n different?\\n\\n54</p><p> It would? Really?</p><p> A year and a day would be\\n\\n okay?</p><p> So we're in this kind of\\n\\n weird -- we're -- we're in this weird world that this\\n\\n Court has created where the guidelines are advisory, but\\n\\n then they're not advisory, and so that's why we have\\n\\n this problem; is that correct?</p><p> At a minimum, you would have\\n\\n had a very tough argument. On the other hand, if this\\n\\n case had arisen before we decided Booker, if you read\\n\\n the guidelines correctly -- and it does seem to be --\\n\\n they do seem to say what you say they say -- then you\\n\\n would clearly be correct.</p><p> If this case had arisen\\n\\n before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted, I -- I\\n\\n think that Dean's argument would certainly be correct,\\n\\n would it not?</p><p> The judge would have\\n\\n complied with the statute, the term wasn't consecutive,\\n\\n and other than that, it was discretionary. So it was\\n\\n completely within the judge's discretion.</p><p> I thought that you were -- I  thought that your answer to the Chief Justice was  perhaps telling, because you said that you thought that  were it not for 924(c), this would be an unreasonable  sentence under -- under 3551 and 3553.  Isn't -- wasn't that your answer?</p><p> And doesn't that show that  Congress, although it generally conferred on district  courts the authority under those provisions to determine  what is a reasonable sentence in light of the enumerated  factors, withdrew that discretion with respect to the  component that is covered by 924(c)?  So if that's what the -- if that's what  Congress was doing, then why shouldn't that entire  sentence be ruled out in determining the sentence that  is reasonable under the count that is not governed by  924(c)?</p><p> And you think that's a\\n\\n realistic -- a realistic assessment of the way a\\n\\n legislative body works? They -- so we put this in\\n\\n 924(c). Then we put stronger language in 1028, and now\\n\\n we're amending 924. And, well, maybe we better\\n\\n strengthen 924 to make it in line with 1028.\\n\\n Did they have any reason to think about that\\n\\n at the time when they amended 924?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>But the basic reason was he\\n\\n thought that the mandatory was long enough.</p><p> No. This is a statute.  And the statute says, Judge, if you want to depart  downward, you can do so if you're applying the  guidelines only for a reason -- the words are, to repeat  them, a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree  not adequately taken into consideration by the  sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines.  I'm not giving you an answer. It's not a  hostile question; it's not a friendly question. It's a  question I'd like to know the answer to.</p><p> All right. And he went\\n\\n from there to one day.\\n\\n And 3553(b) says you have to -- I don't know\\n\\n if it's still law -- have to impose a guideline sentence\\n\\n unless the court finds there exists here a mitigating\\n\\n circumstance of a kind or to a degree not adequately\\n\\n taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in\\n\\n formulating the guideline.\\n\\n So you'd look and see their guideline says\\n\\n 48 months, and they departed down to a day for the\\n\\n reason that there was this add-on sentence, the\\n\\n mandatory.\\n\\n Now, is there anything that suggests that\\n\\n the commission did not have that in -- take that into\\n\\n account? In other words, is it a proper factor for\\n\\n departure, viewed not now from what Congress intended,\\n\\n not viewed from the point of view of the statutes you've\\n\\n \\n  been referring to, but viewed simply from the view of  the commission and the Congress as to when you can  depart downward?</p><p> Right.</p><p> All right. He didn't\\n\\n depart from the guidelines. He didn't -- but he did\\n\\n depart from the guideline sentence, which was 48 months\\n\\n or 44 months.</p><p> This is something that a  direct answer to, because the statutes have changed so  quickly that I may have lost track. But the -- but the  3553(b) is what I'm looking at, and that talks about  departures. And I take it that the sentence for robbery  was a departure. The -- the guideline recommendation  for -- and you did sentence the judge under the  guidelines; correct?</p><p> But the basic reason, I\\n\\n think it's fair to say, is he thought the mandatories\\n\\n were long enough.</p><p> Let -- let me assume that\\n\\n then. And it seems to me as if I hadn't thought that\\n\\n through till this moment, and I still haven't, the\\n\\n relation of 50 -- 3553(b). It may be you haven't\\n\\n \\n  thought it through either. Maybe nobody has, but -- but  I mean -- and maybe there isn't one, but -- but I -- I  wanted to learn as much as I could if there is a  relevance of that.</p><p> I -- I know 3553(a). That  isn't a problem for me.  What I'm trying to think of is maybe this is  a matter that lies in the hands of the commission.  Maybe you could say, well, the commission didn't say you  couldn't depart for that reason and, therefore, it is a  factor, a mitigating factor not considered by the  commission, but maybe the commission, should it choose  to do so, could consider it and could say when it could\\n \\n\\n and when it couldn't be, in which case the judge\\n\\n\\n\\n couldn't depart downward. You see, that -- that's --\\n\\n that's what's going through my mind and there's no point\\n\\n repeating myself. You thought -- you might have thought\\n\\n about it, you might not have. It's a little bit of a\\n\\n side issue.</p><p> It didn't say --</p><p> If think that, then you\\n\\n win; that's the end of it.</p><p> Yeah, yeah.</p><p> A reasonable thing to give  him one day.</p><p> It's in -- it's in the  other part, it's a reasonable thing given this  individual who may suffer certain individual things, da,  da, da.</p><p> If -- if you -- if you're  in the realm of what's reasonable and the judge is  looking at, well, you are under the appellate provision  because he's varied from the guidelines, of course, you  have to give the mandatory minimum, there it is, the  gun,  years. And now the judge thinks, you know, this  is way beyond what this guy did. It's fine for the gun,  but his total conduct here was -- doesn't warrant such a  long sentence.</p><p> And now -- now, what about  looking -- looking to see what the commission said about  it, noting that this is an individual case, not general,  not general where the district court has more power or\\n \\n\\n other things. Now you tell me. Those are floating\\n\\n44\\n\\n around in my mind. I'd like to know what's floating\\n\\n around in your mind.</p><p> So that's the -- that's  the -- the question in this case beyond the case is  really, how do we do that? And so -- so what I would  try out is, it would be obvious if you're right and the  statute is clear; okay? The -- the 924(c). Then you  win. That's the end of it. That's what you think. I  don't think it's clear.  If it's not clear, what do we do?</p><p> Correct, correct, correct.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Yeah, I think it is too.  Okay. So now -</p><p> Over -- what -- what is  it -- there's a word in the appellate part when they're  doing the review. Is it reasonable or -- you know, I'll  look it up.</p><p> -- on the appellate part.\\n\\n \\n43</p><p> Now, if we had the\\n\\n guidelines there -- try this. If the guidelines were\\n\\n here, it wouldn't be such a problem, because they would\\n\\n have -- the commission could look into this and it could\\n\\n take the factor into account. And then we'd have\\n\\n 3553(b) and we'd follow that in the future unless it's\\n\\n irrational.\\n\\n But they're out the window. Okay. They're\\n\\n out the window because it was a variance. So now we're\\n\\n left with 924(c), you know, the statute, and we're also\\n\\n left with the provision that says that a -- a court of\\n\\n appeals has to look at a departure or a variance and see\\n\\n if it's reasonable. Is that the right word? Reasonable\\n\\n or rational or something. What's the word?</p><p> That's -- that's what I'm\\n\\n trying -- I'm not criticizing, not criticizing. I'm\\n\\n trying to figure out what's the right system, putting\\n\\n this case aside.</p><p> My fault, not your fault.</p><p> No. And that's harder for  you. It's harder for you, because after all, if it's a  variance, he's not applying the guidelines. If he's not  applying the guidelines, all this stuff in the  guidelines that supports you is out the window. And - and -- including the sentence I read. And if it's out  the window, all we're trying to do is back where we  started, is the statute -- does the statute, which  doesn't mention this, forbid it, or is it otherwise  unfair?</p><p> No. He varied here. He  varied.\\n \\n33</p><p> Yeah. Yeah. That's -</p><p> Yeah. Yeah.</p><p> Maybe I'll find it.</p><p> Right --\\n\\n \\n32</p><p> 5G?</p><p> Where? Where? I mean,\\n\\n I -- my quick reading of , I promise I didn't memorize\\n\\n the guidelines. I used to know them pretty well, but I\\n\\n don't know them perfectly, by any means, and never did.\\n\\n But it seems to me that comment  in 2K2.\\n\\n is saying that -- that defendant, you have committed a\\n\\n crime, and in our guideline as punishment for the crime,\\n\\n part of it is increased because you had a gun. And so\\n\\n if we're going to apply the mandatory over here, which\\n\\n is our special statute here, don't apply that. But I\\n\\n don't see anything there that says you can't subtract.</p><p> You look at .. I missed\\n\\n it. Where -- where is the place on --</p><p> Where did you take this?\\n\\n Where.</p><p> Where?</p><p> I know you do.</p><p> And therefore the language  allows it. The language allows it, and indeed the  theory allows it, because the theory is you could have a  person there who's convicted of  multiple counts, you  know, and -- and the judge is given considerable power  to work all this out so that you have overall a fair  sentence. All right? That's the whole argument.  So what's your response?</p><p> It didn't say it anywhere.\\n\\n This is not taken into account by the commission, unless\\n\\n \\n  you can tell me there's a guideline on this particular  application of the mandatory minimum. And the statute  and the guidelines both say a judge can depart for a  reason not taken adequately into consideration by the  commission.  So unless you can point to me someplace  where they take this into consideration, although they  might in the future, I would say they didn't take it  into consideration at all.</p><p> Well, I was thinking of at  a deep level of what Thomas Reed Powell said about the  law. He wants us to think of this second part, you  know, as related, but really no. Look at the second  part, keep it totally separate, and the statute means  that the part about robbery has to be done separately.  Reed Powell said if the -- you can think of a thing that  is inextricably related to another thing without  thinking of the thing to which it is inextricably  related, you then have the legal mind.  (Laughter.)</p><p> That's what he wants us to  do. He says that's what the statute requires.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>-- the district court can  enlarge the original sentence for the predicate offense.</p><p> But the government must  recognize that 924(c) can influence the sentence on the  predicate offense because -- I think I'm correct in  saying the government takes the position if 924(c) drops  out if it's not proved, then when it goes back to the  district court -</p><p> We don't have -</p><p> Just adding one day.</p><p> Is -- is the -- 924(c) is  a statute, it's nothing to do with the guidelines, and  it does say sentences have to be consecutive. So I go  back to the point I opened with. You are, in effect,  asking for a concurrent sentence.</p><p> The -- the sentencing  judge did depart downward considerably, because the  guideline range was -</p><p> -- here, as in -</p><p> But what about --</p><p> So it was a\\n\\n significant -- it was a significant departure.</p><p> -- what was suggested. He  departed downward to 40 from -- what was the range?</p><p> But what about Judge\\n\\n Lucero's point that Congress can do a\\n\\n belt-and-suspenders operation, as if -- that there\\n\\n was -- there was additional insurance in 1028, doesn't\\n\\n \\n\\n mean that 924(c) shouldn't be read to have a real\\n\\n\\n\\n sentence for the predicate offense?</p><p> But it's  years later,\\n\\n right?</p><p> You said nothing in\\n\\n 924(c), but there is a bar on concurrent sentencing.\\n\\n And reading the statute the way you do would shrink the\\n\\n concurrency to the vanishing point if we add only one\\n\\n day to the 924(c) sentence.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Counsel --</p><p> But I don\\'t think you have  to go to a principle of lenity for Mr. Stoler to be  right. I mean, you were just saying this is very much  along the lines of what the Chief Justice was saying.  You would just say something like, look, if we\\'re going  to be strictly textualist here, this does not have the  kind of requirement you wish it had, which is to say it  doesn\\'t have the language that\\'s in 1028A. Your\\n \\n47  essential argument is that, read Mr. Stoler\\'s way, this  would utterly eviscerate (c)()(D)(ii), the consecutive  requirement. And I\\'m quite sympathetic to that. But  there\\'s still this question of when a statute doesn\\'t  say what you would like it to say and you\\'re reduced to  saying if you read it the other guy\\'s way, it would  eviscerate what we -- what we meant when we passed  another provision, you know, what -- what should we do  and where do you point us?</p><p> That\\'s --</p><p> And here, you\\'re just not --\\n\\n you just have not been clear enough. You were clear\\n\\n enough in 1028(a). We know what that looks like. But\\n\\n here, you just haven\\'t been clear enough to upset this\\n\\n background presumption.</p><p> Well, offense conduct, does  that mean without a gun?\\n \\n35</p><p> That\\'s --</p><p> What you think ought to  happen is that the -- is that the judge should say,  okay, imagine a robbery without a gun, what would be a  reasonable sentence for that.</p><p> But what are you suggesting  ought to happen? I mean, presumably, the guidelines  reflect an idea that there shouldn\\'t be any  double-counting of the gun, right? So what does -- how\\n \\n34  does the court do the -- the sentence on the underlying  crime, taking away the fact of the gun?  In other words, most robberies have guns in  them, and the sentences are written to reflect that they  have guns in them, don\\'t they? Aren\\'t they?</p><p> Well that\\'s where I don\\'t\\n\\n understand your -- your answer to Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n because you said, no, you\\'re not saying that 924\\n\\n supersedes 3553. I think you have to be saying that.\\n\\n You might still be right, but you have to be saying that\\n\\n there\\'s this background principle, which is 3553, which\\n\\n is this parsimony principle and all these factors, and\\n\\n then 924 comes along and says, but not here.</p><p> One way you might look at\\n\\n this, and this goes back to what the Chief Justice said,\\n\\n he said, well, when there\\'s a 30-year sentence\\n\\n implicated, you better be pretty clear. And also when\\n\\n you\\'re legislating against a fairly strong background\\n\\n principle of 3553, you better be pretty clear that\\n\\n you\\'re displacing that background principle.</p><p> Well, that\\'s --</p><p> Well, you\\'re right. The  Congress did not say you -- it did not say what it said,  in fact, in 1028A. But, you know, sometimes, sometimes  the way we try to understand statutes is to say any  reading that utterly eviscerates something that Congress  clearly did say can\\'t be a good reading.</p><p> Just assume the 1028 for a\\n\\n moment didn\\'t exist and say you had to argue from this\\n\\n language, and this essentially repeats Justice\\n\\n Ginsburg\\'s point, but this language says, \"It shall run\\n\\n consecutively, it shall not run concurrently.\" And your\\n\\n version of this statute essentially allows a district\\n\\n court to negate that language. It\\'s as if that language\\n\\n were not there in terms of what the -- the -- the\\n\\n district court can do.</p><p> But just --</p><p> Well, \"some sentence,\" you\\n\\n know, a day, six hours, whatever it is, but can\\n\\n essentially make that -- that disappear. I mean, you\\n\\n know, it\\'s concurrent plus a day. I mean, that couldn\\'t\\n\\n have been what Congress meant, concurrent plus a day,\\n\\n when it said, \"It shall only be consecutive.\"</p><p> She\\'s Justice Sotomayor.</p><p> She was the one helping you.  (Laughter.)</p><p> I was the one who wasn\\'t.  (Laughter.)</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Well, but you said you\\n\\n \\n  can't have this, but you can if we interpret the statute  the way the government wants.</p><p> Well, you couldn't under\\n\\n 1028A.</p><p> That's the question before\\n\\n us.</p><p> Well, that's -- that's --\\n\\n that's --</p><p> In first looking at this\\n\\n case, my thought was that it would be very difficult for\\n\\n the judge to determine what the sentence should be for\\n\\n the underlying crime without looking at what he was\\n\\n require -- or he or she was required to do under 924.\\n\\n But then it occurred to me that judges and lawyers do\\n\\n this all the time. We -- we think of a hypothetical\\n\\n case.\\n\\n Suppose 924 did not exist. What sentence\\n\\n would I give? Judges do this all the time in\\n\\n condemnation cases. We don't look at the value of the\\n\\n improvement. We -- we -- we can look at a problem in --\\n\\n in an abstract way. So I think nothing that prevents\\n\\n the judge from making the -- quite a proper\\n\\n determination for the underlying offense and said --\\n\\n then saying, but looking at the statute, it has to be\\n\\n consecutive and the consecutive sentence has been -- the\\n\\n length of the consecutive sentence has been set forth.\\n\\n So I -- I see nothing analytically difficult about the\\n\\n \\n\\n government's position.</p><p> And it seems to me you're  asking us to say that 924(c) really supersedes 3553.</p><p> Well, that -- that's an  excerpt from the legislative history that, it seems to  me, is unimportant in light of what 3553 says. 3553(a)  says, you know, well, that the judge at the end of the  day has to consider the need for the sentence imposed to  reflect the serious of the offense and so forth. And -</p><p> It seems to me that you  have to concede that your position completely negates  the -- or can completely negate the effect of 924, but  that there are other reasons why Congress probably would  have allowed that. And I suppose that's 3553 to take  into account all of those factors.  So you're saying, basically, that 3553  overrides 924(c), but that -- that -- that's hard to  read the statute that way.</p><p> Well, it seems to me that  you -</p><p> You're -- you're asking\\n\\n the judge to say, in calculating the sentence for the\\n\\n underlying offense, I'm going to look at all these\\n\\n factors. Frankly, it's meaningless, because what I'm\\n\\n going to do in the 924(c), but I'll do something\\n\\n meaningless.</p><p> But -- but -- but other\\n\\n than for the initial downward departure.</p><p> So you're saying that in\\n\\n this case, the judge says I can't look at 3553(a)?</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>This is the -</p><p> Isn't that your point?</p><p> Had it done so by the\\n\\n time 924(c) was amended?</p><p> A circuit court's\\n\\n ruling -- there's at least one, the Tenth, that had\\n\\n ruled in your favor.</p><p> And one day is a day of  punishment, isn't it?</p><p> So it's not negating  Congress's purpose if a district court gives one day;  correct?</p><p> Counsel, during the time  the guidelines were mandatory, but afterwards, many,  many court of appeals basically told district courts you  can't impose a sentence simply because you disagree with  the guideline. You can impose it for independent  reasons to ensure a just result, but you can't impose it  merely because you don't like the guideline. And they  monitored that pretty well.  That's basically what -- this district court  didn't say it didn't like the mandatory minimum. It  said instead that it thought a fair sentence was, and\\n \\n  that -- that would have been one day, if it could have  done it, given that the rest of the sentence, 30 years,  was even further beyond what the judge thought was  adequate for punishment, deterrence, and all the other  factors under 3553, correct?</p><p> Postdated or predated\\n\\n the changes in 924 --</p><p> -- I mean, the lack of\\n\\n beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so\\n\\n many levels; all right? What differentiates a normal\\n\\n theft from a robbery is the use of force. And the\\n\\n guidelines, in defining the guidelines range for a\\n\\n \\n41  theft, starts at a much, much lower base level. Starts  at a seven, okay? For a robbery, it starts at a base  level of .  Once you start with that huge difference  between the use of force and the nonuse of force,  obviously, the robbery guideline is always going to  include the use of force. The fact that it might be  with a gun as opposed to a knife as opposed to a threat  of violence or whatever else you want to define it, the  use of force is inherent already in the guideline  calculation because, otherwise, that -- there's no  reason. They could have just had one table and said, if  you rob someone, if it was a pure calculation, as you  suggest it, without thinking about the gun, it would  have been $,000 is taken, we're all going to start at  a offense level of five years and build up from there.  That's not what the guidelines do.  So when you're taking discretion away from a  judge, I think that's one of the reasons we often  require specificity, because the guidelines are  artificial in so many different ways. And there are  gyrations that we go through as judges to comply with  dictates that are not very often very clear.</p><p> Exactly. So the five  years is for the terrorism.</p><p> And in many ways it's  punishing for a separate activity than merely the  possession of identity theft items.</p><p> The identity theft  add-ons, one is -- for every crime except terrorism is  only two years, correct?</p><p> Now, in terms of that  analytical difficulty, there is inherent in this scheme  a bit of double -- a lot of double counting, because the  substantive crimes almost always, in trying to judge the  severity of punishment for that, you're always thinking  of the gun, and -- and that always adds to whatever  analytically separate punishment you think should be  given for the substantive crime.  So there is a little bit of twisting of a  judge by saying you have to somehow put yourself in the  position of punishing this person without knowing that  he's going to be punished for the gun anyway for 30  years, and think of what the punishment should be  without that punishment. Because the gun is present in  both crimes, correct?</p><p> So he would be 50-odd  something?</p><p> How old was your  defendant?

I  mean, it doesn\\'t say -- there is no clear language  saying laches doesn\\'t apply in this context. It gives  you a time limit. And the question whether laches is  applied is just an issue that\\'s not addressed in that  language.</p><p> And that\\'s what - that\\'s what Federico -- Federico did, right?</p><p> You don\\'t dispute  that equitable estoppel applies across the board?</p><p> We will hear  argument next in Case -927, SCA Hygiene Products  Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products.  Mr. Black.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN J. BLACK  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p><p> Well, just to stop  you there. I\\'m just reading what the -- this is in the  red brief, so you can correct it if it\\'s wrong, but he  said the commentary, his commentary explained that,\\n \\n  quote, \"unenforceability,\" end quote, was, quote, \"added  by amendment in the Senate for greater clarity, and that  as amended, the defenses would include equitable  defenses such as laches.\"  Now there are words in between the quoted  passages, so are you going to tell me those are -</p>', 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>Well, Mr. Waxman, to follow\\n\\n up on this point, Mr. Black made several -- made several\\n\\n points. One is that asserting a laches defense is\\n\\n obligatory, and therefore it leads to a lot of pointless\\n\\n litigation, according to his submission.\\n\\n And second, that the reasonable royalty is\\n\\n not such a tremendous penalty.\\n\\n So could you just respond briefly to those\\n\\n two?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>I accept that.</p><p> No. No, that isn\\'t. If it  isn\\'t -- look. If it isn\\'t unscrupulous -- if it isn\\'t  unscrupulous, laches doesn\\'t apply. If there is nothing  unjust or inequitable about it, laches doesn\\'t apply.  I am not getting into an argument about who  did or didn\\'t behave unscrupulously. I am assuming that  there was unscrupulous behavior that would ordinarily  call into play laches. I am assuming that.  For example, after telling him, don\\'t worry,  I won\\'t sue, he phoned him up every day to see if the  evidence has been burned up.</p><p> I want to -</p><p> No, you -- please.  I think that whether there is unscrupulous\\n \\n behavior or bad or unfair behavior is a function of\\n\\n\\n\\n whether an existing doctrine, laches, applies to the\\n\\n case. And that I think is the issue here.\\n\\n So I have to assume laches applies to the\\n\\n case, if laches applies at all, and that\\'s what we are\\n\\n arguing about.</p><p> No, it\\'s not. It\\'s the\\n\\n difference -- the difference that when, in fact, in an\\n\\n appropriate case, you do sue under copyright, what you\\n\\n get is the profit from the last six years, minus the\\n\\n costs to produce that profit.\\n\\n When you do sue in patent, and the examples\\n\\n are in the Dell brief, you get the profit for the last\\n\\n six years without subtracting the money that previously\\n\\n went in to produce that profit, and moreover, companies\\n\\n spend hundreds of millions of dollars in reliance on\\n\\n \\n whatever conduct gave rise to laches. That\\'s the\\n\\n\\n\\n differences.</p><p> Can I go back a step,  because you may have -- if I understand what you\\'re  saying, we have a case that would otherwise be laches.  That is, every one agrees that Smith has Jones\\' patent.  But Smith thinks that Jones has given him approval, a  license, a very complex kind, and so he goes ahead and  uses it. Jones sells to a -- let\\'s use a phrase that\\'s  not happy, but \"patent troll.\"  The patent troll gets the patent. The\\n \\n patent troll looks at the license. The patent troll\\n\\n\\n\\n says, I don\\'t think this really works, the license. I\\'m\\n\\n going to bring a lawsuit.\\n\\n He brings a lawsuit. The judge thinks this\\n\\n is very unfair, given what the patent troll and everyone\\n\\n else had told the defendant. Laches would normally\\n\\n apply.\\n\\n And I was saying now they\\'re going to get\\n\\n vast profit without the expense that went into making\\n\\n the profit. You say I\\'m wrong. The reason I\\'m wrong is\\n\\n because you only get a reasonable royalty. And in\\n\\n calculating the reasonable royalty, the judge will\\n\\n subtract the costs of producing that royalty during the\\n\\n six-year period, so you\\'ll end up where you end up in\\n\\n copyright.\\n\\n Now, do I have the argument correctly?</p><p> No, I was thinking of the\\n\\n examples in the Dell brief, which undoubtedly you\\'ve\\n\\n read.</p><p> Those are the examples in\\n\\n my mind.</p><p> A weak point in your  argument is all -- most of those prior cases were - were equity cases, but the weak point\\'s weakened because  most of those equity cases after 1897 were under  provisions that had a statute of limitations, and the  reason you didn\\'t have laches in equity is because it  didn\\'t have a statute of limitations. But here you did  have a statute of limitations.  So you have all those cases; that\\'s your  argument. And I\\'m -- I\\'m actually just trying to  summarize it so you\\'ll tell me where it\\'s not correct.</p><p> Okay. Strengthen it, but\\n \\n40  when you strengthen it, will you please spend about a  minute or two on what I thought was another argument,  which now has been seriously undercut, and I want to be  sure you have a chance to address it.</p><p> I was -- I was afraid of - and I think I might have been well wrong to be afraid of  it -- but moved in part by the Dell brief, I was afraid  that a person with a patent or the transferee of that  patent, in year , would have told the -- a licensee, go  right ahead, go ahead, or not said anything when he  could have or something like that, that would have given  rise to laches. That licensee would have spent billions  on technology that is very hard to change.</p><p> And then in year , this  person, now the transferee of the patent, sues him, and  he is going to get six years worth of profits and  nothing deducted. Now they have told me that\\'s totally  wrong because what you would have done is gone back to  year two, figured out a reasonable rate of return, and  that\\'s what it would have gotten.  I\\'m still a little worried that he brings  the same lawsuit in  -- year , year , years  thereafter, and thereby really fixes this guy who has,\\n \\n in fact, invested $ billion on the old technology.\\n\\n41</p><p> But I want to give you a\\n\\n chance.</p><p> The part -- the part I\\'m\\n\\n missing in your argument, I\\'ve focused it -- look. Year\\n\\n , okay? It all turns on a license. License. Year .\\n\\n Gone. Disappeared. Far. Can\\'t find any witnesses,\\n\\n okay? So therefore, laches, if laches exists.\\n\\n Now, you say, the difference with copyright\\n\\n is that the people there involved are really locked in,\\n\\n that -- those are your words, \"locked in.\" I want to\\n\\n say respect, locked in. So what? Why does that make a\\n\\n difference?</p><p> \"Locked in\" means you can\\'t\\n\\n change. Why is it relevant that you can\\'t change?</p><p> I have one question on  that. I dissented in Petrella, and I thought to myself,  I lost. Okay? I lost that case. How right I was, but  nonetheless.  So I don\\'t want, I think in this case, just  to repeat, I\\'m still dissenting, so I\\'ll take Petrella  as the law, at least I\\'m tentatively doing that. And  then I looked here to say, well, is there a significant  difference? And I found so far you\\'ve mentioned them.  Maybe case law and history, but I have to  look that one up. Maybe language, but there are two  sides to that too.  Then I found this. That in Petrella, to me  in dissent a major point, which was well-answered by the  majority, is what\\'s going to happen after about 30 years  where the plaintiff has just laid in wait to see if the  material is a success, after they spend all the money  it\\'s a success, and he sues for the last six years and  collects all the profit while the defendant was the one  who paid all the money that earned the profit.  Never fear, said the majority, because you\\n \\n  can deduct all that expense from the six years\\' profit  that you\\'re suing for. Never fear. And I didn\\'t really  overcome that argument very well.  But in this case, it isn\\'t true that you can  deduct, and therefore plaintiffs can lie in wait to see,  and it is 40 times more difficult for a company that has  relied on their not suing to change the hundreds of  billions of dollars in investment, and in case we think  that\\'s theoretical, Dell has filed a brief involving  Sprint, Lucent and other companies where they spent  close to billions knowing there was somebody out there  who might sue, but he wasn\\'t going to. He led them to  believe he wasn\\'t, approximately. And then later on  they come back and they try to get all this money, just  the profit, without the deduction of the loss when it\\'s  too late for the company to change.  Now, I\\'ll look into that, but that, in my  mind, is a big difference.</p><p> -- \"unenforceable.\" And\\n\\n that could apply just to the -- the -- you know,\\n\\n monkeying around with the patent, doing bad things to\\n\\n the patent, or it could include laches. And the guy who\\n\\n writes it says, yeah, it includes laches. And you could\\n\\n read it the other way not to. So I didn\\'t get too far\\n\\n \\n with the statute, either.</p><p> In the statute is the word\\n\\n \"enforcement.\" And -- and when it is invalid, what\\'s\\n\\n the word --</p><p> Is that right? I mean,\\n\\n that\\'s how I\\'m approaching it, and I\\'m asking you to\\n\\n comment on that because I don\\'t want to waste a lot of\\n\\n time reading cases I don\\'t have to read.</p><p> For this -- for this  argument I\\'m not sure, because of course they dispute  that, and they have a long list of cases, Alsterbach - or what, Aukerman and so forth, going back into history.  And they have the man who wrote the statute, and they  have words in the statute. And they say if we look  through all of those cases, what we will find is that  there is a long history of applying laches in one legal  context, or that it\\'s -- that it\\'s patents. And anyway,  almost all patent cases were equitable cases, and so it  would be a big change, and you know all those arguments.  Now you\\'ve come back and you have two  arguments -- two cases the other way, and you say two  are mistaken. So it seems to me what I have to do on  that one is read the cases. And if I come to the\\n \\n conclusion that there is this long history here, then\\n\\n\\n\\n the laches should stay. And if I come to the conclusion\\n\\n that no, if you really look at these cases, there isn\\'t\\n\\n that history, then it should go. But neither is it a\\n\\n case, one way or the other, of us making up anything.\\n\\n It\\'s a question of what was the heart of the law for\\n\\n quite a long time before.</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>May -- may I just  clarify?  Petrella explained, in the context of that  case, that it wasn\\'t unscrupulous for this woman to wait\\n \\n  to see whether there was anything in it for her. Why  should she spend her money on a lawsuit when there  wasn\\'t anything in the bank?  So the -- the point was that it wasn\\'t  unscrupulous to wait to see whether the suit was worth  the expense of suing. That was -</p><p> Wait, wait. This is --\\n\\n this is still an issue in this case. There is an issue\\n\\n whether estoppel would apply.</p><p> Where is the\\n\\n \\n  codification? I don\\'t see anything in that -- what is  it?  -- 282? -- other than the word \"enforceable.\"</p><p> Well, how could it be  when it doesn\\'t make the patent unenforceable?</p><p> I don\\'t know -- I don\\'t  know if all would concede that. I think we were just  told that unenforceability relates to things that would  bar you from ever enforcing the patent, like patent  misuse or misrepresentation to the patent office.</p><p> I do -- I do understand\\n\\n you mentioned the issue preclusion in -- in\\n\\n Blonder-Tongue is such a case. So what -- what is there\\n\\n about issue preclusion that was different than --</p><p> Some of them -- some of\\n\\n them, misuse would go across the board -- board. But\\n\\n you can have an estoppel as to one alleged infringer,\\n\\n and not have it to another.</p><p> So I don\\'t see how -- how\\n\\n issue preclusion would then work.</p><p> Maybe they were -- they  were looking at what the statute of limitations -- what  the -- the origin was that equity invented laches  because there was no statute of limitation. And so\\n \\n31  there was a gap to fill on the equity side. On the law  side, you had a statute of limitations. And we are  told, and I think it\\'s right, that this Court has said  that when you\\'re seeking damages at law and there is a  statute of limitations, the statute of limitations is  what Congress ordered, not laches. It\\'s just like it  was in the old days, when you went into a law court for  damages, you had a statute of limitations, and that was  what applied, and not an extra delay -- not an extra  doctrine.</p><p> Does it support a time  limitation?</p><p> In support -- sorry.</p><p> The question is not - the question is not whether laches was available. The  question is whether it was available in face of a time  limitation set by Congress. And frankly, I don\\'t see a  big difference between the way the patent statute of  limitations work than the way the copyright statute did  in Petrella.</p><p> What about the  well-established understanding that laches cannot bar  claims for the legal relief that have their own time  limitation?</p><p> Did the senator that you\\n\\n just quoted, did he use unenforceability the -- the way\\n\\n you do?</p><p> There is a whole series\\n\\n of decisions in the courts of appeal. On the legal\\n\\n question it turns on the interpretation of a statutory\\n\\n text.\\n\\n This Court has never ruled on it. Is the\\n\\n Court estopped because there have been a number of\\n\\n courts of appeals who have ruled one way? This Court\\n\\n has never addressed the question.</p><p> The Federal Circuit - the Federal Circuit was the final word until this Court  stepped in.</p><p> And the Federal Circuit\\'s  position was clear.</p><p> What does the judge\\n\\n usually charge -- now in many of these cases, at least\\n\\n one of the briefs said, are tried to a jury. What does\\n\\n the judge instruct the jury about the monetary recovery\\n\\n in a patent suit?</p><p> How much do you have to\\n\\n pay? You have -- it\\'s only six years. And if what you\\n\\n have to pay is a reasonable royalty, that doesn\\'t sound\\n\\n so horrendous, does it? And it sounds like just what\\n\\n Congress meant when it gave you a six-year statute of\\n\\n limitations.</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>But speaking of the general  maxim, Mr. Waxman, wouldn't we expect that if Congress  wanted to make an exception for patent law or wanted to\\n \\n continue exception that existed as a result of the\\n\\n36\\n\\n preexisting practice, that Congress actually would have\\n\\n said so?</p><p> Well, Mr. Black, I take it  that Mr. Waxman's principal point is that what separates  out the patent context is that laches was operating true  in equity but with a statute of limitations, and that  that just wasn't true in other places.

In other words, if we have - if the chauffeur who drives the -- the kingpin around  and therefore is going to be a co -- a co-conspirator.

That was the point of the in rem proceeding, wasn\\'t\\n\\n it?</p><p> Co-conspirators came and\\n\\n you say let\\'s look to the common law and the common law\\n\\n made that argument impossible because if you look to the\\n\\n history of it as I said you had to have the property\\n\\n itself in an in rem proceeding, so that\\'s why I asked\\n\\n the question.</p><p> Here the person didn\\'t\\n\\n obtain it in any odd common English thing until you\\'re\\n\\n saying -- that word \"obtained\" means is property he\\n\\n didn\\'t obtain.</p><p> And it doesn\\'t say in A1  that a person who doesn\\'t have the tainted property is  liable in an equivalent amount. It doesn\\'t say in (p)  that outside those circumstances the person is liable  for an equivalent amount. It doesn\\'t say in common law  where you had to proceed against in rem the property,  and there was no way to get the money from a person who  didn\\'t actually have it because you had to have the  property itself in the proceeding. So there\\'s no common  law source. It doesn\\'t say it in P. It doesn\\'t say it  in A, and indeed congress, said when they passed this  that these are exhaustive, we want -- we\\'re not adding\\n \\n\\n to anything, we\\'re trying to make it exhaustive. So\\n\\n\\n\\n just where in the statute does it give you the authority\\n\\n to draw the conclusion that you\\'re drawing?</p><p> Okay. And so the defendant  is liable for the tainted property. And then (p) gives  him circumstances where he\\'s liable for other than the  tainted property. All right.</p><p> Where does it say that? I  mean -- I didn\\'t take that point -- you\\'re saying the  word \"property\" in A1 is the tainted property.</p><p> Where -</p><p> And you\\'re able to do that  under what statute? You see, everything until you said  ah, you see the last clauses here, I could follow in a\\n \\n42  statute. A statute that Congress said this is pretty  exclusive.  Now -</p><p> -- of the forfeiture, it\\'s  quite different from that. The history of the  forfeiture was you had to have the property itself and  certainly if we\\'re looking to history and tradition,  history and tradition are the one thing when you\\'re  talking about criminal liability and it seems to me,  which is why I asked, quite the opposite.

I\\'m curious about\\n\\n that, but first let\\'s talk about (b) -- (p).</p><p> If they -- if you could go\\n\\n after Conspirator A, you could find it, he just put it\\n\\n in a bank account, but that\\'s irrelevant.</p><p> So really you\\'re only saying\\n\\n it has to be unavailable as to Conspirator B.

Then as to\\n\\n B, who you do have in front of you, you started by\\n\\n talking a little bit about this -- this (p) section.

I\\n\\n\\n\\n understand that that is an error, and I -- the argument,\\n\\n of course, that it is a structural error; but I'm just\\n\\n quarreling with the idea that these are the most\\n\\n grievous miscarriages of -- of justice you can imagine.\\n\\n There are particular characteristics of them\\n\\n that put them in a different category. The -- the --</p><p> Is the difficulty in  any particular case something that can be weighed in  determining whether the defendant has carried his burden  of showing prejudice?  I mean, in some of these, you say -- I guess  we haven't required in some Batson cases, I think it  would be -- that's where I do think it would be almost  impossible to put the burden on showing prejudice. On  the other hand, denial of counsel of choice, I would\\n \\n51  think that would be pretty easy to show whether there's  prejudice or -- or not, right?  Is that something a judge, reviewing whether  there's been an adequate showing of prejudice, can take  into account, or is it all or nothing?</p><p> A list of errors\\n\\n that could occur in criminal procedure, I think you'd\\n\\n agree, there's some that you would put ahead of\\n\\n excluding members of the public from voir dire when the\\n\\n courtroom is otherwise full.</p><p> Thank you,\\n\\n Ms. O'Connell.\\n\\n Mr. Kimberly.\\n\\n REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> The -- the\\n\\n structural errors are not the most grievous errors\\n\\n possible in the criminal process. They are a particular\\n\\n type of error, which the assumption is there's no way to\\n\\n tell whether they're prejudicial or not. But, I mean,\\n\\n this -- this may be a good case. That doesn't mean\\n\\n they're the most shocking miscarriages of justice you\\n\\n can imagine.</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>In -- in this case, what's  your best theory about how this could have affected the  trial? What happened here?</p><p> So in this -</p><p> Well, suppose the two people  who couldn't get in were members of the public, but not  the defendant's mother and her pastor.</p><p> As a practical matter, it's  never possible to show that it -- there -- it would - there would be no outcome -- no effect on the outcome?</p><p> Well, that's a different --\\n\\n I mean, that's a different situation. Suppose the only\\n\\n people who wanted to go -- the only members of the\\n\\n public who wanted to be in this -- in the courtroom were\\n\\n the family and the friends of the victims of a crime.\\n\\n So it would be a hostile audience.</p><p> Unless it's a -- unless the\\n\\n fact that it's a structural error is fatal, then in the\\n\\n situation -- in -- in the hypothetical Justice Ginsburg\\n\\n provided, wouldn't it be open to you to prove that it\\n\\n was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt?</p><p> As a practical matter -</p><p> So what -- what you're  saying, and I -- I think this is true -- is that there  are circumstances in which closing the courtroom can  have an effect on the outcome of the -- of the trial.  But, conversely, is it your position that  it's never possible for there to be a violation of the  right without there being an effect on the trial; that  it's never possible to show that this could not have had  any effect on the outcome?</p><p> Well, it's not a question of  putting two wrongs together. I mean, the Commonwealth's  argument and the argument of the United States is that  there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment right to\\n \\n  counsel unless the -- the counsel's performance deprived  the defendant of a -- a fair trial. It's -- this is not  a Sixth Amendment speedy trial -- I'm sorry - public-trial act issue. It's a right-to-counsel issue.  And prejudice is built into the Sixth Amendment  Strickland standard because the defendant had an  attorney.  So on what theory was the defendant deprived  of an attorney? Well, the theory is, although there was  somebody sitting next to that defendant and asking  questions and pretending to be an attorney, that  attorney was so bad that he might as well not have had  an attorney. So it's built right in. And so,  ultimately, there has to be the determination for there  to be a Sixth Amendment right-to-trial violation that  there was prejudice.  Now, you can make the argument that it's  impossible to tell whether there was prejudice, but it's  built right into the speedy -- into the -- a right to  counsel.</p><p> And -- and you have to say\\n\\n that that's always true, or it's -- it's true in such a\\n\\n high percentage of the cases that there's no point in\\n\\n even making that an issue, no matter how steep the\\n\\n burden that the prosecution might have to satisfy.</p><p> Let's put this label aside  for a minute. You really think that it's impossible,  that there can never be a case where a violation like  the one that took place here had no effect on the  outcome of the trial?</p><p> It's impossible to ever - for there ever to be such a case -</p><p> And there is no violation of  the right to counsel based purely on deficient  performance; isn't that right?</p><p> So there has to be -- the\\n\\n prejudice prong has to be satisfied.</p><p> Okay. It was probably not  very clear.  The error -- what we are being asked to  address is the right to counsel; am I right?</p><p> -- of the right to trial - the right to counsel.</p><p> No. But that's not the  error that's -- that is before us. The error -- the  alleged error that's before us is a violation -</p><p> Is there a distinction\\n\\n \\n45  between the -- the examples that you gave where -- where  it would appear that the issue would be a question of  harmless error, and the situation here, where the  question is whether there's a constitutional error at  all?</p><p> So your -- your examples\\n\\n were ineffective assistance of counsel cases, not just\\n\\n Batson cases.</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>That would be an awful lot  of -- that -- that's exactly what's worrying me. Batson  errors, you know, we can think of a host. Sir Walter  Raleigh is in the Star Chamber. You know, I mean,  you -- now, the government's position is what? The  government's position is that even though there is a  serious structural error, really serious, the all-white  jury, the Star Chamber, et cetera, even then -- and the  lawyer didn't object -- even then, the person doesn't  automatically get a new trial.  The truth of the matter is, we don't know\\n \\n\\n what would have happened in the jury room. We can't\\n\\n44\\n\\n say. And if what we're supposed to do is weigh the\\n\\n evidence, I guess then you're having trial by appellate\\n\\n judge. And -- and so do -- do we get into that? Is\\n\\n that what you want, that in each case, no matter how\\n\\n egregious sort of the structural error, which may or may\\n\\n not affect the jury -- we don't know -- that there's no\\n\\n new trial? The appellate judges are supposed to say\\n\\n whether or not there really would have been or likely\\n\\n would have been an impact on this case?\\n\\n That strikes me as a little -- I mean, I\\n\\n would like to hear your answer, because it strikes me\\n\\n as -- as not -- not -- yeah.</p><p> Okay. Now, but they - they want -- and they want to go to the other extreme,  basically. But if we're cutting this child in two, what  about that as a standard?</p><p> But you're asking us --\\n\\n you say, no, none. Just take structural error as your\\n\\n category, and -- and period, and that's it.</p><p> No, that's true.</p><p> What do you think about\\n\\n that?</p><p> What about using it -- if\\n\\n we're going to distinguish among substantial -- among\\n\\n structural errors, taking the standard out of Allano and\\n\\n saying those that seriously affect the fairness,\\n\\n integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\\n\\n if the -- if the procedural -- if the structural error\\n\\n rises to meet that standard, then -- then you don't have\\n\\n to show prejudice. But if it doesn't, then you'd\\n\\n better. Now, that would harmonize the plain error and\\n\\n this proceeding which can come up in the -- in a\\n\\n collateral proceeding.</p><p> Yes, but what -- what's\\n\\n your line?</p><p> I mean, do you -- suppose\\n\\n that the structural error were excluding\\n\\n \\n30  African-Americans from the jury, or women from the jury.  Okay? That's the error. They select a different jury.  All white men. Now, we have no way of knowing whether  that made a real difference in that case. We don't  know. So it's a structural error.  Now, are you saying in such a circumstance,  where the lawyer failed to object, et cetera, therefore  Strickland, therefore inadequate assistance of counsel,  that that isn't the end of it? That there was an all  white male jury? Isn't that the end of it, even though  we don't know if there was prejudice in the sense that  the jury would have decided differently? Is that your  position?</p><p> I'm asking my question.  And my question, I thought, until I'm getting this  answer, that, of course, in some instances, you say it  was such an unfair trial, and you show inadequate  assistance of counsel and that's the end of it. You  presume the prejudice. And I was going to ask you how  you draw the line.</p><p> I'm not interested in  Strickland at the moment. I want to know how you think,  in this case, we should draw the line between those  structural errors, which are absolutely egregious, and\\n \\n32  it is plain that the defendant did not get a fair trial,  although we cannot prove one way or the other that it  would have made a difference to the outcome.</p><p> I -- I would have thought  that you would have said, of course, in such a case,  inadequate assistance of counsel for not raising that  error leads to a new trial. We presume prejudice. And  if you're not going to say that, then I will withdraw  all my questions and keep quiet.  (Laughter.)</p><p> You can't. All right? You  can't. You can't prove that the jury would have come  out differently.  So I'd say, at least in my mind, if your  point is that even -- suppose they had a -- a trial by  inquisition. I mean, you know, I can imagine even the  most fantastic examples where you don't know whether,  really, the result would have been every -- different if  you had the most perfect jury. All right?  Now, you're saying either there -- the --\\n \\n31  somebody has to prove that it really made a difference?  That's what a structural error is really about, that  kind of case, where you can't prove it because it was a  basically unfair proceeding.</p><p> I -- I don't care what the  Court said.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>The problem is the\\n\\n structural errors -- I think one brings -- put it this\\n\\n way -- come in all sizes and shapes. So here we have\\n\\n not -- not an exclusion of public from the trial itself.\\n\\n It's only the from the jury selection.\\n\\n But I take it your view is it doesn't\\n\\n matter. If it had been the first day of the jury\\n\\n selection, everything else is open, or if the entire\\n\\n proceedings were closed. Structural error -- you go\\n\\n from structural error directly to new trial.\\n\\n Do you make any distinctions between kinds\\n\\n of errors that we have called structural?</p><p> It didn't -- didn't get  involved with the structural. It was -- that was a per  curiam opinion. And it was -- and just the question  was, does it -- does it violate the public-trial right?  Yes. But Presley doesn't go on to say what the remedy  should be when that's not brought up by counsel, and  your own -</p><p> Supposing this objection  had been made at the first opportunity and it's denied  by the trial judge. And then it goes up on appeal. So  there was a timely objection. Wouldn't it follow, then,  that the case has to be -- the judgment has to be  vacated and there has to be a retrial?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': \"<p>Work with -- work with\\n\\n the usual, the Federal jurisdiction, which is\\n\\n predominant in most States, which is that IECs are done\\n\\n collaterally.</p><p> I -- I understand that,\\n\\n but, please, just -- just stick with me.</p><p> It's still a prong ,\\n\\n \\n\\n though, right?</p><p> Thank you.</p><p> Defense counsel just\\n\\n doesn't bring it -- doesn't bring it on direct appeal.\\n\\n Good defence counsel wouldn't bring it, and would leave\\n\\n it for collateral review in most jurisdictions.</p><p> Right.</p><p> But that's the third  prong. You're not answering Justice Breyer's question,  with respect. That gets you past the third prong, but  it doesn't get you home in an unpreserved error case.  You still have to meet the fourth prong.</p><p> Well, why doesn't that  follow, though? Because it seems to me that if it's  unpreserved error at trial and we get to appeal, you - you have a choice. In most cases, I see claims are\\n \\n  dealt with collaterally. You could either bring it as a  plain error of question on direct appeal, but you have  to face prong  -</p><p> Well, work with me with\\n\\n the typical jurisdiction. I know Massachusetts is a\\n\\n little different.</p><p> -- and show it affects the  integrity of the proceedings, or you have a choice. You  could bring it in collateral proceedings where you  wouldn't have to meet prong , and it would actually be  easier to win a Sixth Amendment collateral claim than it  would be a plain error claim. And it -- it just seems  very unusual to me that we create a structure that would  incentivize, through honest and good advocacy, defines  the -- the normality of the final judgments. So that's  question one.  And question two is related. Would we then  create actually a really perverse incentive for the  State to secure IEC waivers from individuals so that  they don't confront these kinds of problems, and  therefore, kind of a Professor Stunt sort of problem, by  perfecting procedure, we actually result in its denial  at all.  Can you help me with those two problems?</p><p> Doesn't that seem highly  unlikely? I mean, a structural error, we think is  important, but it isn't automatically a winner every  single time if you don't preserve it.</p><p> What about -- what about  counsel's argument we just heard a moment ago, that  there's a triviality exception. Might this case qualify  for that?</p><p> I understand. But why  should we assume there was one here? Why wasn't -</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>I -- I just -- I\\'m sorry to  keep, like, bugging you about this, but it just seems so  Kafkaesque to me. It\\'s like you have to prove  something, but we know you can\\'t prove it.</p><p> But we\\'ve said it. We\\'ve  said it a hundred times.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Well, it\\'s not meant to be\\n\\n easy, but it\\'s meant to be possible. And what we\\'ve\\n\\n said in our structural error cases is that it\\'s not\\n\\n possible in a very, very large proportion of them.</p><p> Mr. -- Mr. Ravitz, I don\\'t\\n\\n know, maybe this is a simple-minded way to look at\\n\\n things, but I\\'ve always thought Strickland, it\\'s about\\n\\n the fairness and the reliability of the trial process.\\n\\n And that\\'s a pretty important thing to be concerned\\n\\n about. And we have said as part of Strickland that you\\n\\n \\n\\n have to show prejudice, because we\\'re not really\\n\\n36\\n\\n concerned about lawyers, however bad they may be, who do\\n\\n things that just don\\'t affect the reliability of the\\n\\n trial.\\n\\n But here, with respect to these structural\\n\\n errors, what we\\'ve said again and again and again is we\\n\\n actually just don\\'t know. So the -- in any particular\\n\\n case, whether the commission of this error affected the\\n\\n outcome.\\n\\n So what you are suggesting to us is that the\\n\\n defendant has to come in and prove as part of\\n\\n Strickland -- which, as I said, is integral to ensuring\\n\\n the fairness and reliability of the process -- has to\\n\\n come in and prove as part of that something that we have\\n\\n said, time and again, is unprovable. And that just\\n\\n seems like that\\'s not something that a legal system\\n\\n should do. You have to prove something that we\\'ve\\n\\n admitted is unprovable.</p><p> Well, but then what you\\'re  asking us to do is you\\'re asking us to apply Strickland  in such a way that we\\'re saying this terrible attorney  error took place because we\\'re assuming that. And we  think it might -- it could have affected the outcome of  the trial, but because of the kind of error it is, as  we\\'ve said a hundred times, we just are not able to - to say that with any certainty, so we\\'ll give the  benefit of the doubt to the government.</p><p> You know, I\\'m not saying  that there aren\\'t cases where you can have a sort of gut  intuition as to whether it did or not. But one of the  things that have made us put these particular rights in  this box called \"structural\" is that we say, you know,  notwithstanding that you can pick out a case here and  there and say, okay. I kind of know.  In general, these are -- it is so  speculative as to whether this fundamental defect in the  trial process caused error that we\\'re going to -- to - to presume it.</p><p> But that\\'s the underlying\\n\\n violation of the ineffective assistance claim.</p><p> Even though we\\'ve said over\\n\\n and over that you can\\'t prove prejudice.\\n\\n \\n47</p><p> I don\\'t think we\\'ve ever\\n\\n really talked about burdens when we label things\\n\\n structural errors. You know, we don\\'t say, oh, you\\n\\n \\n\\n haven\\'t met your burden. I mean, what we\\'ve said is\\n\\n49\\n\\n that the whole burden analysis kind of goes out the\\n\\n window because this is so hard to prove because it\\'s so\\n\\n speculative.\\n\\n So it\\'s really not a question of who has the\\n\\n burden. It\\'s just never been the way we\\'ve addressed\\n\\n the structural error category.</p><p> And you would say the same\\n\\n rule would go, and you have to prove prejudice.</p><p> But I thought your\\n\\n understanding of Batson was that you were saying when an\\n\\n attorney is deficient, as respects to a Batson claim,\\n\\n there, too, you would say that -- sort of too bad.</p><p> But, in a way, Mr. Kimberly,\\n\\n I mean, you don\\'t have to convince us of that, do you?</p><p> So whether they\\'re  important, whether they\\'re not important, whether  they\\'re critical to fundamental fairness or not, you  know, is, in some ways, beside the point.</p><p> And -- and that\\'s really  what\\'s at issue here, is whether we should put the  defendant to the burden of showing how it affected the  trial, when, in fact, we\\'ve said over and over that you  can\\'t do that.</p><p> Yeah. No. I\\'m saying you\\n\\n don\\'t have to convince us, because -- because one of the\\n\\n \\n  things that we\\'ve said over and over about structural  error is that it\\'s -- it\\'s impossible to show how they  affected the trial.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>And what's -- and what --\\n\\n is there a structural error in this case, in your view,\\n\\n under the hypothetical?</p><p> And under Justice\\n\\n \\n\\n Ginsburg's hypothetical, there's an objection, the\\n\\n\\n\\n objection is overruled, it's wrongly overruled. And\\n\\n then you say, well, in Massachusetts, we would -- there\\n\\n would be a reversal.\\n\\n What about under the law of the\\n\\n Constitution? Must there be a reversal on the facts of\\n\\n that hypothetical?</p><p> How -- how about here?  And we get into the whole problem with speedy trial,  they close it -- pardon me -- lack of public trial.  They close it for an hour, they close for half a day,  they close it for a day, they close it for two days,  they close it for the voir dire.  How -- how do we go about looking at that?\\n \\n\\n Is -- is that presented in this case?\\n\\n52</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>The defendant doesn't  know enough to object. But here there are serious  questions about waiver and forfeiture. It's -- why  wouldn't it be in the best interest of every attorney to  say, I didn't know that a closure was a constitutional  violation, the way this gentleman did? Isn't that -</p><p> No. In every  circumstance.</p><p> In -- in virtually every  circumstance, the lawyer knows there's been a closure.  There's been plain error in his failure -- his or her  failure to object. So how does the judge determine  whether that waiver or forfeiture should or should not  be held against the defendant?</p><p> Could -- could I ask  you, though, there is a big difference between the  absence of an attorney at trial or a conflict of  interest. In both those situations, there's not a  possibility of waiver or forfeiture -- the -- knowing\\n \\n  waiver or forfeiture because a conflicted counsel has  failed to tell someone a truth that they're conflicted  and gotten themselves off the case. Absence of counsel  is the very essence of the violation.</p><p> I think reverse is true  of our case law.</p><p> Oh, that's not the - the lessons of our case law.</p><p> -- so that they could\\n\\n measure the possible effects or not, and end up saying\\n\\n that the substantial integrity of the proceedings\\n\\n haven't been violated?\\n\\n Do you think that, as a matter of law, we\\n\\n \\n  could overrule a finding of that nature, if it was in  direct review under plain error?</p><p> It's available. The\\n\\n question is, wouldn't the judge be doing exactly what's\\n\\n happening here? Wouldn't the judge, under the fourth\\n\\n prong, look at what actually happens, whether the\\n\\n closure was complete, part of the trial, was there a\\n\\n transcript of the voir dire --</p><p> What's wrong -- wouldn't\\n\\n it be logical to say that there are -- that structural\\n\\n errors on the reliability of a trial are affected by the\\n\\n \\n34  quality of the violation? A partial closure, improper  as it may be, is not the same as a total closure. And  in a total situation, the reliability of the trial is  put into question in a such a fundamental way that  prejudice can be presumed.  Otherwise, we're never going to make any  meaning of structural error.</p><p> So the rule that you're\\n\\n asking us to adopt today, Cronic said an absolute\\n\\n absence of counsel, you presume prejudice. We have\\n\\n further said that a conflict of interest, actual\\n\\n conflict of interest, you can presume prejudice.\\n\\n Would an absolute closure, improper closure\\n\\n of a courtroom for no reason, could we presume prejudice\\n\\n there, or would you require the proof of actual\\n\\n prejudice the way you're advocating here?</p><p> All right.</p><p> All right. So I think  what Presley said, if I'm not mistaken, is that you  can't keep out interested people just because of  overcrowding.</p><p> And so I think they have  stopped being a member of the public as might be\\n \\n  understood with respect to access. I think one thinks  of members of the public as anyone who might be  interested, but not compelled to be in attendance.</p><p> Presumably, lawyers are  members of the public. The judge is a member of the  public. The bailiff is a member of the public. I'm  presuming that once those jury members -- if they were  given a choice, would not be there.

If you take  the position that refusing to -- not answering about the  speeding ticket or the nickname is enough to subject  that person to denaturalization, the government will  have the opportunity to denaturalize anyone they want,  because everybody is going to have a situation where  they didn\\'t put in something like that -- or at least  most people.

And in a way, it seemed to me that what was being\\n\\n debated in the district court was the wrong issue about\\n\\n whether to charge the jury on materiality, because\\n\\n materiality is not in this statute. But as you have\\n\\n refined the argument, the issue is the meaning of the\\n\\n term \"procure\" --</p><p> -- which may or may not mean\\n\\n exactly the same thing as \"materiality.\"</p><p> Within your brief, you, I --\\n\\n I think, have possibly tried to read more into \"procure\"\\n\\n \\n  than you can, because in a number of spots you seem - you argued that it means \"but for causation.\" Now, this  morning you have said that\\'s not your argument. It\\'s  not -- you don\\'t have to prove that, but for the -- the  false statement in the immigration proceeding, the  person would not have been naturalized.</p><p> Well, I -- I don\\'t know  whether you can get that out of \"procured.\" Let me give  you this example. Let\\'s say there is a -- a municipal  ordinance that says that it is illegal to buy or sell a  scalp\\'s ticket within 200 feet of the entrance of a  stadium or a concert hall, and I buy -- knowingly buy a  scalped ticket within 199 feet of the entrance of this  facility.  Now, in order for me to have procured that\\n \\n  ticket contrary to law, would it be necessary to prove  that I couldn\\'t have purchased this from another scalper  around the other side who was outside of the 200 feet,  or I couldn\\'t have gotten a ticket if I had waited in  line at the box office?</p><p> This is -- yes.</p><p> Well, if -- I mean, if - this isn\\'t the issue that we -- that we took cert to  decide, but it does raise the question whether there\\'s  really anything at stake here. I assume that every Serb  in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not entitled to asylum in the  United States.</p><p> Where? In -- in Bosnia?</p><p> I -- I understand that.

That\\'s a lot of linguistic  somersaults to add to a -- a statute, isn\\'t it?</p><p> You have to do something  different; right?</p><p> Well, if that\\'s the case,  how do we distinguish between 1425(a) and (b)? (a) says  that it has to be a procured contrary to law; (b) says,  you know, procured when it\\'s not -- when you\\'re not  entitled to it.

What\\'s  the difference between (a) and (b) on the government\\'s  account? (a) says you -- you procure contrary to law,  naturalization; (b) says you procure naturalization  you\\'re not entitled to.</p><p> So it seems like,\\n\\n linguistically, we have to do some somersaults to get\\n\\n where you want to go, because no one would say that to\\n\\n violate 1425, you have to prove, say, a material\\n\\n genocide, right?</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Yeah -- please, finish.</p><p> Can I ask you, Mr. Landau -</p><p> -- about a -- a different  interpretation of the statute. Neither you nor the  government supports it, but it\\'s raised briefly in the  government\\'s -- in footnote  of the government\\'s brief,  which is this idea that what we really should be doing  here is we should be interpreting 1425 in exactly the  same way that we interpret the civil statute, 1451,  which talks about illegally procuring something.</p><p> And that both are limited to  failures to satisfy the prerequisites to naturalization.  And that\\'s really what we should be thinking about when  we interpret that.</p><p> And that would, in this  case, presumably, be because of bad character; is that  right?</p><p> Yes. And I guess what I\\'m  saying is that, how do you use that phrase in a statute  and not mean that there has to be a relationship between  the illegal acts and the procurement of naturalization?</p><p> Is -- is that the false  statement for the purpose of obtaining an immigration  benefit?</p><p> Okay.\\n \\n51</p><p> But it has -- but it has no  effect on the decision to naturalize.</p><p> So the idea that procuring  naturalization illegally somehow includes illegal acts  that have no effect on naturalization, or on procuring  naturalization, it\\'s -- it\\'s just not how we use  language.  How could it be that that is true?</p><p> Procure contrary to law and  naturalization, it\\'s procure naturalization -</p><p> Well, Mr. Parker, let me - let me try this another way. If you take this phrase,  which is a kind of a stilted phrase, because the  \"contrary to law\" comes in between. But -- but it --\\n \\n46  all it really means is procure naturalization illegally.  Do you agree with that?</p><p> Mr. Parker?</p><p> Okay. But isn\\'t -</p><p> Whatever laws it is, whether  it\\'s all laws or whether it\\'s laws relating to the  naturalization process.</p><p> But it doesn\\'t say the  statute. It just says contrary to law. It doesn\\'t say  what laws. It doesn\\'t say laws governing the  naturalization process. So that\\'s -- that\\'s one issue.  But -- but that\\'s a different issue from the  one I\\'m talking about.</p><p> Well, number one, where is  that in the statute?</p><p> -- if that\\'s not what you  meant to say in this brief, although it suggests - it -- it -- I think it is what you say, but if it\\'s not  what you meant to say, well, how could it be anything  else?\\n \\n39</p><p> And I guess if that\\'s not  what you meant to say -- and I don\\'t mean to trick you  here -</p><p> You procure  naturalization -- this is, again, on page  -- a person  who knowingly procures naturalization in an unlawful  manner, and then you clarify that that means by  violating the laws Congress has enacted. So when you  say that you procure naturalization by violating laws  Congress has enacted, all you\\'re saying is that -- is  that the naturalization results from the violation of  those laws.</p><p> Okay. So then -- I mean, it  makes me want to say, okay, what does it mean to procure  naturalization in the manner that violates other laws.  And then you talk about that. And you talk about that  on -- this -- the -- this is the only time I found in  the brief where you actually suggest what it means to\\n \\n38  procure naturalization in a way that -- in a manner that  violates other laws. And you say on page , what that  means is by violating those various laws. By violating  those various laws. And that made me think that\\'s a  causal requirement.</p><p> That\\'s such a shorter\\n\\n statement of my question. It\\'s perfect.\\n\\n (Laughter.)\\n\\n \\n42</p><p> -- to describe what it means\\n\\n and say in a manner that violates those laws.</p><p> I know. I\\'m sort of  suggesting that in trying to describe that you ended up  using the Petitioner\\'s formulation, and that seems quite\\n \\n\\n natural to me because I don\\'t know what other\\n\\n41\\n\\n formulation you could use --</p><p> Again, that the violation  led to the naturalization.</p><p> -- construction of the  language, you very naturally say you got the  naturalization by violating those laws, meaning that the  naturalization is the result of those -- that violation.  Because what else could you mean when you say -- when  you -- when you have a naturalization and you have these  violation of laws?</p><p> When you describe what you\\n \\n40  mean when you say in a manner that violates the laws,  it\\'s when you say, you say it\\'s by -- you -- you procure  naturalization by violating the laws, you very  naturally -- I think it\\'s a totally naturally - natural -</p><p> Please, I\\'m sorry. Finish\\n\\n up.</p><p> But what -- so what you\\'re  saying -- but we -- you -- I can just choose, you -- you  can tell me, your standard is in a manner that violates  other laws.</p><p> So on page , you say that  the question is whether Petitioner violated the law in  the course of procuring naturalization, in the course of  procuring naturalization. Then on page  and page ,  you say that the question is whether a person procures  naturalization in a manner that violates very -- that  violates other laws.\\n \\n37  Which are we talking about? Is it in the  course of or in a manner that violates other laws?</p><p> Because I guess I felt a  little bit confused on reading what your standard is.</p><p> Yeah.  Can I just ask you -- can I ask you to take  you through a few parts of your brief?</p><p> Although I am a little bit  horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight,  it has those kinds of consequences.  (Laughter.)</p><p> And you\\'ll be glad to know I  don\\'t have another of these questions for you.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Yeah.

How would you -- how  would you go about that? How would you say we\\'ve got to  decide why arbitration is being included in this?</p><p> Mr. Pincus, you  understand that when your first answer is, let\\'s go to  this case, that\\'s not the most compelling response.\\n \\n48</p><p> The first time the  statute is applied, it happens to be to an arbitration  case. It happens to be to this case. But you can\\'t say  oh, look in the background of it. It\\'s all about  hostility to arbitration. You can\\'t -</p><p> There\\'s nothing else  in there. The -- the first time -</p><p> Well, I know, but  the problem is -- is that it is, in terms of the  law-making authority, Kentucky would say to the supreme  court, you know, we make these rules through the courts  as we did in this case. And I just -- I guess I just  don\\'t see -- I -- I don\\'t think you\\'ve -- well, you  haven\\'t come up with a distinction that persuades me,  and that\\'s important because I think, as Justice Kagan  said, we have to assume the Kentucky Supreme Court is  acting in good faith.</p><p> We understand that.  But I\\'m talking about a legislative proposition. And it  doesn\\'t say anything about arbitration. It just says  powers of attorney. You can\\'t waive fundamental rights  unless it\\'s expressly stated.</p><p> -- doesn\\'t come up.\\n \\n46</p><p> There\\'s no talk  about arbitration. The word \"arbitration\" -</p><p> You have to look at  what\\'s going on in the case. So in my case where you  just have a statute, there\\'s nothing else to look at.  So how -- how -- I still don\\'t get why that would be  invalid.</p><p> It doesn\\'t single  out arbitration. That happens to be the issue before  it. I mean, basically, it seems to me what it\\'s coming  down to is you just don\\'t believe the Kentucky Supreme  Court when it says this is the general principle. And  you\\'re saying, well, I really think you\\'re hostile to  arbitration because I haven\\'t heard that principle  before and this is the first one. But you know, if - if the Kentucky legislature passes a law that does the  same thing, I mean, are you going to be suspicious of  them too just because arbitration might be the first  time it comes up?</p><p> It -- it says it  embodies the rule that the supreme -- Kentucky Supreme  Court adopted, which is that you can\\'t -- you can\\'t  waive fundamental rights, and like a lot of statutes,  it\\'s going to require some interpretation. But that\\'s  all it says. It says, you can\\'t -- you know, they\\'re  worried about the scope of powers of attorney, and they  say powers of attorney in Kentucky cannot waive  fundamental rights under the Constitution.</p><p> Yeah. But I mean,\\n\\n legislators -- legislatures often pass statutes that are\\n\\n underinclusive or overinclusive. So I don\\'t think that\\n\\n distinguishes the case.\\n\\n \\n41</p><p> The State could also\\n\\n enact a statute that says powers of attorney can\\'t\\n\\n waive -- can\\'t waive fundamental rights.

The FAA does not extend  beyond what?</p><p> Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Salyer.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. SALYER  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS</p><p> We\\'ll hear argument  today in Case -32, Kindred Nursing Centers v. Clark.  Mr. Pincus.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p><p> So you -</p>', 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>What about if the category\\n\\n were fundamental rights that implicate the -- the\\n\\n individual's life or health, so that you would have to\\n\\n have an express provision giving the attorney-in-fact\\n\\n authorization to consent to various procedures that a\\n\\n terminally ill person might undergo, and if this were\\n\\n put in that category?</p><p> Well, in this case, what's\\n\\n involved here is care for a -- a person who is unable to\\n\\n look after that -- that person's own care, an elderly\\n\\n person, a disabled person in a -- in a nursing facility.\\n\\n So what if that were lumped together with\\n\\n consent to surgery, consent to terminate feeding, or --\\n\\n or breathing for a terminally-ill patient. All of those\\n\\n could be put into a category that implicate life or\\n\\n health.</p><p> But the -</p><p> But the context here seems  different from the arbitration cases that we've had in  recent years. This doesn't involve an -- an arbitration  about the amount that you were charged for your cable  bill or for your telephone bill. This involves a  situation where an elderly person needs care.  And as Justice Kennedy's hypothetical  mentioned, it may be that the only facility that's  available, or all of the facilities, require the signing  of an -- an arbitration agreement which prevents the  assertion of tort claims and the -- the elimination of\\n \\n  the deterrents that they provide may really implicate  the care of someone who is vulnerable. So this seems  like something that is close to or that it falls  squarely within the police power of a State.  Now, I suppose that there's a connection  here to interstate commerce, I don't know what exactly  it is, but on the assumption that everything is  connected to interstate commerce, I assume that this  falls within the FAA.  But you see the problem? This is really  taking the arbitration precedence that we have handed  down in recent years into a different category of  interests.</p><p> Well, what about the  Wellner -- the Wellner documents. As I read what the  court said in the first part of its discussion about  that, it just interpreted the power of attorney as not  reaching arbitration. So there it was just exercising  its ordinary powers of contract interpretation.</p><p> Well, do you think every\\n\\n time a State court incorrectly interprets a power of\\n\\n attorney relating to -- as it relates to arbitration,\\n\\n that that raises an FAA preemption issue?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>If -- so the -- as I -- as\\n\\n I understand the question better, one, of course the\\n\\n legislature could enact such a statute.\\n\\n Two, if we have our first case arbitration\\n\\n and they say arbitration is included among it, then what\\n\\n we're job is is to read the opinion.\\n\\n Now, sometimes courts don't write enough in\\n\\n the opinion for us to make the decision as to whether or\\n\\n not it is being discriminated against, in which case we\\n\\n send it back and ask them to write more. So is that\\n\\n what we should do?</p><p> So isn't it that -- that  your answer is there's nothing wrong with that statute?\\n \\n47</p><p> And that, in fact, what the  statutes does, whether it covers arbitration or not, if  a court holds that it does cover arbitration, you have  to look to see whether the other things in there are  like arbitration sufficiently or there are other things  that aren't covered that are like arbitration  sufficiently, so that you could, at the end, draw a  conclusion that this is or is not discriminatory.</p><p> Right, right. And, by the  way, he makes a product, you know, the person who's  given the power of attorney. And as part of the  disagreement, the attorney -- a disagreement with OSHA.\\n \\n34  He agrees that OSHA can come in and inspect his plant at  various hours of the day or night. That kind of power  of attorney would be illegal also in Kentucky. I mean,  is there any State that makes that kind of power of  attorney illegal or requires it to be explicit somehow  that you could settle an ordinary OSHA case, you could  settle an ordinary competition case, you could settle an  ordinary, you know, patent case on fairly ordinary  terms, and it says when you give a power of attorney to  do that, you have to be explicit? Is there any State  other than Kentucky in this opinion that has ever held  such a thing? Maybe there is.</p><p> What do you say about the  competing product?</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> For that business anyway, a  lot of constitutional rights that might infringe. It  might if you didn't waive it. I don't know.</p><p> Well, what about business\\n\\n \\n33  settlements? What about business settlements where, you  know, there is a perfectly normal thing where a person  agrees not to compete, and in agreeing not to compete,  you're agreeing not to go to certain places?</p><p> Now -- now we say that you\\n\\n cannot enter into a power of attorney giving the power\\n\\n of attorney the power to enter into normal patent\\n\\n settlements.</p><p> You see, I don't know how\\n\\n to -- the part I don't know how to deal with your\\n\\n argument is, is you say every time I think of examples\\n\\n that would be very weird, which is what I'm trying to\\n\\n do, then -- then you say, oh, well, yeah, that's right.\\n\\n You can't do that anymore in Kentucky. And every time\\n\\n you say that, the law of Kentucky in terms of attorneys,\\n\\n powers of attorney is getting more and more peculiar.\\n\\n That's why I suspect something is going to happen there.\\n\\n So what should I -- what do you think?</p><p> Is there any case that\\n\\n suggests that -- except this case, which happens to deal\\n\\n with arbitration.</p><p> Can't -- can't give a  power -- general power of attorney that will allow a  person to settle a patent case on perfectly ordinary\\n \\n\\n terms.\\n\\n32</p><p> We give the power of  attorney to manage my patent, general. A lot of  litigation. The other side comes in and says, okay,  we'll settle. I'd like you to sign this paper, and this  says what you will say and what you won't say about my  patent. Absolutely normal. What you will say about  your patent, what you won't say about it in certain  areas. Can't do that in Kentucky, huh? Free speech.  Free speech.</p><p> No, that isn't this. You\\n\\n say that a attorney -- I'll be repeating myself. I'm\\n\\n testing out whether it's really true. Of course I'm\\n\\n highly suspicious as you can tell from my tone of voice.\\n\\n What I really think has happened is that Kentucky just\\n\\n doesn't like the Federal law. That's what I suspect.\\n\\n So they're not going to follow it. Now, that, of\\n\\n course, you're going to say, no, they would never do\\n\\n that. So I'm trying to test this out. And that's why I\\n\\n asked my question. Because it seems to me that\\n\\n \\n\\n arbitration as a means of settlement of a case, of a\\n\\n\\n\\n dispute, mediation as a means of settling a dispute, a\\n\\n judge as a means of settling a dispute, are equally and\\n\\n no different in the respect that none of those three\\n\\n involves a trial by jury.\\n\\n So I just want to know -- and you have\\n\\n already said, no, no, they're all different. Well, that\\n\\n to me proves that they're treating arbitration\\n\\n specially. So I put my whole argument there because I\\n\\n want you to have an opportunity to reply.</p><p> Unless you can find some\\n\\n difference.</p><p> All he did was say that in\\n\\n the attorney's judgment, if he wants to go to\\n\\n arbitration and thinks that's best, he can do it. Now,\\n\\n I just don't see the difference between that and\\n\\n implying, in the attorney's judgment, if he wants to\\n\\n settle a case, rather than going to a jury, he can do\\n\\n it. Or, if in the attorney's judgment, he would like a\\n\\n case tried before a judge instead of a jury, he can do\\n\\n it. And you're going to tell me that that's ridiculous\\n\\n to think that a general power of attorney would give the\\n\\n attorney the right to say, no jury, judge trial. No\\n\\n jury, mediator. Oh, but it makes perfect sense to say\\n\\n \\n\\n no jury, arbitrary -- arbitrator.\\n\\n\\n\\n Now, if you're not going to tell me that\\n\\n those are treated exactly alike, I will tell you in my\\n\\n opinion right now you have discriminated against\\n\\n arbitration --</p><p> So what's the difference\\n\\n between that and the case we have, where we're not going\\n\\n to have a mediator, we're not going to have settlement,\\n\\n we're not going to have a judge trial, we're going to\\n\\n have an arbitrator.</p><p> Oh, that's not right. Oh,  I see. In other words, you -- you -- you -- why -- why  isn't it right? Because after all, the fundamental  right of trial by jury is being -- you're giving the\\n \\n\\n attorney the power to refuse to have a jury.</p><p> Well, you just said  anything that waives the right to a jury is illegal  unless it's explicitly there. So, that's case one.  Case two, similar kind of argument, and the  lawyers for the two parties get together and say, we'd  like to settle this case. Illegal; right? No power,  they can't do it in Kentucky. Can't settle cases.  Can't have traces -- cases tried before a judge. Is  that right?</p><p> Now, the -- the attorney  says, in my opinion, I want this tried before a judge  because I think I'll get a fairer shake. Okay.  Illegal; right?</p><p> And someone claims that  this piece of land over here that we thought belonged to  Smith belongs to him under various deeds. All right?</p><p> So in Kentucky, I issue a\\n\\n power of attorney to Jones and say, you have full power\\n\\n to protect, defend and maximize the value of all my\\n\\n property. Okay. That's what it says.</p><p> In other words -</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Is there an explicit  reference -- to be effective, you've just told us, the  power of attorney has to explicitly state the -- that  disputes will be settled by an arbitration.  My question is whether there is any other  contract that in order to be made effectively in  Kentucky, it must be an explicit reference in the power  of attorney.</p><p> Is -- is there such an\\n \\n  explicit reference in the power of attorney with respect  to anything other than arbitration agreements?</p><p> And, Mr. Pincus, may I\\n\\n ask you a question about the wrongful death action,\\n\\n which everyone agrees does not belong to the patient; it\\n\\n belongs to -- to the survivors. And the same issues of\\n\\n negligence on the nursing home part would arise in the\\n\\n patient's suit as in the survivor's suit.\\n\\n Now, who determines which one goes first?\\n\\n Because if the -- if the survivor's action goes first\\n\\n and the nursing home is found liable, wouldn't the\\n\\n nursing home be bound by that in the arbitration?</p><p> What do you do with the  argument that this doesn't have to do with the  enforcement of an arbitration agreement? It goes to the  question of whether the agreement was ever formed or  made. That is, if it takes outside the power of  attorney, the power to enter into arbitration  agreements, so it's a question that goes to making that  enforcement.</p><p> Well, you say you're  distinguishing formation from enforcement, but we have  two separate agreements that both been formed the power  of attorney that's been concluded, the agent has signed  the arbitration agreement. So it's not a question of  the formation of those agreements; it's what -- what  they mean, what is the proper interpretation of the  power of attorney.</p><p> But what about the\\n\\n principle that making an arbitration agreement harder to\\n\\n form than other agreements violates the Federal\\n\\n Arbitration Act. As Mr. Pincus mentioned, the main rule\\n\\n is equal footing. Arbitration we thought to be on the\\n\\n same footing as all other contracts. If you make the\\n\\n arbitration agreement harder to form because you have to\\n\\n \\n\\n have this explicit reference than other contracts,\\n\\n36\\n\\n doesn't that discriminate against arbitration\\n\\n agreements?</p><p> So -- and your reasoning,\\n\\n I take it, that Kentucky could adopt a law that says\\n\\n agents lack authority to enter into arbitration on\\n\\n behalf of the principal.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>But how do we really know?  Are -- are you saying that a court can never announce a  generally applicable rule first in an arbitration case?</p><p> -- what I want to hear you  talk about, usually we don't presume that State courts  are acting in ways that are not in accordance with law.  Actually, we usually give them the benefit of a kind of  good faith presumption.  So if you're saying, well, no, they have to  prove it first in five other cases before we'll believe  them that they really do mean all constitutional rights,  that seems, you know, an unusual rule to apply to State  supreme courts who we usually think are acting in good  faith and in accordance with law.</p><p> Well, I know, but I want -</p><p> Suppose -- suppose we send  this back and we say we don't really believe you. We  think you're being hostile to arbitration, and they say,  well, prove it. And in five cases involving other  fundamental rights they do what Justice Breyer suggests  that they don't really have any intention of doing, but  they really do it. They say no, we're -- we're really\\n \\n44  serious about this. We think powers of attorney are - are -- are special things and we have to impose special  protections. And then it comes up here, you know, the  sixth time. They say, and arbitration too.  What do we do then?</p><p> Suppose -- well, suppose -</p><p> He cheated --</p><p> But that -- that suggests  that the arbitration is a preferred right, and I thought  that the idea of the FAA was to say it can't be - whatever, dis-preferred, un-preferred, you know -- but  not to put it on its own separate plane, like you can't  deal with this in the same way that you could deal with  any other fundamental right.\\n \\n42</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>In other words -- in other  words, for a number of years Kentucky had allowed powers  of attorney and the first time that one was called into\\n \\n\\n question under this theory was with reference to the\\n\\n\\n\\n arbitration.</p><p> Suppose Kentucky had a  statute providing that an attorney-in-fact lacks  authority to do a -- a -- a number of things: Convey\\n \\n\\n real property, move the principal's residence out of\\n\\n\\n\\n state, invest in foreign real estate, a few more\\n\\n examples like that, or sign an arbitration clause --\\n\\n arbitration contract. That's -- that's not this\\n\\n statute, I know.\\n\\n But at -- at some point, can arbitration\\n\\n clauses be included in a -- in a list of items that must\\n\\n be given special attention?</p><p> Well, in Justice Alito's  example, just to take it a little further, suppose the  nursing home said you cannot enter here unless you sign  the arbitration agreement, and this is the -- this is  the only place where this person can go for care. That  brings it closer to some of Justice Alito's examples  because now there's a danger that the care can't be  rendered.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>So how about a different  example, but more related in my mind right now.  Under Kentucky law, let's say, the power of  attorney requirements are strictly construed. That was  one of the principles that the court below used to  interpret at least one of the contracts.

Would this general principle be preempted by  the FFA -- by the FAA?</p><p> Mr. --</p><p> Following up on Justice\\n\\n Alito's question, and I know Ping is not before us, but\\n\\n applying your arguments to Ping, because the author of\\n\\n Ping dissented in these two cases, do you think Ping is\\n\\n closer to the neutral application of a contract\\n\\n interpretation?</p><p> I see --</p><p> No, no. I was going to\\n\\n say, Wellner is a little closer.</p><p> That's a pretty  powerful -</p><p> That's a pretty weak  argument that they've automatically made a special rule  for arbitration.

There wasn't a\\n\\n general contracting clause.

But I mean,  you know, that's funny, but the -- the fact is this is a  situation where he might well have elected to have more  prison time because it would keep him in -- in  Tennessee, close to his family, where he would be able  to visit his children, where he could even, as I think  the judge suggested, have some role in continuing to - to run the restaurant.\\n \\n36  What is -- what is like life at FPC  Millington? I take it it's not Alcatraz, right?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>What is --</p><p> But is that what you're\\n\\n asking us to do, to adopt a purely subjective standard?\\n\\n You say no.</p><p> But that points to a purely\\n\\n subjective test, which, as I said, is conceptually\\n\\n coherent, but creates a lot of practical difficulties,\\n\\n because then the Court is going to have to try to\\n\\n recreate what the defendant would have done. And, of\\n\\n \\n\\n course, after the defendant has been in prison for a\\n\\n\\n\\n while and is facing deportation, the person -- the\\n\\n person, I mean, I don't know, may have second thoughts.\\n\\n It's very hard to recreate that.</p><p> At what point does it become\\n\\n irrational?</p><p> I don't think that's - Mr. Bursch, I don't think that's a manageable standard.  I -- I see a number of possible standards that could be  used here. One is purely subjective: What would this  defendant have done? I understand the concept; it  creates a lot of practical difficulties.  Another objective standard would be, is\\n \\n  there a reasonable probability of a better outcome if  the defendant had gone to trial? That's manageable.  That's standard Strickland.  But if the test is, would a rational  defendant have in -- have gone to trial given the -- the  sentence that would be -- that the defendant might face  if convicted discounted by the probability of conviction  versus the consequences of -- of deportation, I -- I  don't know how to do that. It's -- it's -- because  it -- it depends on how a particular person values those  two things.</p><p> So you have a much more\\n\\n serious -- the potential for a much more serious\\n\\n sentence. Let's say, if the person is convicted, the\\n\\n person will serve eight years. And you have a person\\n\\n who has many more ties to the country to which the\\n\\n person would be removed.\\n\\n Now, how do you make that -- how do you\\n\\n \\n\\n decide whether that's rational?</p><p> Isn't it -- is it irrational  to try to climb Mount Everest without oxygen? I mean,  is it irrational to swim with sharks or perform on a  tightrope without a net? I mean, I wouldn't do those  things, but people do it. I can't say they're  irrational. They're much less risk averse and they  value things differently. I -- I think -</p><p> Well, I -- you have very\\n\\n sympathetic facts, but suppose we change the variables a\\n\\n bit. You know, they both can -- they both are a sliding\\n\\n scale.</p><p> -- it's an unmanageable  standard.</p><p> -- all of that is true on\\n\\n the facts of this case. But I have to ask the same\\n\\n question -- I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you\\n\\n can change the facts. So you have a defendant with more\\n\\n ties to Korea. He didn't come here as a young man. He\\n\\n came here when he was  years old.</p><p> He still has some relatives\\n\\n and friends in Korea. The sentence that he faces here\\n\\n is much higher. Let's say it's five years or it's eight\\n\\n years or it's ten years. At what point -- how do you\\n\\n decide whether it's rational.</p><p> Well --</p><p> Well, what would you do as a\\n\\n district -- how would you evaluate that as a district\\n\\n court judge?</p><p> Well, that --</p><p> That's a purely subjective\\n\\n \\n\\n test.</p><p> All of that --</p><p> What happens if there's\\n\\n overwhelming evidence that this defendant, that the\\n\\n defendant in the case would have gone to trial if the\\n\\n defendant knew about the deportation consequences,\\n\\n overwhelming subjective evidence, statements before the\\n\\n plea was entered, but also, virtually no chance of\\n\\n acquittal had the defendant gone to trial. What happens\\n\\n then?</p><p> But is that -</p><p> In this case or in any case.</p><p> No, I'm not proposing that\\n\\n test, but I'm -- I'm suggesting that that is the\\n\\n consequence of our saying that the test is purely\\n\\n subjective. We can't decide that this defendant would\\n\\n have, as a matter of fact, gone to trial had he been\\n\\n properly advised. That's a -- that's a factual\\n\\n question, purely historic fact. It would have to go\\n\\n back to a judge to make a finding of fact on that\\n\\n question.</p><p> I -- I understand the\\n\\n \\n\\n argument that the test should be purely subjective.\\n\\n54\\n\\n What would this defendant have done? There's language\\n\\n in Hill that supports that. The language that says is\\n\\n it rational under the circumstances is contrary to that,\\n\\n as I read it, because rationality is not a matter of --\\n\\n is not a subjective thing. It's objective.\\n\\n But let's say it is a purely subjective\\n\\n question. Then I think it's a question of historical\\n\\n fact. So you have to have a finding of fact by\\n\\n somebody, presumably the judge, in the 2255, and that\\n\\n would be reviewed for clear error. Would that --\\n\\n wouldn't that follow?</p><p> I -- I --</p><p> No, no, that's fine.</p><p> No, I -- finish your\\n\\n sentence. I'm sorry.</p><p> Because defendant --</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>All right. So -- so is  this the mistake you say that Judge Batchelder made is  she said: I will assume, at least, that your client  would have said I want to go to trial.  Question: Would that have been a rational  decision? Some circuits say if there is overwhelming  evidence of guilt, it\\'s never a rational decision. And  that\\'s what we say. And you want us to say that\\'s where  she was wrong.</p><p> And so send it back with  the knowledge that sometimes it could be rational for a\\n \\n\\n person to want to go to trial, even not hoping\\n\\n30\\n\\n necessarily for jury nullification. But sometimes it\\n\\n could be, and my client\\'s the guy.</p><p> And so judges go back to\\n\\n the district court, do it over again, knowing that\\n\\n overwhelming evidence is not always the end of the case.</p><p> Is that right?</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> We can\\'t do that. I mean,\\n\\n I don\\'t see --</p><p> I mean, the others, for\\n\\n myself, I don\\'t see how we don\\'t send it back. I\\'m not\\n\\n a trial judge. I don\\'t really know how trial defendants\\n\\n react, and -- and a trial judge does know that much\\n\\n better than I.</p><p> Well, that might --</p><p> What about murder? Suppose\\n\\n he thinks he\\'s going to be murdered if he\\'s sent abroad.\\n\\n Same problem.</p><p> But, I mean, I -- the\\n\\n problem is that he -- which you can read Judge\\n\\n Batchelder\\'s opinion. I mean, it could be read, as he\\n\\n says, that -- that if the evidence is overwhelming,\\n\\n that\\'s the end of the matter, and it wouldn\\'t have been\\n\\n rational to -- to ask for a trial. And now all we\\'ve\\n\\n done is think of situations where it might be. I mean,\\n\\n he thinks he\\'s going to be sent back to some country in\\n\\n the world and it\\'s going to end up he\\'s dead, as is his\\n\\n family. He\\'d rather be in jail.\\n\\n Now, we\\'re not supposed to take that into\\n\\n account? Why not?</p><p> So step back a second. And  I agree with you. I can\\'t find total clarity in -- in\\n \\n\\n these decisions. And it seemed to me that if we\\'re\\n\\n45\\n\\n making the separation, as they made, between what you\\n\\n look to, to show prejudice in a plea agreement and at a\\n\\n trial, both Strickland errors, it must be that the\\n\\n constitutional consideration of not really wanting a\\n\\n person to feel he has to give up his right to a jury\\n\\n trial, that influences the standard. And if it doesn\\'t\\n\\n influence the standard, I have a harder time deciding\\n\\n the cases.\\n\\n So, really, I think what we\\'re deciding here\\n\\n is to what extent it influences the standard.</p><p> And -- and -- and you --\\n\\n you see how I\\'m thinking that?</p><p> Because there\\'s a kind of\\n\\n just look to the plea, just look to the plea. Don\\'t\\n\\n give a damn about what happens at trial. Well, we can\\'t\\n\\n get that extreme. So we say, well, we\\'ll look just at\\n\\n the plea. But if it\\'s just overwhelming, then we\\'re\\n\\n going to say we\\'re looking to the trial, too. Okay.\\n\\n If I\\'m right as to what these cases mean,\\n\\n then we are in a world where 95 percent of the people\\n\\n and what happens to them depend upon pleas, not upon\\n\\n trials. And doesn\\'t that argue for \"look to that plea\"\\n\\n \\n46  part of the thing? Don\\'t worry so much about whether  he\\'d been convicted at trial. In other words, we\\'re  talking about very small degrees here. But that factor  seems to me to -- to push in the direction of, if you  really think he would have gone to trial, that should be  the end of it, even if he\\'s pretty irrational.</p><p> This is what they say. It  says at the end there that it\\'s alongside -- I mean, she  says: Alongside -- we adjoin the second to the -- that  a claimant\\'s ties to the United States should be taken  into account in evaluating alongside the legal merits.</p><p> Let\\'s consider them all.</p><p> And suppose one of them is  there\\'s no hope of success at trial except jury  nullification.</p><p> Right.</p><p> Uh-huh.</p><p> All Right. That was a good  point. So imagine that your lawyers below in this very  case went to the government and said, look, everybody\\n \\n\\n was under a mistake here. Why don\\'t you go to the\\n\\n\\n\\n district court with me.</p><p> We jointly will tell them,\\n\\n the judge, that not -- what would have happened if he\\'d\\n\\n gotten good advice, is the government would have figured\\n\\n something out to help him. The government would have\\n\\n charged him with a -- a lesser crime. And my guess is\\n\\n you did that, and my guess is the government wouldn\\'t do\\n\\n it.</p><p> What is the -</p><p> No hope for you. Well,  what do you want us to do?</p><p> So what we -- what you want  us to do is to add to what she said. And what you have  to mean by that is it would have been no hope for you at  trial. That\\'s the reason.</p><p> All right. So -- so wait.\\n\\n You -- even if it\\'s irrational?</p><p> Well --</p><p> Well, I\\'m not sure she did\\n\\n that. I thought that she said -- my reading of it was\\n\\n she tried to follow what we\\'ve said.</p><p> And -- and in particular --\\n\\n in particular, she said, look, this person would have\\n\\n been faced with a choice. So you started with your\\n\\n example. In your example, it would have been nuts to\\n\\n reject the plea bargain. The guy would have ended up in\\n\\n the same place, deported, and he would have been in jail\\n\\n for a lot more time.\\n\\n \\n  She says, here it\\'s the same. He would have  ended up being deported anyway. The lawyer would have  had to tell him, your chance of winning this trial is  zero, near zero, close to zero, and you\\'ll have served  an extra -- at least an extra  to  months because  you\\'ll be in jail for  to  months more, and the same  thing will happen to you anyway. Who would want that?  It might be more than  to  months, because the  chances of departure are smaller.  Okay. So now I can repeat, and you started  in answering the Chief Justice: What\\'s different about  this case? And I\\'d say there are factual differences  and there are legal differences. Start with the legal  differences -</p><p> -- and then tell us the  factual differences, why they matter.</p><p> I thought she said only if  the only hope for him is jury nullification.</p><p> All right.</p><p> -- it\\'s the same question\\n\\n differently, but it\\'s meant to be the same question.\\n\\n What is the precise mistake of law that you think that\\n\\n the Sixth -- that the Sixth Circuit -- that Judge\\n\\n Batchelder made?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>But here, the plea is --\\n\\n is a different thing. The plea -- there is no trial\\n\\n error. And the defendant says, if I were properly\\n\\n informed, I would exercise my constitutional right to a\\n\\n jury trial. And it doesn't -- the Constitution doesn't\\n\\n say I have to be rational in making that choice. I have\\n\\n a right to a jury trial.</p><p> Isn't this case, Mr. --\\n\\n Mr. -- is unlike Strickland in this sense? In\\n\\n Strickland, so it's a trial error and the Court can --\\n\\n \\n\\n can determine whether it's harmless.</p><p> -- what the facts are.\\n \\n47  But isn't it sometimes a prosecutor might say, I have a  solid case, the evidence is overwhelming, but this is a  nice young man and the jury might be sympathetic, so  rather than risk nullification, if you call it that, why  not give the jury an opportunity to convict him on the  lesser, so at least there will be a conviction?</p><p> Yeah, I know what the -</p><p> What is the answer to the  lesser-included offense? Was that -- is that out of the  picture?</p><p> Is there a possibility -</p><p> That's exactly what we  said the standard is, and I think you're just asking us  to -- to adhere to that standard.</p><p> Justice Kagan pointed out  that the test that you're asking us to apply is the test  that this Court says is applicable at the plea stage.  Is there a reasonable probability, but for counsel's  error, defendant would not have pleaded guilty, but  would have insisted on his right to trial?</p><p> So if the prosecutor  doesn't want to do possession, the -- the trial court  can't do it?</p><p> And if the -- the  defense -- the offense of possession does not carry  adverse deportation consequences. So is it -- is that  determination whether to charge the lesser -- give the  jury the choice between with intent to distribute and a  plain possession -- is that in the -- in the discretion  of the judge?</p><p> I mean, this is a  possession-with-intent-to-distribute. Suppose the  defendant asks the judge, please charge the lesser  offense of possession.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>-- regardless of what the\\n\\n state of the evidence was; right?</p><p> -- finish the question.\\n\\n I mean, you would agree that there's a\\n\\n constitutional right to go to trial, regardless of what\\n\\n the --</p><p> -- there's a constitutional  right to go to trial, isn't there?</p><p> Well, let me just --</p><p> Even if there's -- even if\\n \\n\\n there's very weak evidence on your side.\\n\\n49</p><p> Well --</p><p> This is what -- this is what  Hill says, Mr. Feigin. It just says, here's the  standard: The defendant must show that there's a  reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, he  would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on  going to trial.  That's what we're trying to determine,  whether he would have insisted on going to trial.</p><p> So to the contrary, when\\n \\n\\n Hill keeps on going, it says, you know, this -- this\\n\\n40\\n\\n defendant didn't care about his parole eligibility, so\\n\\n we shouldn't -- we shouldn't look at the fact that\\n\\n the -- the parole eligibility was a bad deal for him\\n\\n because he didn't care.\\n\\n So the emphasis clearly in Hill is -- is\\n\\n what are the things that would have made a difference --</p><p> -- in the plea negotiation?</p><p> Which is the question that\\n\\n Justice Sotomayor asked you. And she said, and why\\n\\n isn't this correct?\\n\\n So then the question is, has there been\\n\\n deficient performance? And a person's entitlement to go\\n\\n to trial and entitlement to stare at all the various\\n\\n probabilities and to make an informed choice, that\\n\\n entitlement has been taken away by the supremely\\n\\n \\n50  deficient performance. And that should be the question.</p><p> What Padilla is saying,\\n\\n isn't it, Mr. Feigin, is essentially, look, this is not\\n\\n going to be a case where somebody can just get up and\\n\\n say this is what I would have done and the court has to\\n\\n \\n\\n accept it.\\n\\n41\\n\\n No, Padilla says. The court doesn't have to\\n\\n accept every claim that a defendant makes. A court can\\n\\n test those claims against a notion of rationality,\\n\\n against a notion of what reasonable people would do.\\n\\n But still, the -- the essence of the inquiry is what\\n\\n would -- what would have happened at the plea\\n\\n negotiation, not what would have happened at the trial.</p><p> -- that's confusing two  things. And this goes back to the point that the Chief  Justice made, is that you keep on saying what's the  probability that the jury wouldn't have convicted him,  but that's not the question, and we made this clear in  Hill and in other cases.  The question is: What's the -- what's the  -- what's the probability that the relevant proceeding  would have been different? And here the relevant  proceeding is the plea negotiation and the plea  agreement. And that's the thing that we're looking at  is did this deficient performance lead to a different  decision by this -- by Mr. Lee to go to trial or not, to  plea or not. And that's all we're supposed to be  looking at here, according to Hill.  Now, that has its difficulties, as  Justice Alito said. What exactly do we look to? How do  we draw lines? There's no question that this is, in  some cases, an uncomfortable inquiry. But that's the  inquiry we're supposed to be making, isn't it? And you\\n \\n39  keep flipping it to a different inquiry, which is the  inquiry in a trial context, but not in a plea context.</p><p> -- Mr. Feigin. I think -</p><p> You don't mean that. I  think -- because I think what you just said was that  there's no constitutional right to go to trial when  there's no evidence?</p><p> Of course -</p><p> You don't mean that -</p><p> You see -</p><p> Strickland is a very  different case in that -- in that way. Because what  Strickland says is once you're at a trial, you're right  is to a fair and accurate trial. And nullification has  nothing to do with a fair and accurate trial.  But this is before. This is when you're  trying to decide whether to exercise that right to go to  trial. And there, what you're entitled to is that a  lawyer be able to give you, in a nondeficient way, the  various circumstances, the various things that you would  consider to enable you to make that constitutional - constitutionally protected decision in a reasonable way.</p><p> Well, all you're asking the  judge to do is to say that in certain circumstances, it  is not beyond the bounds of reasonableness to throw the  dice in order to get an outcome -- in order to get -- in  order not to be deported from a country where you've  lived your whole life.</p><p> Well, the court can do it in\\n\\n the way that the Court has done it since 1985 when we\\n\\n said that this was the inquiry under Hill. This is what\\n\\n courts have been doing since -- for the last 30 years.</p><p> It's an objectively  reasonable assessment, it's an -- it -- it would be an  objectively reasonable choice to exercise my right to a  jury trial in that context. And that's the question,  whether it's objectively reasonable to make a decision  different from the decision that I would have made in  this proceeding, which is the plea negotiation.</p><p> But, Mr. Feigin, again\\n\\n \\n58  the -- just in your words, objective reasonableness, why  can't a judge find as to a defendant that it is  objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine  months for a shot at staying in this country rather than  being deported to a place that you don't know and where  you have no ties? I mean, you know, if somebody gave me  that choice, sign me up.  So I think of myself as an objectively  reasonable human being.</p><p> It's what many courts have\\n\\n been doing for three decades.</p><p> And that is the Hill test,\\n\\n right?</p><p> But the key is that the\\n\\n outcome of the proceeding here is not the outcome of the\\n\\n trial, as it usually is in a Strickland case. The\\n\\n outcome of the proceeding here is the outcome of the\\n\\n plea negotiation.</p><p> I mean, this is not your\\n\\n test.</p><p> We've said that.</p><p> And the plea proceeding\\n\\n might be very affected by somebody saying, you know,\\n\\n given my ties to this country, given my negative ties to\\n\\n any other country, given the fact that this is only a\\n\\n nine-month difference in prison term, I'm going to roll\\n\\n the dice for that  percent chance.</p><p> But here, the inquiry is\\n\\n different. The inquiry is not the outcome of the trial.\\n\\n The inquiry is the outcome of the plea proceeding.</p><p> I would have thought that\\n\\n the -- that -- that the difference is more fundamental,\\n\\n which is that usually in Strickland, we are asking what\\n\\n was going to happen at trial.</p><p> And that would be a\\n\\n completely reasonable thing to do, a thing that many\\n\\n people would do.</p><p> And we don't think, well,\\n\\n there was this  percent chance that the witness would\\n\\n drop dead. We put that to the side.</p><p> This is a test that's\\n\\n staring at me on page 59 of volume 474.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>This -- this is a  little -- little bit different question -</p><p> Well, except -</p><p> The judge, after advising  him of many of his rights, says: Are you a U.S.  citizen?

What were -- did he\\n\\n have lots of ties? Did he have lots of families, to\\n\\n Korea? He had none? I just don't see how, A, a -- a\\n\\n trial judge can do that other than on a strictly\\n\\n case-by-case basis, which is nonreviewable. This is\\n\\n just like a jury question.</p><p> All right. But -- but - let's -- the question -- but the question that was - was -- was put to you with reference to Strickland was  in the context of what might happen at a trial with  different evidence, with different arguments. We know  how to do that. Judges know how to do that.  You're asking us how -- how to assess the  mindset of -- of the defendant when -- when he or she  makes the plea. That's very different.</p><p> Well, I -- I understand  you -- you call your test an objective test. You - you -</p><p> I -- I understand that.  But the question is whether or not it isn't so distinct  from Strickland as to be unworkable.</p><p> All right.

I\\n\\n mean, not only is there a video, there\\'s witnesses,\\n\\n there\\'s fingerprints, you name it, they\\'re there, and\\n\\n defendants will come in and say I\\'m not guilty. And we\\n\\n say, you know, he\\'s foolish, he\\'s irrational. No\\n\\n rational human being would not take this plea, the\\n\\n difference between 50 years and five years, and yet, we\\n\\n deny their motion to undo their plea because we\\n\\n basically say it\\'s subjective.

If the difference between going\\n\\n \\n  to jail or not is only nine months, I might say: Hmm,  hundred percent chance I\\'m going to be deported.

I kept telling him the\\n\\n56\\n\\n evidence was overwhelming, that he should take the plea,\\n\\n but he kept telling me I\\'m innocent. It doesn\\'t require\\n\\n a hearing for a judge to say that defendant would not\\n\\n have pled guilty because he was claiming his innocence.\\n\\n Those cases wouldn\\'t change either.\\n\\n Those are a good majority of the cases that\\n\\n come before district and circuit courts.</p><p> Well, I still go back\\n\\n to -- to my earlier point, which is the difference\\n\\n between nine years and five and ten years is very big.\\n\\n For nine months and sure banishment? What\\'s so\\n\\n irrational about going to trial?</p><p> Mr. Feigin - Mr. Feigin, routinely papers come in from a Petitioner  who says, my lawyer didn\\'t do X. Most commonly, the  lawyer comes in and says I did do X. And most commonly,  the district court says the lawyer told me I did X, and  at the pea -- plea colloquy I asked that question and  the defendant said yes, I understood that consequence,  and the court doesn\\'t have a hearing.  A ruling in our case wouldn\\'t change those  cases.</p><p> So what do we do -- what\\n\\n do we do with all those defendants who reject pleas with\\n\\n full knowledge and say a rational person must have\\n\\n wanted -- should have taken this case. And so you\\n\\n should vacate because I didn\\'t take my plea. Don\\'t look\\n\\n at all the facts and circumstances. Don\\'t look at any\\n\\n of the arguments because it\\'s only a rationality test.</p><p> How many of them are\\n\\n being granted?</p><p> I think the district\\n\\n court said here that this defendant would have gone to\\n\\n trial.</p><p> And what they said was\\n\\n the absolute rule of this circuit is --</p><p> -- what led this\\n\\n district court judge to say I believe this person would\\n\\n have gone to trial, but this rule doesn\\'t permit me to\\n\\n rule in his favor.</p><p> There\\'s always --</p><p> There\\'s always --\\n\\n there\\'s always a set of degrees. I mean, whether or not\\n\\n we talk about this rational person would have accepted,\\n\\n how much of a defense and how viable is the defense?\\n\\n Would  percent defense versus  percent defense,\\n\\n 30 percent defense? At some point the district court is\\n\\n going to draw a rationality line that they think is\\n\\n reasonable, correct?</p><p> So if -- if there -- if\\n\\n there\\'s a defense that has a  percent chance, is that\\n\\n okay, versus one that has a  percent chance? Or how\\n\\n do you even measure how rational a potential defense may\\n\\n be --</p><p> -- if the inquiry is how\\n\\n much do we know he would or would not have taken this\\n\\n plea?</p><p> There\\'s no question --</p><p> Mr. Feigin, you know,  we\\'re talking about cases like this, the circuits are  split. The vast majority of them do the reasonable  probability test and don\\'t seem to have the problems  you\\'re talking about.  Do you know how many of these motions there\\n \\n\\n are?\\n\\n52</p><p> And if he has that  right, aren\\'t we depriving him of that right and the  right to a trial, both of them guaranteed by the  Constitution -- as I keep saying, a plea is not -- to  have his attorney try everything that is legally  permissible to try? None of these attempts -- and your  adversary went on for pages of the variety of different\\n \\n48  ways for him to have achieved a nondeportation plea as a  possibility. Doesn\\'t he have a right to have someone  try that for him?</p><p> He has a constitutional  right to effective counsel.</p><p> I\\'m sorry -</p><p> What\\'s the windfall?\\n\\n You\\'re entitled to a constitutional trial. But putting\\n\\n that aside, you\\'re not entitled to a plea. You\\'re not\\n\\n entitled to a lesser sentence. You\\'re entitled to go to\\n\\n jail if you want to. Isn\\'t that what we said in\\n\\n Dominguez Benitez in a Rule  Strickland evaluation?\\n\\n We said that a court should, quote, \"Not\\n\\n second guess a defendant\\'s actual decision if it is\\n\\n reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent\\n\\n the error, it is no matter that the choice may have been\\n\\n foolish.\"\\n\\n Now, that\\'s Strickland under Rule , and\\n\\n it\\'s the same inquiry. Would he have pled guilty if he\\n\\n had known this information? And we explicitly said your\\n\\n decision can be foolish.</p><p> It\\'s not an analogy. It\\n\\n talks about Strickland in the Rule  context.</p><p> So here we have a\\n\\n defense attorney who says: I didn\\'t know the law. I\\n\\n told him he wouldn\\'t be deported. And if I had known\\n\\n the law, I would have told him to go to trial.</p><p> So this is both\\n\\n prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to\\n\\n go -- move forward.</p><p> Or not move forward.</p><p> Wait a minute.</p><p> I\\'m sorry -</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': '<p>Thank you, counsel.

You are saying the problems\\n\\n \\n\\n would be there for Texas corporations that actually\\n\\n45\\n\\n reside in that district anyway. So we shouldn\\'t worry\\n\\n that  percent of the nationwide cases are there?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>-- and - (Laughter.)</p><p> So in other words -</p><p> B doesn\\'t apply because of  the words in A, except as otherwise provided by law.</p><p> Okay.</p><p> A.</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> Okay. So why, if it\\n\\n governs B, does it not govern C? The words except as\\n\\n otherwise provided by law you\\'ve just said, and I think\\n\\n you are absolutely right as far as I understand it.\\n\\n That those words govern B. They govern A and they govern\\n\\n B, then why don\\'t they govern C?</p><p> That might be--</p><p> So -- so -- I know, but B\\n\\n is in a separate section.</p><p> And now C is the next\\n\\n section, so why doesn\\'t it govern that?</p><p> I laugh slightly because\\n\\n if -- if that is so clear what is this case doing here,\\n\\n and -- and it -- that\\'s why -- that\\'s why I can\\'t cut\\n\\n one way or the other with that -- that particular\\n\\n argument. I mean, you would think the patent holders\\n\\n are a tremendously powerful group of people, businesses\\n\\n all over the country, and if they had been -- why\\n\\n \\n\\n weren\\'t they in Congress? See, that -- that\\'s a\\n\\n49\\n\\n Congressional problem. Why weren\\'t they there saying we\\n\\n have a problem here, why don\\'t you clarify it? You -- I\\n\\n don\\'t think you can answer that question --</p><p> -- until I get -- you can?\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> You asked me this\\n \\n39  question -- answer this. I -- I\\'m not an expert in this  area, comparatively speaking, so you need -- I need  enlightenment here.  Think of A-. This section shall govern the  venue of all civil actions brought in district courts.  Okay. So what\\'s an example of one that it doesn\\'t  govern, where the law provides otherwise?</p><p> Obviously, you think you  win. And -- and.</p><p> That\\'s fine. That\\'s the  correct way to handle it?</p><p> I mean, look -- look.  You -- if you -- if you\\'re right, you win. That\\'s the  end of the case. If you\\'re wrong, then you have another  point, and that is that Fourco doesn\\'t apply really to  unincorporated associations. So why isn\\'t the right  thing to do for us to decide the issue, if you win,  that\\'s the end of it; and if you lose, you send it back  and we say to the lower court, if you haven\\'t forfeited  the point, maybe you could raise it and argue it.  Is that the correct way to handle this?</p><p> Why another case?</p><p> In -- special or there are  lots of different ones. But did it say, if you pass  this, don\\'t worry about getting rid of 1400, because  this gets rid of it? I mean, did they say anything like  that at all?</p><p> Well, I mean, getting rid  of Fourco.</p><p> Did it say anything -</p><p> I mean -- when I used to --\\n \\n32  maybe this was years ago. This said, don\\'t worry about  repealing 1400. If you pass this, you will be rid of  the Supreme Court\\'s interpretation in Fourco. Or  anything like that.</p><p> Okay. Okay.</p><p> And so I should look at\\n\\n what case?</p><p> But you are not an\\n\\n incorporation, so I\\'m back to my first question.</p><p> Yeah. It says in respect\\n\\n of corporations, it means the state of incorporation\\n\\n only.</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> And Fourco is going really\\n\\n into whether 1391(c) or -- whether they made an\\n\\n exception, whether they included that, and it says no.\\n\\n It\\'s a very short opinion.</p><p> And now \"inhabitant,\" how  do we know that means where the incorporation is  incorporated or something? What does that mean in the  case of -- how do we know that that -- that that word\\n \\n\\n \"inhabitant\" means what you think it means?\\n\\n\\n\\n What do you think it means?</p><p> But then that incorporated  Section 48. And Section 48 said where the defendant is  an inhabitant.</p><p> Now, as long as you have a  minute, maybe you could indulge me and trace me through  this. With a corporation, I think 1400 says resides,  where the defendant resides.</p><p> Well, I do, actually.</p><p> Including a person.</p><p> Is there a holding that it\\n\\n includes you?</p><p> That is, you\\'re asking us\\n\\n to decide where venue is proper for a corporation, and\\n\\n you are not a corporation. Therefore, on what basis are\\n\\n we supposed to decide that?</p><p> You can go into that if you\\n\\n want. As far as that -- might be other people are\\n\\n interested in that. But I really feel I need an answer\\n\\n to my second question.</p><p> I don\\'t quite see -- two\\n \\n\\n things; one, you can comment on it or not, but these\\n\\n\\n\\n amici briefs, and -- they\\'re filled with this thing\\n\\n about a Texas district which they think has too many\\n\\n cases. What\\'s this got to do with this? As far as I\\n\\n can see, if we\\'re supposed to decide what\\'s good or bad,\\n\\n maybe you\\'d lose. But I -- I don\\'t know whether that\\'s\\n\\n good, bad, or indifferent. Okay? But is there some\\n\\n relevance to it?\\n\\n And the second thing that I\\'d like to know\\n\\n is you are not a corporation. So since you are not a\\n\\n corporation, why do we have this case here deciding?\\n\\n And what are we supposed to do about that? We don\\'t\\n\\n normally decide cases because Mr. Smith would like us to\\n\\n decide a case involving a corporation. He\\'s not a\\n\\n corporation, nor are you. So what do we do?</p><p> Look. I -- I\\'m -- I\\'m not  worried about it if you win.

In other words, your argument in the end rests on that  \"except\" provision?</p><p> But, Mr. Dabney, I mean, one  oddity of this case is -- is usually, when we say  something, when we issue a decision, we can be pretty  confident that Congress is acting against the backdrop  of that -- that decision. But I think that that would  be an odd thing to say in this case, given that for 30  years the Federal Circuit has been ignoring our decision  and the law has effectively been otherwise. And then\\n \\n\\n the question is, well, what is the backdrop against\\n\\n\\n\\n which Congress is legislating.\\n\\n It seems actually that if -- if I were a\\n\\n congressman, I\\'d think that the practical backdrop\\n\\n against which I\\'m legislating is not Fourco; it is\\n\\n instead the Federal Circuit\\'s decision in VE Holding,\\n\\n which is the decision that the practice has conformed\\n\\n to.</p><p> But, Mr. Jay, can I just ask  you -- and this is a clarification question, and maybe I  should know this. But you have the original 1391, which  was the subject of Fourco.</p><p> What do -</p><p> What do you think Congress  would have to do to reverse our decision in Fourco?</p><p> But I thought the ALI -- and  you -- you rely upon it in your briefs a lot and you  rely on it here. I mean, the ALI wanted to get rid of  1400, and Congress didn\\'t do that.</p><p> Well, but for more than 30\\n\\n \\n\\n years the practice has been the other way. I mean,\\n\\n\\n\\n I\\'m -- I\\'m -- I was thinking as I was reading the\\n\\n briefs, sometimes we have accidental theme days at the\\n\\n Supreme Court. So today\\'s accidental theme is: When 30\\n\\n years of practice goes against you, what happens?\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Then you have the 1988  amendment. Then you have the 2011 amendment?</p><p> Yes, but 1400 was within the  chapter -</p><p> -- so the effect was exactly  the same, wasn\\'t it?</p><p> But the complaint is that it\\n\\n allows a kind of forum shopping, right? That it --\\n\\n you -- let\\'s go down to Texas where we can get the\\n\\n benefit of a certain set of rules.</p><p> So why is \"for all purposes\"  different from \"for venue purposes\" or \"for purposes of  venue\" under this chapter? Why isn\\'t it all the same?</p><p> Is it the 2011 amendment  that you think changed things, or is it also the 1988  amendment?

I think it's much  more significant if you have things spinning out of the  bankruptcy estate being adjudicated elsewhere than the  fact that you might have it as a general matter in -- in  district courts.</p><p> Are there other  defenses to a debt that you would say are covered by  your theory other than the statute of limitations? For  example, that the -- the debt was incurred to a contract  of adhesion or, you know, the -- the normal list of  reasons that a debt might be unenforceable. Does your  theory apply to all of those?</p><p> Well -- well, but\\n\\n how do you know that's the case in the statute of\\n\\n limitations with respect to a statute of limitations\\n\\n defense?

Would there be anything -- suppose  a trustee or the attorney for a debtor said, I am going  to -- let's say this case is in Alabama. The statute of  limitations for the collection of debt in Alabama is six  years. I am going to object to every -- any claim for a  debt that was incurred more than six years ago.  Would -- would that be inconsistent with the duties of  the trustee or the attorney?</p><p> Well, I'll -- I'll ask  Mr. Geyser the same question, but it -- I can't  understand why a trustee or an attorney wouldn't take  that -- wouldn't take that approach -</p><p> -- automatically object to  anything that is over the -- the statute of limitations.</p><p> Do you think this good faith\\n\\n defense is objective or subjective?</p><p> It's objective?</p><p> As legal matter, it would be\\n\\n under your interpretation.\\n\\n \\n53</p><p> Subjective.

I thought an affirmative  defense was a rule of law that may allow the defendant  to prevail if the defendant asserts the defense. But  you want to switch -- you're switching that over to the  side of the plaintiff or the person filing the claim.  It seems inconsistent with the whole idea of an  affirmative defense.  The idea of an affirmative defense -- let's  take statute of limitations. The idea is that the  defendant may escape liability based on the statute of  limitations, but only if a defendant asserts the defense  and, if necessary, proves it. And if a defendant  doesn't do that, then the law is perfectly content with  having a recovery on a claim that would have otherwise  been time barred.</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Sorry.

Some of these, you know, are quite\\n\\n complicated.</p><p> And, therefore, we\\'re now\\n\\n going to have the Article III judge -- maybe not in some\\n\\n cases, but in many cases -- deciding pretty complicated\\n\\n things as matters of bankruptcy law growing out of a\\n\\n bankruptcy case.\\n\\n Now, if that\\'s wrong, why is it wrong?</p><p> No, no. You missed my\\n\\n whole point. You said it applies to all affirmative\\n\\n defenses.</p><p> Is the only affirmative\\n\\n defense statute of limitations?</p><p> Then think of the most\\n\\n complicated one you can think of and let\\'s talk about\\n\\n that one.</p><p> So what you\\'re saying is a  set of cases that would warrant a sanction under Rule  9011, if I said to the bankruptcy judge, who happens to  know something about it because he\\'s heard the case, if\\n \\n38  I were to ask him -- but who\\'s going to bother to ask  him? Because I get my attorneys\\' fees and a thousand  dollars and et cetera. If I go into this other court  before a judge who doesn\\'t know about it and just  issue -- have a litigate on an easy issue, an easy  issue, the state of mind of the individual creditor, ah,  yes. It\\'s just state of mind. I grant you the easy  thing about state of mind is it\\'s only three words, and  the difficult thing is, of course, proving what it was.  Now -- now do you see what is worrying me?</p><p> In this case, is it -- is  there something in the record? I mean, it\\'s rather  surprising to me that there is a company and their  business model, you say, is to go around buying up debts  that can\\'t be enforced and are worthless, and then  filing cases hoping that no one will notice. Is that  shown in the record? I mean, is somebody -- they admit  that\\'s their business model? Where does this come from?</p><p> The FTC says that\\'s what  they did.</p><p> Why didn\\'t the FTC then  bring an action against them if that\\'s what they\\'re  doing?\\n \\n44</p><p> We then have the FTC that  could do such a thing. We have the sanctions in the  Bankruptcy Code, and now you want this, too?</p><p> It\\'s bankruptcy and that\\'s  what worries me. Of course there will be a set of  claims where the person is behaving pretty badly. But  there\\'s a remedy right in the Code. It\\'s called a  sanction. Moreover, if they really go around doing  this, I don\\'t know why the FTC wouldn\\'t bring a claim  saying this is an unfair business practice. So if in  fact you say they also have a remedy under this other  act, it\\'s quite possible, given the remedies that they  have under the other act, that lawyers won\\'t move for  sanctions. They won\\'t bother with it.</p><p> They will go right into  court and then we\\'ll have two sets of courts and other  people trying to decide the same question. The same  problem that was bothering me  minutes ago and I\\'d  like to -- I\\'d like to know what you think of that.</p><p> If that\\'s so, then why  not -- what about this. It\\'s a little complicated as a  solution and so I\\'m pretty nervous. I don\\'t know that  I\\'d really do this. But you\\'d say okay. The word in  the debt collection act is unfair and where it\\'s in  bankruptcy, there\\'s a whole system to decide if it\\'s  unfair by people who know about it. So where a  bankruptcy court does in fact say that it\\'s unfair and  sanctions a party for this unfair behavior. In that  case, it\\'s unfair within the meaning of the debt  collection act and in that case, you can go and bring  your extra remedy.</p><p> Why can\\'t they consent?\\n\\n \\n56  Suppose it\\'s Chapter ? Suppose they\\'re trying to get  a plan? Suppose the plan is a company that does  business in countries -- I know you don\\'t believe there  are such countries, but there are, there are countries  where it\\'s a matter of honor to pay a debt. And people  actually do pay debts.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Is -- is it just the  statute of limitations you\\'re talking about, or is it  all affirmative defenses?</p><p> It may not be. I mean it  depends on the circumstance. But that isn\\'t what\\'s  bothering me and I -- and I put it in a sort of -- you  have a very good argument. I\\'m not saying you don\\'t.  I\\'m telling you what\\'s worrying me.  What\\'s worrying me is that we take a set of\\n \\n33  cases, which now you\\'ve -- you\\'ve narrowed it to that  set which is sanctionable under Rule 9011, which is a  bankruptcy rule with sanctions. And you\\'re saying in  addition to the sanctions, the person who -- the debtor  can go and bring a different case now under the word  \"unfair\" in the debt collection act.  And I\\'m saying what\\'s worrying me, and I\\'d  like to hear what you say specifically, is that here we  have two sets of courts; one with the power to sanction;  the other the ordinary Article III court, which  presumably will automatically give $,000 per violation,  you know, plus attorneys\\' fees, plus costs. And that  seems what the bankruptcy court was trying to avoid. We  want bankruptcy matters decided in bankruptcy court.  Now, I don\\'t think I have a convincing  argument against you. I have a point. And I\\'d like to  hear what you have to say in response.</p><p> Oh. Only when the creditor  comes in and says, I admit I had no good-faith reason  for bringing this. That\\'s the only thing your theory\\n \\n\\n covers?</p><p> Is that outside its  purpose?</p><p> All right. So you could - it\\'s easy to think of cases.</p><p> Well, then what that means  is that not just in this case, not just with statute of  limitations, that -- that there are a whole set of  claims that can be brought in bankruptcy where you would  say they don\\'t. They don\\'t have a reasonable good faith  belief. And, of course, what they say is we do. We do  have a good faith belief. Okay?  And now who\\'s going to decide that? A  bankruptcy judge? No. An ordinary judge in a case\\n \\n  brought in an ordinary court where, in fact, if one side  wins, they get a thousand dollars per instance plus  attorney\\'s fees, plus costs. Now, I thought the point  of the Bankruptcy Code was to have bankruptcy matters  decided in a bankruptcy court and not in an ordinary  Article III court. So how do you reconcile what you are  arguing with the basic point of bankruptcy?</p><p> Really? Really. How  interesting. Then what do they argue about? In - in -- I mean, are there cases in bankruptcy court where  one side says, I have a legitimate dispute and the other  side says, no, you don\\'t? Is that unheard of in  bankruptcy court?</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> But regardless of that  dispute.</p><p> Is -- is -- is the\\n \\n\\n automatic stay applied to these actions or not?\\n\\n57</p><p> So -- so they can\\'t proceed\\n\\n in the -- the -- under the ^ cap? debt act until the\\n\\n bankruptcy is over.</p><p> Okay.</p><p> Well, in Chapter  I\\'m not  sure they did -</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Do you place any weight  on this Fair Debt Collection Act being limited to  particular kinds of creditors; that is, this is not for  your everyday creditor. It is only for these debt  collectors.</p><p> In the ordinary civil\\n\\n litigation, the defendant can always consent to personal\\n\\n jurisdiction. So it's -- it's --</p><p> We are talking about the\\n\\n effect of the FDCPA. And isn't it so that there would\\n\\n be no point in making a claim for a debt that's clearly\\n\\n time barred. No point in doing that except for the\\n\\n chance that it will be overlooked, that it will be\\n\\n skipped. And that you will get paid on the assumption\\n\\n that it's a good claim when, in fact, it isn't.</p><p> But why would need -- if\\n\\n a claim is time barred, you don't need a fresh start to\\n\\n get rid of that claim.

You don't need a discharge in\\n\\n bankruptcy to accomplish that.</p><p> Under the Fair Debt  Collection Practices Act, suppose there were a suit\\n \\n\\n brought in court to collect on a debt that is\\n\\n\\n\\n time-barred. Would that violate the Fair Credit law if\\n\\n you sued in court on a debt that was time-barred?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>But I -- but I -- the  understanding here is that this case involves not claims  which maybe they're barred by the statute of limitations  and maybe they're not, but the issue, as presented to  us, is as to claims where everybody knows, including the  person who's filing the proof of claim, that they're  barred by the statute of limitations.  And what sense could it make for Congress to  think, oh, that's a great idea for some -- for people  just to file those claims and -- and, you know, the - on the -- on -- the best thing that can happen is that  those claims will be filtered out, and the worst thing  that can happen is that they won't be. People will make  mistakes and people will pay on things that they  shouldn't be paying on.</p><p> Before you get to that  language, Mr. Shanmugam. Could you just -- you know,  just from a commonsense basis, it seems hard to  understand why Congress would want all these  unenforceable proofs of claim to flow in, because only  two things can happen. One is that the trustee will  properly filter out those claims; and the other is that  the trustee will be swamped and won't have the time or  the energy or the inclination or he'll make mistakes,  and some of those claims will be deemed enforceable  when, in fact, they're not.  So why would anybody want these proofs of  claim to flood into the bankruptcy system?</p><p> Let's suppose that you are\\n\\n right, that the Code allows this. I mean, it's hard for\\n\\n me to believe that the Code actively invites it, but\\n\\n let's suppose, as it's written, allows that. So then\\n\\n you wouldn't violate the Code by filing these proofs of\\n\\n claim. That's -- that's for sure. But why would that\\n\\n \\n  also absolve you from liability under other statutes?  The codes does not obligate this. You don't have to do  this under the Code. It's a choice. And then another  statute can come along and say, you know what, for  certain actors, for certain creditors, for these debt  collectors, there's an independent rule and the Code  says nothing about that.</p><p> Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry.</p><p> Is your argument --</p><p> -- dependent on a view of\\n\\n the code that precludes these kinds of claims?</p><p> So if -- if one looked at  the code and said, well, it seems as though these kinds  of claims, although unenforceable, can be filed, if that  was your view of the code, what do you think follows  from that?</p><p> So what are the other\\n\\n affirmative defenses that your argument might apply to?</p><p> Are there any affirmative  defenses that your argument might apply to that are  bankruptcy-related particularly? Or are these all kind  of the sort of defenses that are involved in any suit?</p><p> Right. I was asking, are  any of those defenses only bankruptcy related? Do some  of them only arise in a bankruptcy proceeding?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>And that's the trouble I'm  having in this case.</p><p> But if -- if the States  were so worried about that, why don't all States do what  apparently two States do? They say if the statute of  limitation runs, the debt is barred forever. But,  apparently, many States don't say that. They say you  can still sue.</p><p> If the defense isn't  raised as an affirmative defense, as a matter of  pleading I assume in some jurisdictions, and it goes to  trial and you say, oh, judge, this is time barred, the  judge will say, too late, you didn't raise the defense.</p><p> They may -- may not be  raised?</p><p> Well, let -- let me -- let\\n\\n me ask this. In -- in State courts generally, my\\n\\n understanding is that there is a debt; it is just not\\n\\n enforceable.\\n\\n \\n32  Forget bankruptcy. A civil practitioner  represents the creditors. They know the debt is time  barred. Is it unethical to sue because -- on -- on the  theory that the defense may not be waived?</p><p> In other words, if the\\n\\n debt is discharged, then the debtor doesn't have to\\n\\n worry about some claim that he had waived the statute of\\n\\n limitations.</p><p> It would also foreclose\\n\\n the possibility of the creditor arguing that there had\\n\\n been a waiver.</p><p> As a routine matter,\\n\\n does -- does the discharge extinguish that claim?</p><p> Is part of that -- help\\n\\n me, it's on basic bankruptcy law.

As to Clause  (iv), I\\'m not sure I understood what you said. So let\\'s\\n \\n  say your company is owed a debt by other -- to -- other  people owe the company a debt. They get a loan. They  give the -- the party extending the loan a security  interest in that debt, and now there\\'s an effort to  collect that debt.  Who is owed that debt? Is not -- is it not  still owed to the -- the original party? It\\'s not owed  to the person with the security interest, is it?</p><p> Yes. Right.</p><p> Well, this situation -- I --\\n\\n I mean, it\\'s possible to think of situations that would\\n\\n fall within that. It may be that they are not things\\n\\n that are -- they are not situations that are very likely\\n\\n to come up in -- in the real world.\\n\\n But the strength of your -- the -- the\\n\\n degree of absurdity that you have to show under (iv),\\n\\n depends on the ambiguity of the phrase due -- \"owed or\\n\\n due,\" and I mean, I think that\\'s not just -- not the\\n\\n \\n  first way you\\'d read that. It\\'s not the fiftieth way  you would read that. It\\'s just you\\'re -- you\\'re  fighting -- you\\'re really going uphill on that. You  need something really strong to overcome that, I would  say.</p><p> Why would they not be\\n\\n covered if they acquired the debt before it went into --\\n\\n I\\'m sorry -- after it went into default? They would be\\n\\n collecting a debt owed -- owed or due to someone else.\\n\\n And they acquired the debt after it went into default;\\n\\n therefore, they don\\'t fall into (iii).</p><p> And I don\\'t see a problem\\n\\n with -- with (F)(iii). The -- the party is attempting\\n\\n to collect a debt owed or due to someone else, and it\\n\\n concerns a debt which was obtained. And -- and if\\n\\n obtained, it doesn\\'t mean owed. You can obtain a debt\\n\\n \\n\\n that you don\\'t own. I don\\'t see any problem with\\n\\n\\n\\n (F)(iii).</p><p> Why do you have to get into  assignments at all? All -- all that\\'s needed to defeat  your argument with respect to (iii), is to think of a  situation in which a person or an entity is collecting a  debt owed to another, and that person or entity obtained  the debt at a time when the debt was not defaulted. And  that -- it\\'s very easy to think of a situation like  that, with respect to the classic debt collector that\\n \\n\\n does nothing but collect other people\\'s debts, if\\n\\n\\n\\n \"obtained\" means getting that debt for collection.</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>Am I right about what you\\n\\n think his reply is?</p><p> Where -- where do they say\\n\\n that?</p><p> Yeah. The (iv) is\\n\\n Mr. Smith owes some money to a Company Jones, and\\n\\n Company Jones assigns the debt to a servicing company,\\n\\n all right? And so the servicing company might have --\\n\\n be -- it might be said, you can use it this way. They\\n\\n obtained the debt from Company Jones.\\n\\n And so somebody might say that this assignee\\n\\n is collecting a debt from Smith, that Smith owes\\n\\n another, namely Jones. But we don\\'t want to cover them\\n\\n in this statute. We don\\'t want to cover that kind of\\n\\n debt collector. So they write (iv).\\n\\n And the same is true of (iii). They write\\n\\n (iii) because they don\\'t want mortgage -- mortgage\\n\\n servicers to be falling within the statute, unless, of\\n\\n course, the mortgage servicer is serving a dead\\n\\n mortgage. Then why shouldn\\'t they? All right? Now,\\n\\n that reasoning doesn\\'t seem, to me, illogical.\\n\\n On the other hand, if we take your\\n\\n reasoning, you have to interpret this is, so I was\\n\\n thinking of examples. And I thought, well, what about\\n\\n \\n\\n one of these companies that goes and buys up other\\n\\n\\n\\n companies, turns them around, and sells them. When they\\n\\n buy a company, they buy the -- the receivables. And\\n\\n while they own the company, they\\'re going to collect the\\n\\n receivables. And so there they are. You see? On your\\n\\n definition, those receivables were once owed the company\\n\\n that they\\'re bought. So on your definition, that whole\\n\\n category of people falls within the definition.\\n\\n So it seems to me, although you point to\\n\\n problems, they are not insuperable problems with the\\n\\n word \"obtained.\" Or if I accept your definition of\\n\\n \"is,\" I get into a lot of difficulties. Now, that --\\n\\n that was where -- I\\'m not saying that\\'s my final view of\\n\\n this. I\\'m just saying, how do you respond?</p><p> I think -- I might not have  this right, but I think that they\\'re replying to that is  what happens in the situation that you mentioned is that  the initial creditor who sold the car or whatever, and  they\\'re going to give as collateral that. They get - the -- the person who takes the collateral, say  Santander, takes an assignment of the debt.  And they\\'re saying taking an assignment of  the debt, once that happens, it isn\\'t true that the car  buyer owes anything to the car dealer. But if I\\'ve got  it right -- good bet, maybe, maybe not -- but if it\\'s - if it\\'s true -- that\\'s true, then he is not collecting\\n \\n\\n the debt for another.\\n\\n33</p><p> But now, so where did this\\n\\n come from that we\\'re only talking about assignees? And\\n\\n \\n  it\\'s important. For if we\\'re not always talking about  assignees, but only some of the time, you can\\'t raise  your objection except to a subset of the section (iv)  people. And as -- if you were talking about a subset,  assuming you\\'re right, no one writes statutes perfectly.  You\\'ll always under-include or over-include.</p><p> That\\'s true about -- I take\\n\\n your -- I understand your point on assignees, I think.\\n\\n Now, look at (iv).

JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ\\n\\n ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p><p> Why is it that  whether it's authorized or not, you don't think it's  going to prompt violence? The fact that you have a  search warrant, you may have a search warrant, say, I've  got to execute a search warrant to pick up this armed  and dangerous felon; you may still think that's going to  prompt violence. That doesn't have anything to do with  the nature of the entry you're going to have to make  later on. Knock-and-announce does, because if you just  burst in, the person may reasonably think this is a  burglar. But if you knock and announce, it doesn't.  That does affect the -- the -- the nature of -- of the  conduct. But I think a warrant, whether it's authorized  or not, doesn't.</p><p> Exactly. So I don't  know why the failure to get a warrant matters.</p><p> Right.</p><p> But I guess maybe I  just -- you -- you -- as I understand your theory, the  failure to get a warrant caused -- that's why we call it  a provocation, I guess -- caused the -- the entry which  caused the -- the confrontation; is that right?</p><p> Well, I'm asking the  same thing over and over again.</p><p> Okay.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>\"You know, I know -- I know  you\\'re a police officer, but I don\\'t think you really  have an exception to the warrant requirement, so I\\'m  going to shoot you.\"  They can\\'t do that, can they?</p><p> It\\'s not justified for them  to attack the police. They -- \"Well, I know\" --\\n \\n46</p><p> Yeah. And in my  hypothetical, the -- what I -- I neglected to say but  should have said was that there weren\\'t exigent  circumstances. So the -- the entry was unlawful, but  they had a warrant -- they -- they -- but you still have  those two situations. In one case, they have a warrant.  The other case, they say: We think -- and they turn out  to be wrong -- that we don\\'t need a warrant.  But I don\\'t -- I asked you whether there\\'s a  greater risk of violence in one than the other, and I - I\\'d like to hear your -- your answer. Why would there  be a greater risk of violence in the situation where  the -- the resident knows that it\\'s -- that they are  police officers and they\\'re going to conduct a search,  as opposed to the situation where there\\'s -- where  there\\'s a warrant? Any -- any violence that the  resident directs at the police officer is illegal in  both situations; right?</p><p> So -</p><p> But the Fourth Amendment\\n\\n doesn\\'t prohibit unreasonable interactions. What it\\n\\n prohibits is unreasonable searches and seizures. So\\n\\n it\\'s entirely appropriate to look at the whole seizure,\\n\\n but not this chain of interactions that includes a lot\\n\\n of things that happened before there ever is conduct\\n\\n that implicates the Fourth Amendment.</p><p> And that would be the\\n\\n situation in the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor\\n\\n mentioned, which was presented in your brief, where the\\n\\n police officer jumps in front of a car and doesn\\'t allow\\n\\n the driver enough time to stop. And then as the driver\\n\\n is approaching the police officer, the police officer\\n\\n shoots. That\\'s a seizure. And so you look at the\\n\\n entire seizure, the jumping in front of the car, plus\\n\\n the ultimate shooting to determine whether it\\'s\\n\\n reasonable.</p><p> Well, it may very well be a\\n\\n seizure. If they -- if they interfere with the liberty\\n\\n of the person who they approach, then it\\'s a -- then\\n\\n it\\'s a seizure, it\\'s a stop.</p><p> Well, but that\\'s a different  way of looking at the situation. And I agree, that  that\\'s a -- you know, that\\'s -- that\\'s the question that  you would think you would address under the Fourth  Amendment. You start out with the Fourth Amendment  violation, and then you say, did it proximately cause  the use of deadly force? But not the rule that you  suggested where you start out with something that isn\\'t  a violation of the Fourth Amendment, whether or not it  represents best police practices or not.</p><p> Isn\\'t -- if, in\\n\\n Justice Kennedy\\'s hypothetical that there had been an\\n\\n application for a warrant, isn\\'t it entirely possible,\\n\\n particularly under the facts that he hypothesized, that\\n\\n the judge would say you don\\'t need an arrest warrant in\\n\\n this situation? You can ask the defendant\\'s attorney to\\n\\n bring the defendant in and surrender. I know that\\n\\n that\\'s happened quite a few times.</p><p> Can I ask a follow-up\\n\\n question on that?</p><p> That\\'s -- that was a\\n\\n different context. It had to do with an exception to\\n\\n the warrant requirement. But the problem with your\\n\\n test, as you articulate it, and as I understand it, is\\n\\n \\n\\n that you start out with something that is said to be\\n\\n32\\n\\n unreasonable, but it is not a violation of the Fourth\\n\\n Amendment. And you impose liability for that decision,\\n\\n not for the ultimate decision to use deadly force.\\n\\n And -- and this has come up in a situation\\n\\n like Sheehan where there\\'s a dispute about whether it\\'s\\n\\n reasonable for -- you have a -- a mentally disturbed\\n\\n person and let\\'s say the person has a hostage in a house\\n\\n or there\\'s an innocent person there and the mentally\\n\\n disturbed person is acting in a way that seems to\\n\\n present a serious threat to the -- the innocent person\\n\\n in the house. And there\\'s a dispute about whether it\\'s\\n\\n reasonable for the police to enter as opposed to waiting\\n\\n for a -- a psychological expert or -- or they only have\\n\\n negotiations for a short period of time before they\\n\\n enter and it\\'s argued that wasn\\'t reasonable, that\\'s not\\n\\n good police practice, they should have waited a longer\\n\\n period of time, and you end up imposing liability.\\n\\n And then once they go in, then they\\'re in\\n\\n a -- in a life-threatening situation and they use force.\\n\\n You end up imposing liability for what is arguably a\\n\\n violation of best police practices, or something that is\\n\\n recommended by experts in this situation. That\\'s what\\'s\\n\\n anomalous about the rule that you\\'ve -- that you\\'ve\\n\\n suggested.\\n\\n \\n33</p><p> Well, then, then I don\\'t see  where there\\'s proximate cause.</p><p> Well, let me give you two\\n\\n situations.\\n\\n Situation A: The officers get a warrant,\\n\\n they go to the residence, they knock on the door. The\\n\\n resident opens the door. They say: We have a search\\n\\n warrant. We\\'re going to search your house.\\n\\n All right?\\n\\n Situation B: They don\\'t get a search\\n\\n warrant. They think they have exigent circumstances.\\n\\n They knock on the door. And they -- in both cases,\\n\\n they\\'re uniformed police officers. They say: We\\'re\\n\\n police officers. We\\'re here; we\\'re going to search your\\n\\n house. We don\\'t have a warrant. We think we have -- we\\n\\n can search your house without a warrant because we have\\n\\n an exception to the warrant requirement.\\n\\n Now, is there more -- is it more likely that\\n\\n there\\'s going to be violence in the second situation\\n\\n than in the first situation? I -- I -- I don\\'t see why\\n\\n there is.</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>So how? How is that? That\\n\\n is, what I think the argument on the other side is in\\n\\n response, I was looking saying look holistically. The\\n\\n seizure is the shooting and his -- and his injury, okay?</p><p> Save your rebuttal.</p><p> I mean, if you break it  down temporally, second by second. But if you look at  the whole situation?</p><p> If you look at the whole  situation and say, you know what this is like? It's  like the classic tort case. Somebody pushes somebody  else into the street where he is run down by a negligent  driver. Is the individual -- there's a supervening  cause, negligent driver. Of course they're liable,  because that's what happens. You expect negligent  drivers, and similarly, you expect people to defend  themselves.  That's a -- why -- why -- what's wrong with  that?</p><p> Why -- why -- why not just\\n\\n say, look, there was a seizure. It killed him or\\n\\n wounded him. It's a seizure. In fact, the question is,\\n\\n was that seizure -- i.e., shooting him -- was that\\n\\n seizure unreasonable and clearly unreasonable? And the\\n\\n answer to yes is, yeah, look at all the circumstances.\\n\\n \\n  There's one, they went into the house  without even telling the woman. Then they break into - they go into the other house without a warrant, without  telling anybody. I'm -- I'm not saying that those are  independently violations of the Constitution, though  they might be.</p><p> Why -- why do you break --\\n\\n why is everyone breaking it down in this way? That's\\n\\n what I'm having trouble with.</p><p> The question is, would any\\n\\n reasonable person think that that was unreasonable?\\n\\n Now, we break it down. Not unreasonable to\\n\\n the shoot in the situation. That wasn't unreasonable.\\n\\n Seems, too, they -- they say not unconstitutional or\\n\\n unreasonably wrong not to knock and announce, because\\n\\n that's what the Ninth Circuit found, and the part that\\n\\n was wrong, not getting a warrant, made no difference.\\n\\n So they're saying zero plus zero plus zero, it must\\n\\n equal zero. Okay? That, I think, is the argument I'm\\n\\n trying to -- to put that I -- that I want to hear the\\n\\n answer to.</p><p> That's, I think, what your\\n\\n argument is in respect to the warrant, if not the knock\\n\\n \\n49  and announce, you can't deal with that anymore. So it's  the whole ball of wax which has less justification, and  it is clear that the action from A to Z is what caused  the death. Now, would -- you haven't really strongly  argued that, so I'm a little hesitant to bring it up.</p><p> What -- just thinking, you\\n\\n know, we want policemen to protect themselves. They\\n\\n have to. Of course they do. But there can be\\n\\n circumstances where, of course, that's true that they\\n\\n have a right to protect themselves, but the background\\n\\n circumstances are such that there's no justification for\\n\\n the whole ball of wax.</p><p> Because?</p><p> And don't answer it if it's\\n\\n a red herring. But, look, everybody is talking about\\n\\n causation. Maybe this isn't about causation. Perhaps\\n\\n it's about whether a reasonable person -- namely, a\\n\\n reasonable policeman -- namely, any reasonable\\n\\n policeman -- would know in the circumstances that what\\n\\n he was doing was unconstitutional. What was he doing?\\n\\n Shooting someone.\\n\\n Why would he know it was unconstitutional?\\n\\n Well, here in ordinary tort law, Case , the trespasser\\n\\n reasonably believes, but wrongly believes, that he is an\\n\\n \\n\\n invited guest.\\n\\n48\\n\\n Case : He knows he's a trespasser. Okay?\\n\\n Does that make a difference to the result?</p><p> But -- but here, wait,\\n\\n wait. Ordinary tort law, let's pick up on this for a\\n\\n second.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>He didn't have the\\n\\n technicality about the knock and announce. Let's assume\\n\\n that this was a separate house, so it -- it required a\\n\\n knock and announce. There's nothing about the closure\\n\\n or any -- then -- then would you recognize that they had\\n\\n a good 1983 case?</p><p> Is it much better or\\n\\n would they -- would they have --</p><p> Can -- can you tell me if  Paula Jones on your theory -- Paula Hughes -- Paula  Hughes, the homeowner, who was -- there was no warrant  and she was placed in a car and treated rather badly,  would she have a 1983 claim?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.</p><p> And this is qualified  immunity context; everything has to be a violation of  clearly established law, quite right.  So I guess the question is, why is this case  any different? In other words, this case you don\\'t have  the knock-and-announce violation; you have a different  constitutional violation, which is an unauthorized  entry. And why would it not be the case that the - that the death or injury in such a case is also  proximately caused by that violation?  In other words, proximate cause says what  kind of things are foreseeable, and it says -- it sets  an outer bound, and it says totally flukey, random  things we\\'re not going to say are proximately caused.  But it doesn\\'t seem to me a flukey or random thing to  say when there is an authorized entry into somebody\\'s  home, violence may well result. And so the proximate  cause analysis seems to flow in much the same way, maybe  not to quite the same -- like with -- quite the same  obviousness, but in much the same way as in your  knock-and-announce example.</p><p> It\\'s -- it\\'s a simple  question, Mr. Rosenkranz.</p><p> You said something about  knock and announce. I say why isn\\'t the same theory  applicable when the constitutional violation is  unauthorized entry into somebody\\'s home?</p><p> That is an unauthorized  entry into somebody\\'s home.</p><p> Can I --</p><p> Can I ask about the first\\n\\n theory, because you said if there was a violation --\\n\\n excuse me -- of the knock-and-announce rule, and a death\\n\\n or an injury proximately caused by that violation, then\\n\\n there could be recovery.\\n\\n Is that what you said?</p><p> Yes.</p><p> So that is the clearly  established constitutional violation.</p><p> But one of -- a warrant\\n\\n violation is just -- it\\'s -- it\\'s just saying\\n\\n unauthorized entry. And the question is whether it\\'s\\n\\n within the normal scope of the risk, but an unauthorized\\n\\n entry produces violence, not that it always or probably\\n\\n produces violence, but that it might produce violence in\\n\\n the way we kind of ask when we do proximate cause\\n\\n analysis.</p><p> So that seems fair enough.\\n\\n But then the question might become, whether here or on\\n\\n remand, whether an unauthorized entry, where there was a\\n\\n clearly established violation, whether one could say\\n\\n that that was the proximate cause of the shooting.</p><p> -- before -- can I just - do you agree in general, before you address the question  in particular, do you agree in general what that  framing -- that if there is an independent  constitutional violation and if it does proximately  cause the injury, then there\\'s a 1983 action?</p><p> Do you -</p><p> But it might very well  change -</p><p> It might very well change  the outcome. When somebody shows up with a warrant,  they show it -- they show the warrant, they have legal  authority, people act very differently than when  somebody shows up with no warrant and says, I don\\'t have  authority. I\\'m coming in anyway. That\\'s a very  different set of circumstances that a homeowner has to  respond to.  And what is for -- what foreseeably happens  where there is a warrant is not the same thing. When  somebody -- when a police officer has legal authority,  tells the homeowner he has legal authority, the set of  results that happens is just not the same as when a  police officer just says, \"I\\'m here, I don\\'t have any  legal authority, I\\'m coming in anyway\".</p><p> Well, it\\'s -- it\\'s possible.  I mean, I take the point, Mr. Rosenkranz, it\\'s possible  that you have a warrant in your pocket and you don\\'t say  anything about it, although that would seem like very  silly -- stupid police work. But the prototypical case  when somebody has a warrant is that they tell a  homeowner they have a warrant and that they have a right  to be on the premises. That\\'s what usually happens.  And similarly, what often happens is that  when somebody doesn\\'t say that to a homeowner, they are  making it far more likely that violence will ensue. And  certainly the kind of violence that could ensue is not  the kind of flukey, random stuff that is filtered out by  a proximate cause inquiry.</p><p> Doesn\\'t have to, normally.\\n\\n It doesn\\'t have to --</p><p> Or -- you know, proximate  cause is just we filter out the really fluky stuff.</p><p> Why isn\\'t the proximate  cause -- why it -- why wouldn\\'t it be that a death or\\n \\n  injury that results when somebody barges into, goes into  somebody\\'s home without legal authorization, that one of  the things that foreseeably can result from that is a  shooting?</p><p> -- proximate cause -- the - the proximate results of each of those two different  kinds of entry are very different.</p><p> Well, can I suggest why it  might matter? I mean, there are two kinds of entry:  One is -- let\\'s -- for these purposes, one is an  authorized entry and one is an unauthorized entry.  Now the question is, what kind of conduct  does each of those kinds of entries provoke? If you\\'re  an authorized entry, you don\\'t really think that it\\'s  going to provoke violence. But if you\\'re an\\n \\n42  unauthorized entry, you do think it\\'s going to provoke  violence. So the -</p><p> Can I say this -</p><p> So it\\'s not just an entry.  The question is, who\\'s entering: a trespasser or a\\n \\n\\n guest?\\n\\n47</p><p> -- than when a guest enters  your home.</p><p> And when a trespasser enters  your home, different sets of things foreseeably  happen -</p><p> A guest entrant, let\\'s call  the person; right?</p><p> Mr. Feldman, you said there  are two kinds of entrance; right? One is a trespasser  entrant, and one is a nontrespasser entrant.</p><p> I guess I\\'m not\\n\\n \\n39  understanding, Mr. Feldman, why you\\'re quite making this  distinction. I mean, it -- it -- why isn\\'t it just,  look, the entry without authority, the entry without a  warrant, that\\'s a clear but-for cause of the shooting?  The shooting wouldn\\'t have happened if there hadn\\'t been  the entry; right?</p><p> Now the question is, is it a  but -- is it a proximate cause of the inquiry? And  it -- and it seems to me that you have to make a case - and tell me if you agree or don\\'t agree: You have to  make a case that unauthorized entry, that one of the - one of the things that foreseeably can happen with an  unauthorized entry is that the person whose home it is  will react with violence.</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': '<p>You -- you -- my  understanding of your argument is you have not -- that  you are defending the Ninth Circuit\\'s holding that  because the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by  searching the house without a warrant, that was the  proximate cause, you\\'re defending that.</p><p> I -- I think that\\'s a\\n \\n\\n difficult position to defend.\\n\\n53</p><p> Well, I -- I think that\\'s\\n\\n the correct way to argue the case, and based on that,\\n\\n then we can have our discussion as to whether or not\\n\\n it -- the -- it was indeed proximate.</p><p> Well, why wasn\\'t there - what was the super -- why wasn\\'t there superseding cause  here after the failure to get the warrant?</p><p> And if the humiliation is\\n\\n the same either way, no damage?</p><p> Are you defending the  Ninth Circuit\\'s statement at page 22A of the Petition  Appendix? \"Here the District Court held that, because  the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by searching  the shack without a warrant, which proximately caused  the plaintiff\\'s injuries, liability was proper.\"</p><p> -- proximate -- proximate.</p><p> Now, let\\'s assume that it  wouldn\\'t.

Under your view, we\\'re\\n\\n saying that you cannot sue for damages and humiliation\\n\\n if there\\'s an entry without a warrant if there had been\\n\\n probable cause otherwise. That\\'s -- that\\'s the rule you\\n\\n want us to announce.</p><p> You want us -- you want us\\n\\n to write that in the law.</p><p> Then -- then we simply  have no way to enforce the warrant requirement. So - so you stand by the proposition that if there is an  unlawful entry, an unlawful arrest because of a lack of\\n \\n\\n a warrant, no damage because the arrest would have\\n\\n\\n\\n happened with -- with the warrant anyway.</p><p> Suppose this case, police  arrest without a warrant a man who\\'s having dinner with  his family and friends, white collar crime. They did  not get a warrant. They did have probable cause. They  could have gotten a warrant. And he sues -- and later  the charges are dismissed, it was a mistake, but there  was still probable cause. And he sues for fright and  humiliation. Under your theory, you\\'d say, well, even  if he got a warrant, he\\'d have the same fright and  humiliation, so there\\'s -- there\\'s no damage.</p><p> Well suppose -</p><p> I -- I just don\\'t see the  proximate cause between failure to get the warrant and  what happened here.</p>', 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>You're making a  presumption there that I think you have to address,  which is, yes, they entered without a warrant. You're  assuming it's unconstitutional. No one's addressed it,  and I don't think the Court did below, whether that  entry had an exception for unconstitutionality. Was it  an exigent circumstance or not?  You're assuming that they didn't have a  legal motive for entry. I'm willing to start with that  assumption, but let's assume that a court below could  say that the entry was lawful because it was pursuant to  exigent circumstances.  What would happen to your argument then?</p><p> So we're assuming that  the entry was unlawful. There were no exceptions to it  in this case.</p><p> Let's go to that\\n \\n51  superseding cause document. Earlier you said to Justice  Alito that if a police officer unlawfully enters your  home, announces him or herself, shows you a badge, and  you pull out a gun and point it at him or her, that that  officer would not be liable for shooting you because,  presumably, that person, knowing that you're a police  officer, if they pull a gun on you, they are responsible  for the consequences, correct?</p><p> All right. So what's  the difference between that scenario and this one? Why  aren't -- why isn't Mr. Mendez's -- I don't think  there's a dispute that he was moving the gun not because  he heard the police officers, but he just wanted to get  it out of the way -- that there was no intent on his  part? What -- why isn't it just like the other person  who points the gun at someone?</p><p> This is standard tort  law, right?</p><p> Wait a minute. This\\n\\n wasn't in the middle of the day.</p><p> p.m. in the afternoon?</p><p> Can you repeat that\\n\\n standard?</p><p> -- for a police officer\\n\\n to pull a gun and shoot a driver that has no guilt\\n\\n associated with him or her? Not an armed felon, just a\\n\\n normal person to stumble into the street and say, I'm a\\n\\n police officer, I'm going to seize that person and stop\\n\\n myself by being injured by shooting that person?</p><p> I'm sorry. Go ahead.</p><p> That's where I have -- '</p><p> Well, let's -- let's  break that down, because I see two scenarios in this for  which a victim could -- could recover.  One is an unconstitutional violation that  proximately causes an injury. Okay? That's the theory  you come to. And the second is, if there was an  unreasonable use of force by the police officer. You're  taking out of the equation the second way of -- of  recovering?</p><p> Or -- or was justified  in whatever he or she did to protect themselves.  So let's take the situation, which I think  you concede in your brief, that of the police officer  who, in the dead of night, in -- dressed in casual  clothes, breaks a window in someone's home and walks  into their home.  And we have given them the Second Amendment  right to victims, people who own homes, to possess  firearms to protect themselves. And the victim sees a  stranger breaking in who doesn't announce themselves,  doesn't have a uniform, and is standing there breaking  in. The victim shoots that police officer, or points a  gun at that police officer, and the police officer takes  a gun and shoots them and injures them or kills them.  Now who bears the financial loss in that  situation? The homeowner, who has a right to defend him  or herself and say it's my life or yours, or the police  officer who has taken unreasonable action in breaking  into a home in the middle of the night without\\n \\n  announcing him or herself? That's the question for me.</p><p> So is it --</p><p> -- how they do their\\n\\n job, because they have to know -- they have to know what\\n\\n reasonable people will do. I mean, if -- if a 1983\\n\\n claim is a tort claim, and if they jump in front of a\\n\\n car, of a total stranger on the street, and the person\\n\\n is coming at them, should that person behind the wheel\\n\\n bear the brunt of an injury because the police officer\\n\\n says the car was coming towards me, so to save myself, I\\n\\n pulled the gun and shot them, even though this is Joe\\n\\n Blow who's never been arrested, doesn't own a gun, never\\n\\n knew the officer had jumped into the street? If a\\n\\n normal person did that, they'd pay for that victim's\\n\\n injury. Why does a police officer get a pass on that?</p><p> But why isn't --</p><p> So, why is it that every\\n\\n Graham case we look at, all the car chase cases, every\\n\\n single one of them, we -- when we're talking about the\\n\\n situation facing the officer, we look at everything the\\n\\n officer and the victim did that led up to the moment of\\n\\n confrontation. Because all of the facts that you point\\n\\n \\n  to as the police officer's knowledge of the victim are  facts that usually are intertwined with what led up to  the incident.  So if you look at a car chase, you're  looking at a person who, over an extended period of  time has driven a car crazily, has put other people at  risk, has swerved and missed other cars, done a series  of things that the officer is aware of because he  participated in the chase, and at the moment that he is  looking at what the victim -- what the defendant is  doing, he's saying he drove the car and almost hit  another car, he's pointing the car at me, he's going to  hit me.  And -- but you're looking at both sides of  that equation. You're not ratcheting it up on one side</p><p> You know, I have a -- it  is a very moving statement, and one that I totally agree  with, but we're not asking the police officers to make  that choice. When they feel in danger, they are going  to take the step that's important to them, and I think  that's absolutely right.  The issue is who's going to suffer that  loss? Who's going to take the financial penalty of that  loss, not that that's the -- the death of the officer.\\n \\n  And so the question to me is not that one. The question  is when does the police officer pay the victim who is  suffering for that loss if the victim had nothing to do  with causing the loss?</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n The case is submitted.\\n\\n (Whereupon, at :59 p.m., the case in the\\n\\n above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> Thank you, counsel.

(Laughter.)</p><p> Why?</p><p> And we need tolling in  order to stop that.</p><p> If we take your second  theory, we have to read the words \"be brought\" to mean  something like deemed to have been brought when, but - something like that -- but that won\\'t solve the  practical problem you raised, because there will still  be cases in which class certification is denied after  three years, and all these practical problems will then  exist, won\\'t they?</p><p> But you need tolling.

Why?</p><p> What will happen, what  you -- what you have to do to get to his -- I agree - to get to his result, I agree with you this far. You  have to read those words, \"any action be brought.\" And  what they mean is the action was brought. It was  brought when they filed the class action. Whether it  denied class certification or not, that\\'s when it was  brought. And this is the same action. It is not a  different action. It is the same action. It is the  same action because, one, the same words, because, you  know, we go through a list, and moreover brought within  a reasonable time.  Why interpret those words in the way I just  said? The reason why is because it is the same action.  The other reason why is because you will, even if not so  far, discover that people do want to protect themselves\\n \\n\\n and will do so. Whether they are big or small, they\\n\\n45\\n\\n will.

In terms of accessibility of the statute,  and simplicity, it would seem wiser to prevent that type  of, you know, splitting the -- well, whatever.</p><p> You have two cases\\n\\n here, and one was come together, and the one they say,\\n\\n no, no, that\\'s got to go to the MSPB and the -- I mean,\\n\\n that\\'s got to go to the Federal Circuit because we need\\n\\n uniformity are the cases where they don\\'t think there is\\n\\n a claim under the Civil Service Act.</p><p> But where is the\\n\\n other detour? I thought the other route was straight to\\n\\n the district court.</p><p> You said there has\\n\\n to be a detour either way. I understand there\\'s a\\n\\n detour in the MSPB to the Federal Circuit under your\\n\\n view.</p><p> Right.</p><p> So under your  theory, the problem is that if you don\\'t go to the MS - if you don\\'t go to the Federal Circuit, the district  court, it will all get mucked up in the CSRA business  because they can\\'t go ahead and decide it, you have to  wait, and it has to go back later because of Chenery  issues and the like.  And the other side is, well, if -- if you go  to the -- if you have to go your route, it\\'s the  discrimination claim that gets all mucked up, because it  may have -- you may need to toll the complaints, the  exhaustion issue may be complicated. So it\\'s a problem  either way, right?</p><p> By -- by the tolling  and allowing them to start over again?</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Landau, four minutes.  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  The case is submitted.  (Whereupon, at :01 a.m., the case in the  above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> It is odd, though.\\n\\n It is odd that the only category of cases that you say\\n\\n has to go to the Federal Circuit through the MSPB are\\n\\n the cases in which the MSPB thinks they don\\'t have\\n\\n jurisdiction.</p><p> Now, before you can  do that, you have to exhaust; right?</p><p> -- and then you can\\n\\n go either to the district court or to the MSPB.</p><p> Go ahead.</p><p> But that\\'s the  way -- that\\'s the way the system works, generally. I  mean, there are all sorts of statutory programs where  there are prerequisites to a proceeding. You know, the  Clean Water Act, you know, you can only proceed if  they -- the company is discharging water into navigable  waters, but the system always works by the fact -- it\\n \\n\\n has to start with an allegation.\\n\\n33\\n\\n That\\'s the -- you know, the -- the one\\n\\n provision does say \"alleges\" and the other doesn\\'t, but\\n\\n it\\'s hard to see how -- the -- the system doesn\\'t turn\\n\\n on preexisting facts. The way it -- you answer facts is\\n\\n you have an allegation, and then you have a response and\\n\\n all that.\\n\\n So I don\\'t think the fact that it -- A did\\n\\n not use the word \"alleges\" can really be that\\n\\n significant.</p><p> Mr. Fletcher.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</p><p> Thank you, counsel.</p><p> But that -- that --\\n\\n that takes place -- I just want to make sure I\\'ve got\\n\\n the flow here right. That takes place before you get to\\n\\n that fork in the road; right? If this -- this is a\\n\\n mixed case in which you file your complaint with the\\n\\n agency --</p><p> Well, I think -- I\\n\\n think you\\'re right that it -- it\\'s a problem. I\\n\\n just can\\'t figure out who it\\'s a problem for. The --\\n\\n the -- I mean, if you\\'re concerned about the\\n\\n consequences of what the MSPB might do, you can skip it\\n\\n altogether and go -- go to district court right away;\\n\\n right?</p><p> And we\\'ve -- we have  had -- I won\\'t say difficulty, but we\\'ve had a lot of  cases trying to decide whether something is  jurisdictional or procedural. And it\\'s not always an  easy question. And to suggest that people, you know,  filing these things pro se will be able to understand,  well, that\\'s jurisdictional, but it may actually be  jurisdictional in the sense of being a claims processing  rule as opposed to substantive jurisdiction. I -- I  think you\\'re putting a huge burden on the -- on the  system.</p><p> And -- and that - and, normally, that you can appeal that, and -- and have  a choice to seek a review of it. And you\\'re talking  about matters that are, I think in a majority of the  cases, brought pro se.</p><p> Can I -- you could  go to the district court right away simply by skipping  the MSPB; right?</p>', 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>Mr. Fletcher, the -- the one  thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me  is that nobody who is not a lawyer, and no ordinary  lawyer could read these statutes and figure out what  they are supposed to do.  (Laughter.)</p><p> And this isn\\'t -- this isn\\'t  your fault.  Now we\\'ll decide this case, and that will  make things clearer. There still will be all sorts of  questions.  Can\\'t something -- can\\'t something be done about this?  (Laughter.)</p><p> This is a case that\\'s about,  at bottom, not very much substantively, right? No  matter which side wins, Mr. Perry will, in the end, get  a decision if he wants it in the district court on both  of the questions.</p><p> So what can be done to clear  up this? This is unbelievably complicated.</p><p> Who wrote -- who wrote this  statute? Somebody who - (Laughter.)</p><p> -- takes pleasure out of  pulling the wings off flies?  (Laughter.)</p><p> What\\'s -- what\\'s wrong with  it?</p><p> If you had chosen to go  directly to the district court, if you had bypassed the  Merit System Protection Board, would you be able to\\n \\n\\n raise in the district court the question whether the\\n\\n\\n\\n alleged removal was proper under  -- 7513, whether it\\n\\n was -- would promote the efficiency of the service, or\\n\\n would you have at that point only the discrimination\\n\\n claim?</p><p> Can I ask you a question\\n\\n about the language of 7702(a)()(A) and (B), which is\\n\\n the provision that specifies the jurisdiction of the\\n\\n MSPB.\\n\\n So, subparagraph A says: --</p><p> -- \"Has been affected by\\n\\n action.\"</p><p> And subparagraph B says,\\n\\n \"Alleges that a basis for the action.\"\\n\\n \\n  So what should I read into the different language used  in those provisions? The second one, B, certainly  concerns allegations, but it -- A doesn\\'t say alleges  that he has been affected by. It says, has been maybe  affected -- in fact, affected by.</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>Yes.\\n\\n \\n53</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Well, no. I -- no, you're\\n\\n not following me. I think I'm agreeing with you. I'm\\n\\n saying your answer has to be right, because, otherwise,\\n\\n you again get the civil service part -- I mean, the\\n\\n discrimination part done. Then it would be back over at\\n\\n the Board again and it would never end. And this poor\\n\\n employee, who is already hungry and thirsty and been\\n\\n going on for quite a while, would just have another\\n\\n loop-around to go. Am I right?</p><p> Otherwise, you're going to\\n\\n bounce, bounce, bounce.</p><p> -- and in -- in the MSPB.  We then can -- if they kept it for 120 days more, we go  right to the district court. Remember that. Then, by  the way, if they decide against us, we go right to the  district court. Remember that.  Now, in the two cases I said to remember,  when the district court has them, does the district  court decide both the discrimination issue and does it  review the civil service issue?</p><p> So when it goes to the  district court -- well, here, first, you could go to the  district court at the beginning. You can treat it as  discrimination, but then you can't bring the civil  service part.  So now we want to bring both. And we go to  the MSPB. And then we -- okay. Now, again, we -- we  take an appeal and we go -- we have to go to the Federal  Circuit -</p><p> So just as a matter of pure\\n\\n simplicity, if we could get there, why, if they're going\\n\\n to decide in the district court, I guess, under an\\n\\n ordinary AD-law set of standards, they're going to\\n\\n decide in the district court the civil service claim as\\n\\n well, and you will have nonuniformity in a whole bunch\\n\\n of cases where the MPSB decided no, why not bring this\\n\\n one in too? Because this one in too would give you the\\n\\n added uniform -- it -- it -- there's no more\\n\\n disuniformity than there is in any of the other cases.\\n\\n And all that you have here are just what he said on\\n\\n jurisdiction.\\n\\n What this case is really about is whether\\n\\n there was a voluntary departure from the -- from the\\n\\n civil service or whether he was really fired.</p><p> I see where you're going  there. And my question -</p><p> All right. And so  sometimes he does and sometimes he doesn't. Okay.</p><p> Does he get review of the  civil service claim in district court?</p><p> -- and then he goes to  district court.</p><p> Oh, really? Now suppose  they decide it in the MPSB -</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Yeah. I see that.  But it isn't no good reason. The reason is you're  cutting out the extra loop, the very reason that you  have the district court make the AD-law decision in the  cases where the MPSB decided against the employee.  So the reasoning is the same. It is -- it  is, I grant you, that much more, but that much more is  not a distinction of principle.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>So that label,  jurisdictional -- I mean, as I see it, the -- and the  employee says, these adverse actions were taken against  me, I was suspended, and then I was forced into early  retirement. Those are adverse actions.  And then the MSPB said, but you surrendered  those claims. That's ordinarily like a release. It's  like a defense. I don't see how it gets to be  jurisdictional.</p><p> You -- you would have to\\n\\n exhaust before you go to the district court. You\\n\\n couldn't just go from the decision.</p><p> The government -- the\\n\\n government takes the position that it hasn't been in\\n\\n exhaustion as a requirement. You can't get to the\\n\\n district court on a discrimination claim without\\n\\n exhausting your internal remedy.</p><p> But the district court\\n\\n couldn't resolve the case at this point either because\\n\\n the internal revenues weren't exhausted. So if the\\n\\n appealability -- the civil service appealability goes to\\n\\n the district court, then it has to go back to MSPB, and\\n\\n it gets to the district court only if -- if the EEO\\n\\n remedy has been exhausted; isn't that so?</p><p> I don't -- I don't see  the -- the needless frolic. This question of  appealability has to go someplace. You say it goes to  the district court. The other side says it goes to the  Federal Circuit. But in -- in this case, you -- your  discrimination claim is fully protected, isn't it, even  if you have to go to the -- to the Federal Circuit on\\n \\n\\n the civil service claim? You can still go to the\\n\\n\\n\\n district court with your discrimination claim.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': '<p>Keep going. Keep going.</p><p> You also have to ask what\\n\\n are cases of discrimination filed under 717, right?</p><p> Right.</p><p> I\\'m not really sure.</p><p> The question is where is  the detour to the Federal Circuit that you also  anticipate and seem to agree can happen.</p><p> Well, but you say -- the  question is whether it\\'s tolled while it\\'s sitting in  the Federal Circuit.</p><p> I hope so.</p><p> And those are classic\\n\\n \\n  discrimination claims that are filed in Federal district  court.</p><p> Not reasons. Where in the  language?</p><p> It doesn\\'t say that. It  says -- the except clause says, \"Cases of discrimination  filed under Federal discrimination laws.\" That\\'s what  it says.</p><p> Where?</p><p> But that -- that just\\n\\n raises the question what \"subject to\" means, right?\\n\\n And -- and you\\'re equating \"subject to\" with \"meeting\\n\\n the test of.\" But \"subject to\" can also mean subject\\n\\n to. It can be tested under. Not that it meets the\\n\\n test, but it can be tested under, right? That\\'s often\\n\\n how Congress uses that phrase.</p><p> Right.</p><p> All right.</p><p> No, just to continue to  make it up.</p><p> It may or may not qualify,\\n\\n not that it does qualify.</p><p> Just because it\\'s not  there doesn\\'t mean it shouldn\\'t be there. I agree with  you, but it\\'s not there.</p><p> Often, it\\'s used in that\\n\\n sense, right?</p><p> Really? Why not? You  just gave me a good example.</p><p> Do you have any authority  for that proposition?</p><p> Mr. Fletcher, when we\\'re  talking about folks knowing where to go and making it  easier on them, can you help me with the same question I  had for Mr. Landau? Which is (b)(), as I read it,  talks about cases of discrimination filed under Federal  discrimination laws go to district court, and everything  else goes to the Federal Circuit.  Now, that would be a nice clean rule; right?  Individuals would know that their civil service disputes  go to the Federal Circuit and discrimination claims go  to district court. We have to add a lot of words to the  statute on standards of review for the district court if\\n \\n47  they\\'re going to be reviewing administrative actions.  We have to ignore the standard of review that is  prescribed by the statute for the district court de novo  when it comes to certain claims that would come before  them. We have to worry about all this equitable tolling  as well, and a regulation that may or may not say what  the government says it says.  Wouldn\\'t it be a lot easier if we just  followed the -- the plain text of the statute? What am  I missing?</p><p> Where?</p><p> Where?</p><p> (c).</p><p> Besides Kloeckner.  Anything else?</p><p> Cases of discrimination?</p><p> -- rather than hang around  waiting in the Federal Circuit? Hopefully -- hopefully,  with a regulation that might or might not say that those  are tolled?</p><p> -- if you could just help\\n \\n\\n me with that.</p><p> I would have thought cases\\n\\n of discrimination under Federal discrimination statutes\\n\\n are cases of discrimination under Federal discrimination\\n\\n statutes --</p><p> -- and not civil service\\n\\n disputes.</p><p> Shall be filed under --</p><p> Right.</p><p> But why -- I\\'m sorry for  taking up so much time, I apologize.  My last question: Why does \"subject to\"  mean it has to meet the standards of 7702 rather than  it\\'s a claim that\\'s subject to the test of 7702?</p><p> Mr. -</p><p> Mr. Landau, that -- that  raises a question I have for you. Seem -- seems to me  that both sides agree on the premise that mixed cases  can go to the district court, so the district court can  adjudicate some civil service disputes.</p><p> But putting aside  Kloeckner -</p><p> So but -- by what -- what  authority does a district court ever have the power to  hear a civil service claim?</p><p> -- looking at the plain  language -</p><p> -- which makes sense for  discrimination claims, but not for civil service claims  that might tag along in district court.</p><p> The only standard of  review mentioned for district courts is de novo -</p><p> -- of the statute -</p><p> -- which makes sense for  civil service claims.</p><p> My question is just where.</p><p> And then I look at the  standards of review. And the standard of review for the  Federal Circuit talks about normal agency, APA-type  review, in (c) -</p><p> Where in the statute is  that provided? I look at 7703(b)(), and it speaks of  cases of discrimination filed under Federal  discrimination laws go to district court.</p><p> But it\\'s always only  actions of discrimination filed under Federal  discrimination statutes.</p><p> Mr. Landau, does that not  suggest that this detour to the Federal Circuit may not  be what\\'s prescribed by the statute and that, again,  bifurcation should take place and discrimination claims  should go to the district court in the first instance -</p>', 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>Then why -</p><p> That\\'s a kind of\\n \\n37  claim-splitting. I mean, you can say eventually it will  all get into the same place, but eventually can be can  be a long time. And as I said before, your  discrimination claim may have lapsed by then, and you  don\\'t guarantee that it will survive. And so that seems  to me something which is -- is -- you know, really cuts  against the way this scheme works in the vast majority  of cases, and the way we have said it should.</p><p> Well, the claim -- it\\'s  temporary claims-splitting. It\\'s -- you know, you have  to put your -- your discrimination claim on the back  burner and proceed with respect only to your civil  service claim and decide, you know, whether the -- the  board can -- can review that or not.</p><p> But the whole point of this  scheme, generally -- and we have said this, and it  appears on the face of the statute -- is to make sure  that the employee doesn\\'t have to claim-split.  And so we\\'ve said when the Board dismisses  your claim on the merits, you can take it to the  district court. And we have said that when it dismisses  your case on procedure, you can take it to the district  court. You can do everything in the district court, you  don\\'t have to split it up, do one thing in the Federal  Circuit and one thing in the district court.  And now, for this one category of thing,  which you call \"jurisdictional,\" Mr. Landau says in this\\n \\n36  case it looks an awful lot like a merits determination,  but anyway, for this one category of thing, we\\'re going  to treat it differently, we\\'re going to insist that you  split your claims and -- and not bring the  discrimination claim in the Federal Circuit because you  can\\'t bring it there, but instead you have to go to the  Federal Circuit on your CSRA claim.</p><p> But that\\'s -</p><p> It\\'s going to go back to\\n\\n the -- to the district court, eventually.</p><p> He still -- he still thinks  he has civil service claims, in addition to  discrimination claims.</p><p> That\\'s what the -- the Board  says, but we don\\'t know that, right? Isn\\'t it for the  district court to make exactly that determination?</p><p> Well, that\\'s what -</p><p> Well, that\\'s because the  Board didn\\'t -- said that it was not reviewing the  merits of his civil service claims. But he still thinks  he has civil service claims and discrimination claims,  and so he is rejecting the idea that the Board -- the  Board has said it\\'s not a mixed case, but he think it\\'s  still a mixed case.  And the question is, who decides that?  Because if it is a mixed case -- yes.</p><p> But this is only the  statement that the Board will address mixed cases.  It doesn\\'t say anything about what happens  if there\\'s a dispute as to whether there is a mixed  case, who gets to decide that question.</p><p> No, it obviously makes a\\n\\n distinction between allegations and -- and being\\n\\n affected by an action, but only -- all that this\\n\\n provision does is it defines what a mixed case is, and\\n\\n says the -- the Merit System Protection Board will\\n\\n decide that mixed case.\\n\\n And the definition of a mixed case has one\\n\\n \\n32  element, which is an actual thing, and another element,  which is an allegation.</p><p> No, it obviously --</p><p> I\\'m just asking you -- you\\n\\n know, you point to this language. This language doesn\\'t\\n\\n get you there. I\\'m just asking whether you have other\\n\\n language to point to that suggests that the \"who\\n\\n decides\" question ought to be in the Federal Circuit.</p><p> So I don\\'t see that,\\n\\n Mr. Fletcher, as addressed by this statutory language\\n\\n that you talk about. You know, you talk about 7702, and\\n\\n as Justice Alito said, you said (a) says, \"has been\\n\\n affected,\" and (b) says -- alleges that a basis for the\\n\\n action was discrimination. But all 7702 does, is it\\n\\n defines a category of cases, these mixed cases, and\\n\\n that\\'s what defines them, that it -- that the employee\\n\\n has been affected by a certain kind of action and makes\\n\\n a certain kind of allegation and it says, well, the\\n\\n Board decides that. And then 7703 says that,\\n\\n afterwards, it goes to the district court.\\n\\n But what is left completely unaddressed in\\n\\n this is the question of who decides whether this is a\\n\\n mixed case as defined by 7702. 7702 doesn\\'t tell you\\n\\n that. It\\'s a -- it\\'s a -- so -- so where in the statute\\n\\n do you think it tells you who decides whether something\\n\\n is a mixed case as defined by 7702?</p><p> The government says not, but\\n\\n it doesn\\'t cite anything when it says not.</p><p> Do you still have your civil\\n\\n service claims that you can bring in district court?</p><p> But say -- say you exhaust\\n\\n in the agency EEO.</p><p> You -- you\\'re being generous\\n\\n to the government, Mr. Landau. The government says that\\n\\n it\\'s only by regulation that they will toll the\\n\\n discrimination claim and that they could get rid of that\\n\\n regulation tomorrow. And then the discrimination claim\\n\\n would not be tolled, and you could run out of time on\\n\\n it; isn\\'t that right?</p><p> So but -</p><p> Do you think he has to ask\\n\\n that? Suppose he asked something else. Suppose he\\n\\n said, I\\'d like the district court just to decide this.\\n\\n Could he do that?</p><p> There are times where the\\n\\n district court does it without the Board\\'s doing it\\n\\n first, right? When the Board -- when the time period\\n\\n \\n\\n lapses?\\n\\n58</p><p> -- the question,  Mr. Fletcher, is a contested one.</p><p> Well, Kloeckner certainly  says it, but beyond Kloeckner, I mean, merits cases  that -- that have been -- have been going to district  court for years prior to Kloeckner; isn\\'t that right?</p><p> Right. This would be a kind\\n \\n51  of revolution, I mean, in -- in -- to the extent that  you can have a revolution in this kind of case.  (Laughter.)</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Certainly --</p><p> Just -- just as an\\n\\n introductory question, Mr. Landau -- it's really\\n\\n probably more for the government than for you -- but if\\n\\n the government were to review, this same case could\\n\\n potentially go from the Board to the Federal Circuit,\\n\\n back to the Board, then to the district court.\\n\\n Is there any other scheme like that? Is\\n\\n there anything that the government might point to that\\n\\n is an analogous scheme?</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': '<p>What -- what would I\\n\\n tell the practicing bar about what the board labels as\\n\\n jurisdictional really counts as jurisdictional?</p><p> So if we go down your  route, and I\\'m writing that opinion -- which I hope not,\\n \\n\\n but if I were --\\n\\n45\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> Could you please tell  me, besides this voluntary settlement issue, what else  is jurisdictional? What else besides something that  doesn\\'t match 7512, the furlough and suspension?</p><p> So there\\'s --</p><p> -- a whole lot of cases\\n\\n besides what I thought, 7512.

That\\'s generally considered a merits --</p><p> But as long as the\\n\\n person thinks the Board can hear this?</p><p> For some reason it  didn\\'t fall. Is that a jurisdictional?</p><p> You think that any  dismissal, whatever the basis -</p><p> What happens to the  Board\\'s finding that the settlement was voluntary?</p><p> And you then went to - back to the district court.</p><p> I\\'m sorry. Does that\\n\\n mean that a finding that this suspension or furlough\\n\\n wasn\\'t of the required number of days, is that\\n\\n jurisdictional? Are you -- or are you just arguing that\\n\\n this situation involving a settlement agreement is not\\n\\n actually jurisdictional?</p><p> Or that any ruling where\\n\\n the Board says we don\\'t have power to hear this case --</p><p> -- is not\\n\\n jurisdictional?</p><p> First, let\\'s -- let\\'s go  to the suspension.</p><p> You need to have a  suspension of a certain number of -</p><p> All right.

They could  be doing the same thing in Ohio, saying, we've got a lot  of plaintiffs here from California, but we're going  to -- we're going to let them sue in Ohio. And the same  thing's going to happen in every other State. I don't  see that it increases the efficiency at all.</p><p> But it's your case.  You ought to be able to at least answer -</p><p> If there were  in  California and 575, would that satisfy due process?</p><p> I know, but you're  articulating a rule that requires businesses trying to  figure out where to do business and plaintiffs where to  sue and courts whether it's real. Your rule depends  upon some line between handful and -- and hundreds, and  86 and 575.  Where is it, exactly?</p><p> But that's right.  You say handful in California, hundreds Tennessee and  Texas, no good. 86 in California, 575 somewhere else,  okay.</p><p> Okay. Well, you  have 86 in California and 575 elsewhere. And there's a  difference, I suppose, between handfuls and hundreds and  86 and 575, but where exactly that difference is, it  seems to me is going to be impossible to determine.</p><p> And you have -- you\\n\\n started out with the four different factors and all\\n\\n that.

Now,  I'm starting here; this is my problem.  Before International Shoe, I think basic  rule with qualifications, et cetera, a State is a  sovereign and can open its doors to whom it wants. End  of the matter. No. That isn't quite, but basic rule.  Now, along comes International Shoe, no, you can't, not  if it's unfair. Hence the questions.  Now, if that's what it is, if that's the  basic way to look at it -- and I hear the answers you've  given. Many, but not all, of those answers I could, I  think, have said the same thing in respect to  multidistrict litigation. And -- and so it sounds to  me, if I'm right on that -- which I might not be, you'd  have to say which ones aren't -- that what we need here  is a rule. We need a panel. We need Congress. We need  the multidistrict panel. But that isn't the  Constitution.  And then what I fear is if we say it's the  Constitution, what do we do to either the class actions  or maybe even multidistrict litigation? I think you  could solve that problem by putting the jurisdiction\\n \\n  transfer our court. But -- but you see, that's why I  think, what is it specifically that's special -- sorry,  but -</p><p> -- that's when lines -- all  right.</p><p> So once I'm here, I can now  sue him. And then --\\n \\n57</p><p> Why isn't the answer to  this, to my question, your question, which you raise a  lot, this is going to be a terrible problem for mass\\n \\n45  torts. Answer: Bring your case in Federal court. Now,  why couldn't these 572 or whatever people bring their  cases in Federal court?</p><p> I was here for that  purpose, not -</p><p> I cannot say, because you  are a citizen of Texas, because that cuts no ice in  California. So what is it I say in a single sentence  that does make it clear to that defendant why he is  here?</p><p> I'm trying to get the  answer in. I've got it.</p><p> Not all can. Not all can.</p><p> But -- but a very large -</p><p> -- number. And then that  very large number is no problem. They bring the case in  the place where there is jurisdiction, it's consolidated  in a multidistrict panel, and the multidistrict panel  sends it to that venue for trial, which is convenient  for all.  Now, what they'll say, yeah, I'll agree with  that. And then they'll say, the solution to this great  mass tort problem is that's what Federal courts are for.  It doesn't work perfectly, but neither does -- does  yours work perfectly.</p><p> So what is the response to  that?</p><p> I'm not disagreeing with  you.</p><p> Yeah. Correct.</p><p> But let's imagine it's a  home or whatever, and you say that a business is in that  State. You make it -- you -- you do business here, you  make things here. I don't care if you're home or not.  Make things here, do business here, incorporate here.  Now, you can be sued in any State still,  under special jurisdiction, where you cause harm, but  you can't be sued in States where you didn't. Now,\\n \\n38  that, I think, is what -- I think that's what they're  saying is the special federalism interest of either the  home State or the State where they did the  manufacturing, or the State where they, you know,  whatever the other one is where you count as a home  State. That does sound special.</p><p> Well, what you do is -</p><p> Fifth is different from the  Fourteenth?</p><p> How? How? How can  Congress step in if it's constitutional?</p><p> How, if it's  constitutional?</p><p> But why am I here in  respect to Smith? Because, you see, Smith isn't a  citizen of our State.  So where that answer sounded -- this is  logic, and what's bothering about the whole case is its  logic, and I don't know the practicalities. All right.  But -- but the -- you see, the logic doesn't seem the  same.</p><p> Can you -- this is answer  this in a sense -- all right. This is -- because you  just started to with Justice Ginsburg, no general  jurisdiction. Why am I here, says defendant. Because,  says the judge, you have enough activity in our State  for us to call you into court to answer to one of our  citizens who was hurt. That's special jurisdiction,  right?\\n \\n56</p><p> Isn't that what you write?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>-- Goodyear in confining\\n\\n general jurisdiction. And in this -- this very case, it\\n\\n was originally argued as a general jurisdiction case.\\n\\n Then we came out with Daimler, and then they said oh,\\n\\n no, we know it's not general jurisdiction. It's got to\\n\\n be specific.</p><p> What you're suggesting is\\n\\n that the Court was wrong in -- in Daimler and in the one\\n\\n before it --</p><p> So one comment that --\\n\\n that you, no doubt, know has been made about this case,\\n\\n is that it is an attempt to reintroduce general\\n\\n jurisdiction, which was lost in Daimler, by the\\n\\n backdoor.\\n\\n \\n55</p><p> But if they all -- if  they -- if they all allege the same basic flaw in the  drug, the -- the drug was defective but cost, and that's  determined in suit number , I take it that would be  issue preclusion.</p><p> If, for example, the\\n\\n drugs that -- that everyone bought all over the country\\n\\n was manufactured in one place, even though it wasn't\\n\\n the -- the place of business or the place of\\n\\n incorporation?</p><p> If --</p><p> But if this were -- if\\n\\n this were a case where the nonresident plaintiffs were\\n\\n \\n  suing Bristol-Myer in California, then everything you  say follows. But that's -- no one is urging that  California could assert jurisdiction against  Bristol-Myers on behalf of out-of State plaintiffs.  It's -- essential to this case is that there be a case  of Californians against Bristol-Myers, and this is  tagged on to it.</p><p> But could Congress make  it for trial? Right now, the multidistrict litigation  panels is only for pretrial. It can be a trial if  everyone consents. But absent consent, you have to go  back to where you began.  But would there be any constitutional  impediment to having a multidistrict statute amended so  that the -- the forum in which the cases are  consolidated could go on to the merits?</p><p> What about McKesson?\\n \\n  There -- there are two defendants here. McKesson is a  California corporation or principal place. Is there  another place where these plaintiffs could sue McKesson  as well as Bristol-Myers?</p><p> I mean, they -- what are\\n\\n they called, the single --</p><p> That's peculiar to -- to\\n\\n libel claims.</p><p> Yes, yes.</p><p> So it's context with the\\n\\n United States as opposed to an individual State. So if\\n\\n we -- if it's a Federal statute, then that -- and not\\n\\n hemmed in by State boundaries, it can create a\\n\\n nationwide claim.</p><p> But that's really not  possible. And it would be ideal if we could get all the  Plavix plaintiffs together in one forum. We have no way  of doing that because plaintiffs have many choices. And  so some individual plaintiffs chose to hook up with the\\n \\n32  California, but there's lots of -- there's one footnote  that says all the cases, some are multidistrict cases,  some are multiple plaintiff cases.  The -- so whatever we rule in -- in this  case, there's still going to be a lot of -- a lot of  Plavix litigation spread around the United States.</p><p> Special master is where?</p><p> And where -- if -- if so,  where could it be brought?</p><p> Could one of these  Plavix -- could the Plavix claim have been brought as a  class action?</p><p> McKesson is California.</p><p> This -- the -- this case\\n \\n46  couldn't be in Federal court because there's no complete  diversity.</p><p> Here that's not  possible -</p>\", 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': \"<p>But in MDL litigation,  you're in Federal court. So the procedures are common  across courts, in theory.</p><p> Maybe more in theory than  in practice.</p><p> Or -- or McIntyre, maybe?</p><p> Counsel, one thing we  haven't talked about, we've talked a fair amount about  fairness and predictability, but we haven't talked about  federalism. I know Mr. Katyal was trying to get to  that. I was hoping you might just give us a couple of  words about what implications there are for the  interests, say, of Ohio in administering its own  procedures with respect to its own citizens for torts  that occur in its own State.</p><p> Well, if you don't --\\n\\n sorry, Mr. Goldstein -- but if you don't need a single\\n\\n plaintiff to satisfy the first prong of the due process\\n\\n inquiry, again, what function does that first prong have\\n\\n left to do? Why doesn't it all just run into the second\\n\\n fundamental fairness test?</p><p> What's left?</p><p> Great question. Is it\\n \\n\\n presented?\\n\\n54</p><p> Well, but, Mr. Goldstein,  that's a very fact-specific argument. And we took this,  I thought, to decide the legal question whether we have  some sort of causation requirement or permit this  sliding scale business that California engages in, as a  legal matter. And on that, I just wonder if -- if we  move to this all-things-considered approach, are we  collapsing what had been previously two separate due  process inquiries, one was purposeful availment, and the  other was fundamental fairness. And as I hear it,  really, it all just boils down to fundamental fairness.\\n \\n\\n And as Judge Silverman said, a length of the\\n\\n39\\n\\n chancellor's foot.\\n\\n So I'm just wondering what happens\\n\\n doctrinally to the first test? Does it have any bite?\\n\\n And if it doesn't, does that suggest some problem\\n\\n doctrinally, formally, with your position?</p><p> What's confusing, though,  about simply saying here's the correct test, reverse,  remand, go apply the correct test?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>Can I take you back to  Justice Breyer's question about Federal courts -</p><p> So if that's your theory, it  doesn't matter whether there are 86 or  or zero,  because the contacts arise out of the  nationwide/California contacts.</p><p> Mr. Goldstein, it seems to  me, on your theory, it could be zero California  plaintiffs, because here's what you told me. You told  me that the reason that this -- that an Ohio citizen's  claim arises out of the contacts in California is  because the contacts in California are really nationwide  contacts. And if that's so, it's met regardless of  whether there are any California plaintiffs are not.</p><p> The claim arises out of  that.\\n \\n51</p><p> -- and multidistrict  litigation? Because you didn't say something that makes  me think, if you didn't say it, I don't understand.  Assuming that there was subject matter jurisdiction,  that there's diversity, it still it seems to me that the  way -- there's no nationwide service of process here.\\n \\n59  So the Federal courts have to mimic the State courts;  isn't that correct?</p><p> Yeah. I don't think that's  right, Mr. Goldstein. Our arising out of relating to  test, has always been about the first part of the  inquiry, and then all of the four factors is a backstop  to that. It's an additional test after we decide  whether your claim arises out of the forum contacts.</p><p> Can I take you back?</p><p> But you already know because  this is a nationwide marketing that you do, nationwide  drug, you already know that you're subject to  jurisdiction in any of the 50 States and have to be  prepared to confront jurisdiction in any of the 50  States.</p><p> Well, I guess what I'm  saying is that I -- the unfairness aspect of this is  what I really want to drive at, because predictability  just honestly doesn't seem like what's at issue here  given that you know it's perfectly predictable to have  litigation in any of the 50 States.\\n \\n  So the question is, why is it unfair to have  more litigation than you would in one of those States  rather than another?</p><p> Could you make this as  concrete as you can for me? And I -- I'm assuming that  your interests are the flip side to the plaintiffs'  interests. So why is it that a person would choose to  sue in California, and why is it that Bristol-Squibb  does not want more suits than necessary to happen in  California?</p><p> I guess -- I guess I'm --\\n\\n I'm feeling a little bit stymied here because I thought\\n\\n you were going to come at me with saying, look, the\\n\\n juries in California are different or there's punitive\\n\\n damages in California when there's not someplace else or\\n\\n the substantive rules might be different. And I'm not\\n\\n hearing any of that.</p><p> So on the plaintiff's side,  that seems a pretty attenuated interest, if -- because  usually when we say that the State has an interest, it's  in protecting their own citizens and providing their own  citizens with a forum. But here the citizen has decided  he doesn't want that protection, he wants to go  someplace else. It seems, you know, a little bit weak  to say that the State has a very strong interest in  protecting its own citizen that doesn't want to be  there.</p><p> But not necessarily to all  the plaintiffs here.</p><p> Those nationwide contacts  being a nationwide advertising campaign, a nationwide  marketing campaign, and so forth.</p><p> No, I understand that that's  your point. But I guess what I've always thought that  our personal jurisdiction cases require is somebody to  state in -- state something like this: The plaintiff's  claim relates to or arises out of the defendant's  contacts with the forum State. So here, Bristol-Myers'  contacts with California. And I just want you to tell  me how an Ohio plaintiff's claim arises out of or  relates to the defendant's contacts with California.  Just it -- it does because why?</p><p> But that's like saying,\\n\\n Mr. Goldstein, that the claim relates to another claim\\n\\n that relates to contacts with the forum. I mean, I\\n\\n guess I'm -- I'm missing what the relationship is\\n\\n between an Ohio plaintiff's claim and the defendant's\\n\\n contacts with the forum that doesn't go through another\\n\\n claim.</p><p> Well, how about the interest\\n\\n of the State that Bristol-Myers resides in? In other\\n\\n words, they might have an interest in not having their\\n\\n citizens hailed into court against their will in another\\n\\n part of the country.\\n\\n \\n37</p><p> Let me see if I understand  that, because you're saying -- usually we say how does  the claim relate to the contacts in a particular State,  say in California. Here we can't answer that question,  really. So we say now the contacts in California are  nationwide contacts, and the plaintiff's claim relates  to those nationwide contacts.</p><p> So who -- which State are we  worried about here? Are we worried about the  plaintiff's State, or are we worried about the  defendant's State?</p><p> You've timed it.</p><p> But it seems you're  conflating two things, Mr. Katyal. I mean,  individual -- a lot of individual California claims can  be joined, and then we can have an argument about what  should probably be joined and what can go off  individually. But -- but that's a different question  than the question in this case, which is, why is it  unfair to glom on Texas claims and New York claims to  the California claims, once we already have a mass  action which will have multiple injury trials?</p><p> Mr. Katyal, could we go back  to a form of Justice Kennedy's first question, which is,  just could you explain what defendant's interests are at\\n \\n\\n stake here? In other words, you know, usually we've\\n\\n\\n\\n looked to fairness for the defendant when we make the\\n\\n due process inquiry. So what is the unfairness here,\\n\\n given that there is another suit that's going to be\\n\\n going forward in California, and what Mr. Goldstein\\n\\n wants is just for additional claims of the exact same\\n\\n kind to be joined to that suit?</p><p> So could we just start with\\n\\n the fairness?</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>And that's not present\\n\\n here.</p><p> You've conceded that  there's fair play and substantial justice. That almost,  not quite, perhaps, takes away the due process argument,  which basically has to be the argument that you're  making here.</p><p> Right.</p><p> There was an injury in New\\n\\n Hampshire to that plaintiff.</p><p> Which doesn't -- that's  why due process is the same for Federal and State, but  there's a different set of criteria to which you apply  it. The States are limited in their jurisdiction to  nationwide, the Federal government isn't.</p><p> But what was the fourth?</p><p> I interrupted you at  first -</p><p> And could we have the  fourth of -- I interrupted -</p><p> And it's also true, it  would seem to me, that a State A has a very strong  interest in confining State B to State B's  territorial -</p><p> The States or the State?</p><p> But that's a very\\n\\n patronizing view of federalism. California will tell\\n\\n Ohio, oh, don't worry, Ohio, we'll take care of you.\\n\\n That's not -- that's -- that's not the idea of the\\n\\n Federal system. The Federal system says that States are\\n\\n limited.</p><p> Assume California law will  have that.

If there's a  California judgment that's valid, I assume, the  plaintiff is going to argue for issue preclusion. And  it -- it seems to me that actually helps you because - because it shows that this rule that you're proposing is  not so inefficient as the Respondent would say.</p><p> In the State court or the  Southern District?</p><p> Is it a Federal or State  master?</p><p> Single publication.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': '<p>But your position right  now is that in no suit will one court, State court, ever  be able to hear the entire controversy between a  plaintiff and a defendant.</p><p> Only when that\\'s general  jurisdiction.</p><p> I have no idea how you  draw that line.</p><p> What\\'s efficient about\\n\\n having piecemeal litigations across the country?</p><p> For years we\\'ve been\\n\\n approving pendent jurisdiction, or at least not taking\\n\\n any case that disturbed it, and there are cases in which\\n\\n we\\'ve just assumed it.

Under  your theory, that foreign corporation might be sued in  the particular State in which an injury occurred.

All the marketing, everything  is the same. The theory is the same. But because it\\'s  a foreign State, there\\'s no one jurisdiction -- a  foreign company, there\\'s no one jurisdiction in the  United States now under your theory.</p><p> If it is due process,  then -- and how do you say that it\\'s not due process  merely because it\\'s Federal?</p><p> Why would due process be  different?</p><p> But that is not a\\n \\n  Federal claim in -- that is a State law claim that would  be brought in -- in Federal court.</p><p> Mr. Katyal, assume a set\\n\\n of facts that I know have not been proven.\\n\\n Bristol-Myers sells the drugs to McKesson.

That was your  answer to Justice Ginsburg, that why did you get this  huge amount from disgorgement and only a small amount  under the other thing.

I'm\\n\\n sorry.</p><p> Well, if we -- if we\\n\\n think that's inappropriate and bad, we're not going to\\n\\n come out the other way because we trust the government\\n\\n not to bring an action like that.</p><p> But that's only with\\n\\n respect to -- that's only with respect to the amount of\\n\\n the remedy, not with respect to liability. So  years\\n\\n from the time that the fraud or whatever is committed,\\n\\n the government can bring an action for disgorgement\\n\\n against -- against the wrongdoer, and that action would\\n\\n proceed, despite this equitable limitation you're\\n\\n talking about.</p><p> You've argued that\\n\\n disgorgement -- that they're not entitled to\\n\\n equitable -- I don't remember if it's tolling or not\\n\\n because disgorgement is -- is punitive?</p><p> They're -- they're  sort of backing and filling. I mean, this remedy is out  there, and yes, they're saying this. But it does seem  to me that we kind of have a special obligation to be  concerned about how far back the government can go when  it's something that Congress did not address because it  did not specify the remedy.</p><p> Well, they're sort  of backing -</p><p> Well, it's a little\\n\\n circular, yeah.</p><p> One reason we have  this problem is that the SEC devised this remedy or  relied on this remedy without any support from Congress.  If Congress had provided, here's a disgorgement remedy,  you would expect them, as they typically do, to say,  here's a statute of limitations that goes with it. And  including, as your friend says, usually a statute of  limitations and an accompanying statute of repose.  Now, it was a concern -- you know, Chief  Justice Marshall said it was utterly repugnant to the\\n \\n\\n genius of our laws to have a penalty remedy without\\n\\n32\\n\\n limit. Those were the days when you could write\\n\\n something like that and it's about a statute of\\n\\n limitations. It's utterly repugnant.\\n\\n And it -- the concern, it sees seems to me,\\n\\n is multiplied when it's not only no limitation, but it's\\n\\n something that the government kind of devised on its\\n\\n own. I mean, I think -- doesn't that cause concern?</p><p> Ms. Goldenberg.\\n\\n ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J.

I gather your position would be if disgorgement  was required under the securities law, that's  remedial -- right? -- and -- and therefore is not  subject to the statute of limitations. But if that same  defendant tried to deduct that remedial relief, you  would say you can't do that because it's punitive.  So the same payment is characterized by your  client as remedial in one context and punitive in  another.</p><p> In the SEC context?</p><p> IRS.</p><p> Yes.\\n \\n47</p><p> So not only is it  one thing in one context, but something else in the  other context.

But in order  to decide whether this thing is a penalty or a  forfeiture, we need to understand what this thing is.  And in order to understand what it is, it would  certainly be helpful and maybe essential to know what  the authority for it is.  So how do we get out of that -- out of that  situation? How do we decide whether it is a penalty or  a forfeiture without fully understanding what this form  of this remedy or this, whatever it is, where it comes  from and -- and its exact nature?</p><p> Well, why don't we take it  as we find it in this particular case? So is there any  difficulty in identifying the victims in this particular  case and ensuring that the money that was  misappropriated from them by your client goes to them  and not into the government's coffers?</p><p> But, again, we don't know.  How do we know that the government has the authority to\\n \\n\\n direct it wherever it wants?</p><p> Well, I -- the courts say\\n\\n that, but where -- what is the basis for it?

Sorry. The other way\\n \\n\\n around.\\n\\n38</p><p> A thing -- neither a fine,  nor a punishment -- I'm not being facetious, I'm -- I'm  trying to get it in my mind.  Neither a fine, nor a punishment takes from  someone a thing that he was not rightfully entitled to.</p><p> Okay. I got that one. Is  there another way? Is there another one?</p><p> That's a difference.</p><p> And here -- here you take  away things only that the person was not rightfully  entitled to.</p><p> Yes, often does. Sometimes  doesn't.</p><p> -- disgorgement might not.  A punishment, you say, does take something away from you  that you're rightfully entitled to.\\n \\n37</p><p> -- from a serious  punishment.</p><p> Now, let's look at those.  Punishment. It doesn't take -- it takes  away from somebody something he normally -- he would not  be rightfully entitled to.  So a person who is walking along the street  and commits a crime and is thrown into jail is not  deprived of his liberty. Hmm? I mean, I would think  his liberty is something he is normally rightfully\\n \\n36  entitled to. And I would think it is a punishment to  put the person in jail. So I suspect that that  characteristic is not much of a distinguishing  characteristic -</p><p> Well, those are the things  that distinguish it.</p><p> Those are the two.</p><p> Yes. I agree -</p><p> No, no. Go ahead. I'm  more interested in what you say.</p><p> Yes.

Someone  comes along and says, I have a houseboat. It's not a  house. Houses don't go on water. Not a boat. Look at  the French windows, look at the venetian blinds. No  tax.  Now, I think that would last about five  minutes, that argument. All right? So I would like to  know from you a list of the categories,  characteristics -- characteristics, significant  characteristics, of disgorgement which are shared  neither by fines nor by forfeitures.  In what respect is disgorgement like neither  of those?\\n \\n35</p><p> And I think that's the\\n\\n question that's being asked.

You said the difference was that we are taking\\n\\n with disgorgement, property, money, or the equivalent\\n\\n that he, the defendant, did not rightly have. Perhaps\\n\\n he stole it. Okay?\\n\\n Now we have a criminal case. Judge, you\\n\\n stole the Hope Diamond. I cannot take that value, which\\n\\n you've gotten rid of the diamond, but you have several\\n\\n million, I can't take that and give it to the victims.\\n\\n I don't even know who they are. So I'm going to impose\\n\\n a penalty, a fine, and the fine will equal the value of\\n\\n the Hope Diamond. Is that a fine?</p><p> Let's look at each  category.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Narrow -- narrow\\n\\n construction of what?</p><p> What is your answer to\\n\\n the -- to the deduction there?

So it's  much larger than the penalty.</p><p> I thought the government  took the position that you could deduct expenses, if the  measure of what is turned over is the ill-gotten gains,  then money made to reduce those costs incurred in -- in  making those gains, should be deducted. I didn't think\\n \\n  the government was saying -- I think the -- the court of  appeals said that, but that seemed to me quite wrong.</p><p> -- kind of an unreality\\n\\n to that argument because here there was a fine. It was\\n\\n a relatively modest amount compared to the huge amount\\n\\n awarded for this disgorgement. So to say, oh, the --\\n\\n the penalty, that's something added on, that's something\\n\\n that he -- is he being punished by, say,  million.\\n\\n \\n39  But how much was the disgorgement in this  case?</p><p> But is it --</p><p> Well, we'll ask the\\n\\n government what their position is, whether it's totally\\n\\n in their discretion whether they want to give this to\\n\\n victims or keep it all.</p><p> It may or may not be\\n\\n possible to find the victims. They may be dead.

Yet the SEC has  been asking for this kind of relief now for, what, over  30 years?  Has there been any effort, any activity in  Congress to make this clear, one way or another, whether  disgorgement fits with forfeiture?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': \"<p>Right.</p><p> The very same remedy.</p><p> Ms. Goldenberg, when we  get to the criminal context, this very same remedy of  disgorgement of everything is often called a forfeiture,  and it is a penalty; right? So why does it make a  difference that we just happen to be in the civil  context?</p><p> And how do we ever know?\\n\\n I mean, goodness gracious, the difference between civil\\n\\n and criminal has vexed this Court for many years.</p><p> Not in this Court.</p><p> Well, the same thing is  true in the criminal context, right? I mean, we have  criminal forfeitures where the money goes to the  government and sometimes it's distributed to victims,  but we don't doubt that those are penal in nature.</p><p> So does everything turn on  whether the government labels a -- a particular  disgorgement civil versus criminal?</p><p> So why does the form,\\n\\n whether this is civil versus criminal, make all the\\n\\n difference?</p><p> Like lenity.</p><p> And sometimes the money  goes to the victim and sometimes it doesn't. Just like  here.</p><p> We don't apply the canon\\n\\n in criminal cases, so why should we apply it in a case\\n\\n where the penalty is identical to what might be a\\n\\n criminal penalty?</p><p> Well, here we don't know,  because there's no statute governing it.

And that the rule should follow, depending on\\n\\n which is true.</p><p> Ms. Goldenberg, in those 50\\n\\n years, has -- has the SEC or has the Justice Department\\n\\n ever set down in writing what the guidelines are for how\\n\\n the SEC is going to use disgorgement and what\\'s going to\\n\\n happen to the monies collected?</p><p> I must say I find it unusual\\n\\n that the SEC has not given some guidance to its\\n\\n enforcement department or -- or that the Department of\\n\\n Justice hasn\\'t become involved in some way; that -- that\\n\\n everything is just sort of up to the particular person\\n\\n at the SEC who decides to bring such a case.</p><p> What is the private statute  of limitations?</p><p> When -- when the SEC uses  this, is it usually going after continuing misconduct,  or does it sometimes really reach back into the past for  completed conduct?</p><p> Just -- just out of  curiosity, when -- I\\'m sorry.</p><p> Because I look at this\\n\\n and -- and it seems to be a commonsensical kind of way\\n\\n \\n59  of looking at the way this remedy works, the way the SEC  has used it, is that it\\'s trying to do a lot of things.  It\\'s trying to compensate. It\\'s trying to deter. It\\'s  trying, to some extent, to punish misconduct that it - it sees, you know, and that it\\'s a little bit artificial  to try to tear them apart. And then if you accept Mr.  Unikowsky\\'s standard, that suggests that he has the  better of the arguments.

A fine\\n\\n is a payment in addition to the conduct that you\\n\\n committed. So there is a difference there.</p><p> Counselor, before the  1970s -- and you haven\\'t shown me anything to the  contrary -- forfeiture was an in rem proceeding where  the property was attached; the money, the bank account,  a piece of property, a home, whatever, but it was not a  personal action against an individual. So how do we get  from that traditional understanding which governed this  statute to your meaning today? Because there is a vast  difference between in rem and in personam actions.</p><p> It\\'s a question I\\'m\\n\\n going to ask your adversary, but what do you see as the\\n\\n difference between -- besides the statute of\\n\\n limitations, what\\'s the difference between restitution\\n\\n and disgorgement?</p><p> What\\'s the name of that  case?</p><p> Right. So -</p><p> So what is the  difference from restitution?</p><p> I think making someone\\n\\n whole is a forfeiture. Give up the illegal gains you\\n\\n got.</p><p> And you are in  traditional forfeiture saying, give back that pot.  In this situation, we\\'re not asking for that  pot. We don\\'t care where the money comes from. We\\'re  saying you\\'re liable for a fixed money judgment that  you\\'re going to give up. So how is that not the same as  a penalty? Because a penalty is saying to someone,  you\\'ve committed a wrong. We don\\'t care what you did  with that pot that you got. We\\'re not asking you in a  traditional forfeiture sense to turn that pot over.  We\\'re asking you to give money from whatever sources you  may have, other sources, and pay for the wrong that you\\n \\n\\n did.\\n\\n41\\n\\n So isn\\'t it analytically more like a penalty\\n\\n than it is like making someone whole?</p><p> Now, in forfeiture,  you\\'re tracing in some metaphysical way a pot that has  been wrongfully taken.</p><p> So if this is the  houseboat, why don\\'t we call this restitution?</p><p> Why isn\\'t this  restitution?</p><p> Doesn\\'t matter. The\\n\\n question --</p><p> -- is --</p><p> I don\\'t know what I was\\n\\n buying, but I bought something. I got the benefit just\\n\\n because I was able to direct it. So I don\\'t know that\\n\\n that moves me.</p><p> Well, I don\\'t know why\\n\\n that proves anything. If I commit a crime and take my\\n\\n proceeds and give half of it to Justice Breyer --\\n\\n (Laughter.)</p><p> It gets more complicated\\n\\n than that, because the money goes to the court --</p><p> -- according to the\\n\\n government, and it\\'s the court that decides how the\\n\\n money will be paid out, correct?</p><p> Could Congress pass a  statute giving the SEC the authority to bring these  actions for however long a period Congress chooses?</p><p> And then the question  becomes what you answered earlier, which is, if it\\'s  being paid to the victim, is it really restitution as  opposed to disgorgement. And if it\\'s restitution, is it  compensatory damages subject to the existing statute of  limitations.</p><p> -- if it looks like a\\n\\n forfeiture, why don\\'t we treat it like a forfeiture?</p>'}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': '<p>Thank you, counsel.  Mr. Brasher.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS</p><p> We\\'ll hear argument  first this morning in Case -5294, McWilliams v. Dunn.  Mr. Bright.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  Three minutes, Mr. Bright.  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT\\n \\n54  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> Thank you, counsel.  The case is submitted.  (Whereupon, at :01 a.m., the case in the  above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> Mr. Bright, before\\n\\n you move on to that, you say it\\'s clear. The LaFave\\n\\n treatise on criminal law -- which I think is, if not the\\n\\n most cited treatise in this Court, certainly one of\\n\\n them -- this is a quote: \"Ake -- Ake appears to have\\n\\n been written so as to be deliberately ambiguous on this\\n\\n point, thus, leaving the issue open for future\\n\\n consideration.\"\\n\\n So your position has to be that the LaFave\\n\\n treatise is -- is wrong, it wasn\\'t ambiguous at all --</p><p> Justice Ginsburg.</p><p> -- in your -- in\\n\\n your reply brief in -- on page , you\\'ve got four\\n\\n examples where you say the language clearly shows that\\n\\n they were meant -- meant to be -- I don\\'t know what the\\n\\n word is, but you hope it\\'s not partisan or nonobjective,\\n\\n but aligned experts, I guess. And the first one, they\\n\\n are supposed to provide assistance that may well be\\n\\n crucial to the defendant\\'s ability to marshal his\\n\\n defense.\\n\\n Well, you can certainly understand the\\n\\n assistance being here is the diagnosis, this is what\\n\\n \\n  these medical terms mean, this is what the, you know,  rules are or this is -- you know, it doesn\\'t necessarily  mean that they are going to be partisan in helping shape  the defense.  The other one -- another one of the four you  say is that they\\'re needed to translate a medical  diagnosis into language that will assist the trier of  fact. Well, that doesn\\'t entail partisanship of any  kind. It -- it\\'s simply sort of a medical instruction.  You know, this particular term means this, and then the  lawyer can go off and develop her defense.</p><p> Well, you say --</p><p> Well, they do, but\\n\\n your position has to be that LaFave made a mistake, the\\n\\n Fifth Circuit made a mistake, eight State courts -- the\\n\\n final State courts made mistakes, the -- on remand in\\n\\n \\n\\n Ake, it was a mistake. All of those things -- not\\n\\n\\n\\n saying whether you\\'re right or wrong on the merits, but\\n\\n that body of authority that takes a different position\\n\\n would seem to me to establish that the question was\\n\\n ambiguous, at least coming out of Ake, as opposed to\\n\\n clearly established.</p><p> What do you mean by  \"State experts\"?</p><p> So you mean they  were paid for work by the State -</p><p> -- as opposed to  being -- working for the prosecution for a particular\\n \\n\\n result in a given case.</p><p> -- it wasn\\'t\\n\\n deliberately ambiguous.</p><p> Provided by the  State or working for the prosecution?</p>', 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>So what would you say to  this court-appointed -- you -- you get one expert that's  appointed -- what do you say to this expert? Now, I  don't really want you to give your neutral opinion. I  want to give you -- I want you to give your most  defense-friendly opinion on this?</p><p> -- that's what I'm getting  at. I don't see how an expert who is chosen by the  court and paid by the court can ever function in  anything like that capacity for a defendant. And one  thing that is perfectly clear from the opinion in Ake,  is that the court would pick the expert, and it's one - the court will pick one expert and that's it; the  defense has to live with it.\\n \\n  And I just -- if you could explain how that  kind of an expert can ever function like an expert  retained by the defense.</p><p> Am I wrong?</p><p> It is different from a  lawyer, because a lawyer -- you know, a lawyer doesn't  have to believe in the client's innocence. The lawyer  has a professional duty, within the bounds of -- of  professional responsibility, to do everything that can  be done to advance the interests of the client. But an  expert who's going to write a report and is going to  testify, presumably, if the person acts in good faith,  is going to give an honest opinion.</p><p> Right.</p><p> Yeah, well, that's what  I'm -</p><p> Mr. Bright --</p><p> No that's true. There have\\n\\n been a lot of lower courts, a lot of smart judges have\\n\\n read Ake and they found it ambiguous. And I wonder if\\n\\n this may have been what went on in their minds. We know\\n\\n what's -- what was going on in Ake because we have\\n\\n \\n53  written opinions like that, and we have joined opinions  like that. This is an opinion that is deliberately  ambiguous, because there was probably disagreement among  the members of the majority about how far they wanted to  go.  Do you think that's a reasonable hypothesis?</p><p> But I -- but in terms of  what this expert would do, you'd want an expert who  would function more or less like that.</p><p> As I understand your\\n\\n position -- and you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- you\\n\\n seem to be arguing that what the defendant is entitled\\n\\n to is an expert who will function, more or less, like\\n\\n the kind of expert who would be retained by the defense,\\n\\n if the defense were simply given funds to -- to hire an\\n\\n expert.\\n\\n Am I right in -- in thinking that?</p><p> Well, no, I understand.  That really wasn't my question. I -- of course you  could ask the expert, you know, give me the -- give me  whatever is most favorable, give me advice that is most  favorable to my client. But when it comes down to  giving an opinion about whether the individual is sane  or -- or something that's relevant to mitigation, I\\n \\n\\n don't see how you can ask the expert to do anything\\n\\n\\n\\n other than to give the expert's honest professional\\n\\n opinion.\\n\\n So it doesn't -- it's -- I'm having\\n\\n difficulty seeing how an expert who is appointed by the\\n\\n court -- you get one -- could ever function that way.\\n\\n And I -- I read the oral argument transcript in this\\n\\n case, and there are several places in the oral argument\\n\\n transcript when -- where the court and the attorney for\\n\\n Ake equates an -- an expert who is appointed by the\\n\\n court with a neutral expert. And that seems to be what\\n\\n that kind of an expert would be, a neutral expert, not\\n\\n an expert who is really part of the defense team.</p><p> Mr. Brasher, I thought the  question on which we granted cert was whether somebody  with the status of Dr. Goff sat -- whether it was  clearly established that somebody with the status of  Dr. Goff did not satisfy Ake, not whether Dr. Goff,  given his status, did the things that he was supposed to  do under Ake.\\n \\n40</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>And what the dissent says  is that is precisely what the Court doesn\\'t hold. And I  wish they would. I\\'ve written dissents like that, too.  We all have. But if it\\'s a dissent and you say that  isn\\'t what the Court holds, that\\'s at least some  evidence that that wasn\\'t what the Court held.</p><p> Did the --</p><p> Did the -- did the\\n\\n defendant ask for an expert? On page  of their brief,\\n\\n they quote the Respondents, these court of appeals,\\n\\n which says that there is no indication in the record\\n\\n that McWilliams could not have called Dr. Goff, or the\\n\\n trial court indicated that it would have considered a\\n\\n motion to present an expert. But McWilliams says the\\n\\n Respondent chose not to file one.\\n\\n And your brief on page  doesn\\'t say he did\\n\\n ask for an expert. He wanted more time.</p><p> Did he ask? He said,\\n\\n Judge, please appoint an expert. Did he?</p><p> Yeah. Well, did he or\\n\\n didn\\'t he? Yes or no.</p><p> And then he ended up by\\n\\n saying, that is why we renew the motion for a\\n\\n continuance.</p><p> Does it say that? Where\\n\\n did it say that? I just don\\'t see --</p><p> -- where he said.</p><p> Did he ask the judge to\\n\\n appoint --</p><p> The answer is no, then; is\\n\\n that right?</p><p> Okay.</p><p> Where, somewhere else, does\\n\\n it become apparent that he wants the State to appoint an\\n\\n expert? Where? I just want to know where.</p><p> I\\'m not seeing --</p><p> Would you -- would you  object to the following disposition of the case: That  we say the issue is not partisan versus independent.  The issue is whether the defense had assistance from a  psychiatrist in the evaluation, preparation, and  presentation of the defense, including cross-examination  of hostile or State psychiatric witnesses. That\\'s what  Ake provides. That\\'s clear. And what we want you to  do, court of appeals, is decide whether that was so.</p><p> Would you agree with that  or not?</p><p> You do agree with it.</p><p> If they did not -</p><p> If they did not give the - if they did not give him psychiatric assistance and pay  for it, a psychiatrist who would have done those four  things that I just mentioned, then they did violate  clearly established law -</p><p> -- because that\\'s what Ake  says.</p><p> It seemed in the defense - well, here, what about this. Are you saying this? \"The  defendant should be entitled to one competent opinion  from the psychiatrist who acts independently of the  prosecutor\\'s office.\" That\\'s, I think, what you\\'re  arguing.  I mean, it\\'s a trick question.  (Laughter.)</p><p> Yeah. But maybe he already\\n\\n has --</p><p> -- someone --</p><p> Maybe he already has an\\n\\n expert. They did have someone advising them.</p><p> I saw it, but what about\\n\\n the point that Justice Kagan raised. She was quoting\\n\\n from the opinion. Why do we have to get into an\\n\\n argument about whether they can be independent or\\n\\n partisan? An expert should not be -- he should give his\\n\\n honest opinion. That\\'s what they\\'re supposed to do.\\n\\n Why is that the right characterization? Why not just\\n\\n quote from the opinion?</p><p> The defense has to have\\n\\n somebody who will conduct an appropriate examination,\\n\\n assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of\\n\\n the defense. And in case we\\'re unclear what that means,\\n\\n the court previously said that that person, the object\\n\\n is, is the insanity defense viable, present testimony to\\n\\n that effect, assist in preparing the cross-examination\\n\\n of a State psychiatric witness. So why do we have to\\n\\n \\n35  say more than? That\\'s the question. And here it seems  to me that this defendant certainly did not get that  help.</p><p> Because, of course, I\\'m  quoting from the dissent.</p><p> He came in, they presented  a -- a report, I\\'ve read pages from the report. And  that report was apparently controversial. And did the  defendant have someone to do cross-examination, help him  with that, help him understand the report, et cetera,  and that\\'s the end of the case.</p><p> So what? So what? I\\'m  sorry, I\\'m not being facetious. I\\'m -- I mean,  literally, I\\'m -- I don\\'t know the answer to that.  So what? Did he have a person who could  look at the report, help him cross-examine, help him  understand? Now, who was that person?</p><p> I didn\\'t see one here.</p><p> Mr. Goff?</p><p> He didn\\'t seem to be his  expert. He seemed to be a member of the State Lunacy  Commission. I don\\'t think he consulted -- did he  consult with the defense attorney before? Did he  explain to the defense attorney? Et cetera, et cetera.</p><p> Oh, all right.</p><p> Fine, fine. I\\'m assuming  he was a fine doctor.  My question is, did he assist the defense in  the cross-examination? Did he assist -- of himself, I  doubt it. Did he assist in the preparation, the -- you  know, these -- those four things that were listed? Did  he or did he not?\\n \\n37</p><p> And he was -- and why was  there no cross-examination?</p><p> Because he was the defense  expert?</p>', 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': '<p>But the word  \"assistance,\" you know, we use it -- we use it most  often is, the defendant is entitled to the assistance of  counsel. Assistance of counsel doesn\\'t mean neutral.\\n \\n32  And this -- the one thing that stands out in this case  is the word assist the defense, assisting, adversarial.  The -- those at least are clues that what the decision  writer had in mind was assisting the defense, just as a  lawyer assists the defense.</p><p> Including -- including\\n\\n Alabama, am I right, that in 2005, the Alabama Court of\\n\\n Criminal Appeals said Ake made it clear that an indigent\\n\\n defendant is entitled to an independent expert devoted\\n\\n to assisting his defense, not one providing the same\\n\\n information or advice to the court and prosecution.</p><p> Is there -- is there any  jurisdiction that holds that today, that all that Ake  requires is a neutral expert? I thought by now every  jurisdiction recognizes that Ake requires an expert who  will be, essentially, part of the defense team.</p><p> One -- one facet of this  case you presented as -- as -- the defense is asking for  a defense-oriented expert. And you said that there was  no such expert for the State. But I think the opinion  itself says that: Before the sentencing judge, the  prosecutor relied on the testimony of State  psychiatrists who had testified at the guilt phase, that  he was dangerous to society.  So the judge -- before the judge imposed the  sentence, is looking back to the guilt phase where there  were experts for the State, not independent, whatever,  they were called by the prosecutor to testify to future  dangerousness.</p><p> I\\'m talking about the\\n\\n facts of Ake.</p><p> I -- I\\'m not asking about  that particular issue, but I thought that the sentencing  judge now, after the guilt phase, is looking to the  testimony that was given at the guilt phase by experts  who were prosecution experts, not neutral experts.</p><p> This is all in Ake.</p><p> If you prevail, it would  be a new sentencing hearing, right?</p><p> Yeah, because guilt is  over.</p><p> Yes.</p><p> May I -</p><p> -- is that so,\\n \\n  Mr. Bright, if -- if it\\'s -- we\\'re informed correctly by  the Respondent that on remand in Ake itself, the lower  courts held that due process is satisfied by the  assistance of a neutral psychiatrist.  So if it was all that clearly established,  it was not understood by -- in the very case that was  argued here, and that on remand, according to the  Respondent at least, the lower courts held a neutral  psychiatrist is good enough.</p><p> Why -</p><p> But we\\'re told here that  the -- that the -- the prosecution didn\\'t have a\\n \\n  partisan expert either, that there was this -- everyone  who was appointed was a neutral expert serving the  court, the prosecution, and the defendant.  So I think, roughly, it suggests you\\'re  asking for something that the prosecution didn\\'t have,  didn\\'t have an independent expert.</p>', 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': \"<p>Experts widely disagree on  everything. That's why -</p><p> -- you hire them.</p><p> But, counsel, if we could  just follow up on that. Doesn't it imply that a neutral  expert would be permissible?</p><p> Where -- where is the\\n\\n stopping point, then? Because common law history, our\\n\\n tradition is that often courts could apply and appoint a\\n\\n neutral expert of its own choosing. If the defense now\\n\\n has a right to a particular kind of expert, partisan\\n\\n expert --</p><p> Well, if I might just\\n\\n finish, and then you can tell me where I've gone off the\\n\\n rails.\\n\\n Where's the stopping point? Is it just\\n\\n psychiatry? Would we also have to apply the same rule\\n\\n in other kinds of medicine, perhaps? Forensic science?\\n\\n Where is the stopping point that you would advocate for\\n\\n the Court?</p><p> And why they cost so very  much.</p><p> That's -- that's my other  question, is if due process requires a partisan expert,  surely it would also require a partisan lawyer, in which  case what does the Sixth Amendment do? Does it  guarantee the -- the right of effective assistance of  counsel, it's just superfluous?</p><p> But it would be something\\n\\n we'd have -- an implication we would clearly have to\\n\\n consider.</p><p> Mr. Brasher, one piece of  evidence about what a holding means is what the parties  ask for in an adversarial system, where parties  generally control the outcome of cases, in terms of the  issues presented. And in Ake, as I understand it,\\n \\n47  defense counsel asked for either a partisan expert or a  court-appointed expert. Would have been satisfied with  either one.  Is my understanding wrong?</p><p> Mr. Brasher -</p><p> Maybe what the parties  actually -</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': '<p>General, that just has to be\\n\\n wrong as a statement of how we figure out what clearly\\n\\n established is. We don\\'t look at the facts in the QP,\\n\\n we look at the holding.</p><p> That would be quite  something, I have to say, General. If we say: Listen,  when you read our opinions and when you try to figure  out what we\\'re saying, what you have to do is go back to  the QP and just narrow it to exactly what the QP said.  I think that that would be a shocking way to  interpret this Court\\'s opinions.</p><p> This is what the holding\\n\\n says. You\\'re entitled to somebody who will assist you\\n\\n in evaluating, preparing, and presenting your defense.\\n\\n \\n46</p><p> -- where there was, in fact,  a neutral expert. And -- and -- and the court talks  about why it doesn\\'t have to pay attention to Smith v.  Baldi. I\\'m just curious as to what your interpretation  of these paragraphs are, because -- well, I\\'ll just  leave it like that.</p><p> Mr. Bright, can I ask you\\n\\n \\n  for your interpretation of -- there are two paragraphs  on page 85 which talk about Smith v. Baldi, which was a  case -</p><p> Mr. Bright, even the\\n\\n terminology that you are using, both here and in your\\n\\n briefs, contains some ambiguity, because you keep\\n\\n saying, well, Ake established the rights to an\\n\\n independent expert. But \"independent\" can mean, really,\\n\\n the defense expert, or \"independent\" can mean\\n\\n independent of both the prosecutor and the defense.\\n\\n \\n  And what you are saying that Ake held was  that it was a defense expert. But -- and there are  certainly parts of the opinion that read like that.  There\\'s no question that when Ake talks about assistance  over and over again, it reads like a defense expert.  But the question is, did Ake really preclude the idea of  a completely independent person, independent of both the  State and the defense?</p><p> No, no, no. And it\\'s not\\n\\n taking about parity. All it\\'s saying is that we\\n\\n recognize that the State is going to have experts, we\\n\\n recognize that if you had money you would have experts,\\n\\n we recognize that mental health is one of those things\\n\\n that people can have different opinions about, and that\\n\\n people would really like to have experts.</p><p> Sorry, General, but if we  could just focus on -- because I think it would help to  just sort of -- let\\'s assume for the moment that this  defendant did not get what he was asking for, which was  a defense expert, and say whether Ake entitled him to  such an expert.  And I just want to sort of focus on the  money sentence in Ake, you know, what -- the \"we  therefore hold\" sentence. And it says -- here\\'s what we  hold. \"We hold that when the defendant makes this  preliminary showing that mental health is going to be at  issue, the State must assure the defendant access to a  competent psychiatrist who will assist in evaluation,  preparation and presentation of the defense.\" So assist  in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the  defense. And, you know, recognizing that we\\'re all  smart people, and we can read any words, we can have an  argument that any words mean anything we say, still,  \"assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of  the defense,\" doesn\\'t that mean, like, you know, that\\'s  what you -- that\\'s the phrase you would use for a  counsel, to assist in evaluation, preparation, and  presentation of the defense. It means somebody on the  defendant\\'s side.</p><p> Well, they\\'re capable in the  sense that sometimes they might, but it\\'s not what you  would -- this is -- I -- I guess I\\'m repeating myself,  but this is the language that you use when you\\'re  talking about, not somebody who sometimes might, and is  capable of, but who, in fact, will do so, to the best of  his ability, assist the defendant.</p><p> And we\\'re going to give this\\n\\n \\n44  indigent person a single one who will be able to assist  him in these ways, in evaluating, preparing, and  presenting the defense.</p><p> But again, General, I mean,  the actual holding of Ake calls for assistance in  evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the  defense. And the theme of Ake, if you will, is all  about how we used to think that psychiatric opinions  were just like one thing, but now we know better. We  know that different psychiatrists have different\\n \\n\\n opinions, and it\\'s really important to arm even an\\n\\n43\\n\\n indigent defendant with the tools that he needs to come\\n\\n back at the State and to say -- and to say -- and to\\n\\n establish what he wants to establish about his mental\\n\\n health.\\n\\n I mean, that\\'s really the theme of the\\n\\n opinion, that you have to give the indigent defendants,\\n\\n just as you give the wealthier defendant, the tools that\\n\\n they need to establish what they want to establish about\\n\\n mental health. And then that\\'s consistent with the --\\n\\n with these words that are repeated in the holding and\\n\\n elsewhere.</p><p> But sometimes the Court goes  beyond what the facts are, and sometimes -- you know,  sometimes it issues a holding that\\'s just precisely  calibrated to the facts, and sometimes broader. And - and it seems that what we do is we look at the language,  we look at what the Court said, and said given what the  Court said, is this right clearly established.  And I guess, again, just to repeat what  Justice Ginsburg said, I started counting up the word  \"assist\" in this opinion and, frankly, I lost track.  That every time this opinion talks about this, it talks\\n \\n33  about assisting the defense and assisting the defendant,  including to cross-examine the prosecution. It just  seems that the premise of the entire opinion is you\\'re  on the defense team.</p><p> Well, at first it does,  you\\'re exactly right. And this is why I asked about  Baldi. I find those two paragraphs incredibly  confusing, because the first paragraph says, we\\'re  distinguishing it because there it was a neutral expert.  And then the second paragraph says, anyhow, Baldi -- I  mean, it does -- it doesn\\'t use the term overall, but a  lower court would be crazed if it relied on Baldi after  that opinion.</p><p> No, no, no. Two paragraphs  might be confusing, but the question is, what does the\\n \\n\\n opinion say, and particularly, what does the holding\\n\\n34\\n\\n say?</p>', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Suppose we thought that - and it's not your position, I understand it -- that Ake  was ambiguous on this point. And then over time, it  became clear that, really, the psychiatrist ought to be  consulting with the defense and -- and not with the  prosecution.  Would we say that the basic right was  clearly established, and that over time, we are simply  making a refinement, or if we think Ake is ambiguous --\\n \\n  I know you'll disagree -- if we think Ake is ambiguous,  we are establishing a new right -</p><p> So you say that there's\\n\\n always a conflict of interest unless the psychiatrist\\n\\n works for the defending -- for the defense only.</p><p> Okay.</p><p> Suppose the Judge, the  court, appoints the head of the psychiatric department  at a distinguished private university, one person, and  he comes in and he tells the defense counsel, now I'm  going to explain to you what all these terms mean.  There are lots of tests. I'll tell you about each of\\n \\n\\n these tests. And I'm going to have the same meeting\\n\\n\\n\\n with the prosecution later on. You can ask me anything\\n\\n you want and then I'm going to testify. I'm not sure\\n\\n what my opinion is yet, but I'll give my opinion. But\\n\\n here -- here's the basis for -- for my opinion, and I\\n\\n want you to ask any questions you want about what these\\n\\n tests mean.\\n\\n Is -- is that sufficient?</p><p> Suppose -</p><p> Well, if Ake says that you\\n\\n have a right to meaningful assistance from a -- from a\\n\\n psychiatrist, you, the defense, and then over time it\\n\\n becomes clear to us that that psychiatrist must be --\\n\\n must -- must be retained for the benefit of the defense\\n\\n only, is that a new clearly established holding, or is\\n\\n it simply a refinement of a clearly established right\\n\\n that was set forth in Ake?\\n\\n \\n42  The -- the Petitioner's counsel didn't seem  to want to embrace that. So then if -- gave us the  impression that if it's ambiguous, he loses, but I'm not  sure that's the case.</p><p> What was the case where we  said that? I think you're right.</p><p> Could he have been  consulted by either or both sides privately to  prepare -- prepare the examination?</p><p> And -- and if he had met  with the prosecution, would that have been a violation  of -- of -- of his ethical obligations?</p><p> Well, you usually meet  with your expert and go over the testimony with care.  Did that happen here, or could that happen here?</p><p> Right.</p><p> Suppose you have a single,  court-appointed expert, and let's assume he's not paid  by the State; he or she is an outside expert. Can that  expert, ethically, under the ethical rules that apply to  psychiatrists, meet just with the defense and say, now,\\n \\n\\n you should be sure to do this, and then go meet just\\n\\n\\n\\n with the prosecution, or do both parties have to be\\n\\n present? Do -- do you know what their ethical duties\\n\\n are in this regard? I read the article by Dr. Stone and\\n\\n wasn't quite clear on this.</p><p> -- when we say it must be  a defense psychiatrist.</p><p> Sorry. Go ahead. I'm - I'm assuming that we find it ambiguous.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': '<p>And this quest for the --\\n\\n the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor seems to\\n\\n me to be a -- a meaningless quest. There\\'s no \"there\"\\n\\n there. It\\'s not like burglary where there\\'s a common\\n\\n law definition. You\\'ve got some core. This is a phrase\\n\\n that doesn\\'t have a common law counterpart. And if you\\n\\n look at all these State statutes and throw in all the\\n\\n Federal statutes that you can find that have some\\n\\n relation to this, what you have is a -- a big array of\\n\\n very disparate statutes.\\n\\n So this seems to me like a classic example\\n\\n of Congress saying, we have this category sexual abuse\\n\\n of a minor, and we know that there\\'s all this array of\\n\\n State laws. And so you, Attorney General, define what\\n\\n should be within this for immigration purposes.</p><p> Is it your understanding  anything other than -- if a stranger does anything to a  minor other than commit a rape, then that would not be  sexual abuse of a minor because the person wouldn\\'t be a  relative or an acquaintance?</p><p> I thought your definition  was it had to be a relative -- parent, relative, or  acquaintance; is that right?</p><p> Well -- but I would like to\\n\\n know why it makes sense, so something other than a\\n\\n citation of cases, why would Chevron deference be\\n\\n appropriate up to the point where Congress decides to\\n\\n use the same phrase in a criminal statute and then it\\n\\n disappears.</p><p> Can I take you back to  the -- the argument that Chevron isn\\'t appropriate here  because the definition applies in both the criminal and  the civil context? And that was the point that Judge  Sutton made in his dissent, and it has kind of a -- it\\'s  an appealing argument when you say it fast. But the  more I think of it, the less sense - (Laughter.)</p><p> -- the less sense it makes.  Now suppose that a -- there\\'s an ambiguous  phrase in an immigration statute, and it applies only in  the civil -- it applies only in immigration and has no  criminal -- has no criminal applications. And suppose  that in that situation it would be appropriate to use  Chevron, okay, and then later Congress uses the same  phrase in a criminal statute.  Does that mean that the Chevron  deference that was applied in the civil -- previously in\\n \\n\\n the civil context goes away?</p><p> I -- I don\\'t see anything\\n\\n odd about having the same phrase interpreted using a\\n\\n different methodology in a civil case and in a criminal\\n\\n case.</p><p> But you think that if we  look at this incredible array of State laws, it becomes  clear what Congress intended by \"sexual abuse of a  minor\"?</p><p> Suppose that there were\\n\\n no -- that the definition here -- the phrase here had no\\n\\n criminal application. So it applies purely in\\n\\n immigration; okay?</p><p> And you\\'re not asking us to\\n\\n overrule Chevron.</p><p> All right. So why wouldn\\'t\\n\\n this phrase, \"sexual abuse of a minor,\" be a phrase that\\n\\n is sufficiently ambiguous to justify Chevron? Now, in\\n\\n order to get around that, do you have to invoke\\n\\n something like the rule of lenity?</p><p> So that -- that is not an\\n\\n ambiguous phrase by itself, \"sexual abuse of a minor\"?</p>', 'JUSTICE BREYER': '<p>No, but it is -- but it\\'s  why I think people are discussing it and I may have -</p><p> It\\'s quite complicated,\\n \\n\\n which I agree. But do I understand the situation\\n\\n31\\n\\n correctly? In mid 1990s, Congress passed a law in\\n\\n immigration statute, which is this 1101(a)(43), which\\n\\n lists about 30 or 40 crimes. And it says if the person\\n\\n has committed one of those, goodbye, and the Attorney\\n\\n General can\\'t stop it; is that right?</p><p> Unless everyone is.</p><p> It would, but there\\'s no\\n \\n\\n acquaintance.\\n\\n50</p><p> That\\'s my question.</p><p> If -- of course. If  somebody meets someone at a bar and doesn\\'t even know  them and -- and gets the person drunk and they go home  and they have sex, all right, that would sound much more  like sexual abuse of a minor than a -- a senior in  college dating and living with a -- a sophomore. Okay?</p><p> -- if I go read that, I\\'ll  see that there are things that couldn\\'t possibly apply.  That was your second. And I think you were going to  make a third. Was there a third? I want to know -</p><p> -- it would be because if  you go read the thing, 1140 -- is it 1143 or whatever - 2243 -</p><p> And you said one, because  there\\'s no cross-reference, so I got that one. You said  two -</p><p> Okay. So was there\\n\\n anything else? Because what I asked -- I wanted my\\n\\n first question, which you probably don\\'t remember now.\\n\\n But -- but I wanted to know why don\\'t just look at 1143,\\n\\n that\\'s the end of it; okay?</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> But you\\'ve just listed  things that we seem to be able to know just as well as\\n \\n\\n they.\\n\\n41</p><p> And they see some words  over here in Part  on page 3860. And they know, but we  wouldn\\'t know, that if you interpret it one way rather  than another, it\\'s going to be much harder to do the  thing as a practical matter that they have over there on  page 842. All right? They\\'ll know that; we won\\'t know.</p><p> What he\\'s saying -- I think  what the question is, is this: There are many  agencies -- Social Security -- that have statutes that  are incredibly detailed and have to do rather directly  with how this program is being administered.</p><p> -- which don\\'t use cross  references.</p><p> -- I can list  or ,  including deceit, rape, murder, a whole bunch in this  statute -</p><p> Oddly enough -</p><p> Okay. When they stuck in\\n\\n those words in this long list of crimes, some of which\\n\\n have cross references and some of which, like in that\\n\\n very section, murder, rape, deceit, et cetera, do not.\\n\\n At the time they did that, in 1996 -- I think it was\\n\\n \\'96, or maybe \\'95 -- there was on the books a Federal\\n\\n statute which had been passed in 1986. And that Federal\\n\\n statute, by some amazing coincidence, which was a\\n\\n criminal law, is entitled sexual abuse of a minor. And\\n\\n then it has a definition.\\n\\n So why not? And think when they use the\\n\\n \\n32  same word to do about the same thing, list a crime, they  meant to pick up the same definition, QED. End of case.  All right? Now, why not?</p><p> But what happened at that\\n\\n time is they stuck in the words \"sexual abuse of a\\n\\n minor.\"</p><p> You don\\'t have to accept my  view. My -- I may be the only one with this view, but  it -- and I\\'m curious to know what you actually think  about it. You have cases here a lot.  Chevron is not the tax code. We are not - it is not a rule of tax law. It is a general kind of  standard which has judges asking what Congress would  have thought about a question they never thought about,  which is what kind of deference should a court give to  an agency interpretation, and the answer will vary  depending upon statute.  I would not even give you this lecture were  it not for the case that I believe this Court wrote this\\n \\n  view into its opinion in Mead, which I think is pretty  good law. And so if you\\'re asking the question what  would a reasonable legislature think about that  question, which he never thought of, it\\'s surprising to  me that he would think prosecutors should have deference  as to what the statute that they are prosecuting  somebody under means. I would find that surprising.  I would find surprising some aspects of  immigration law where the result is just about as bad.  The result is they leave without any discretion to keep  them here. And then I\\'d proceed case by case.  But I\\'m not asking what I think. I already  know.

Because the first thing you said to  me was that you agree that the first thing that has to  be done is to define a generic offense.</p><p> Mr. Kedem, you have here --\\n\\n you have a federal statute. You have the Model Penal\\n\\n Code, which goes the same way. You have 30-plus State\\n\\n laws. So at the least, am I right that -- that you\\n\\n concede that you can't win unless Chevron applies; is\\n\\n that correct?</p><p> You think it's unambiguous,\\n\\n this kind of pragmatic construction about -- what did\\n\\n you say -- like power differentials --</p><p> I -- I guess I don't\\n\\n understand that. You're saying that it would be the --\\n\\n the clearly better reading to go -- to -- to say\\n\\n notwithstanding the Federal statute, notwithstanding\\n\\n 30-plus State statutes, notwithstanding the Model Penal\\n\\n Code, we just know that when somebody talks about sexual\\n\\n \\n34  abuse of a minor, they're talking about age  with a  three-year differential?</p><p> But why would you think  that, Mr. Fisher? I mean, there -- in this statute,  there are loads of cross-references. And this one is  not a cross-reference. So doesn't that tell us  something?</p><p> I'm -</p><p> So Justice Alito was  suggesting that, in this case, we shouldn't do that at  all. So you disagree there. And then Justice Alito  said, in this case you just have to think like, what  does the BIA think about this?</p><p> But you said to me, even  without deference, you win. So -- so you're taking a  very different view than Justice Alito is. You're  saying that what the BIA interpretation was is the best  understanding of the generic offense.</p><p> Do you have any further\\n\\n views of what the generic offense is? Are there other\\n\\n elements of the generic offense that you're willing to\\n\\n tell us you think? I mean usually, in these cases,\\n\\n first we define the generic offense, and then we see\\n\\n whether the State statute in question fits within that\\n\\n or doesn't.\\n\\n And so what is the generic offense? It's\\n\\n under . Anything else?</p><p> I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher. You  just said something that I think you did not say in your  briefs, so let me ask you about that.  You just gave us your definition of what the\\n \\n\\n generic offense is. It's understand . Because I\\n\\n\\n\\n understood in your briefs you just said whatever the\\n\\n generic offense is, it doesn't include this activity.\\n\\n But do you have a definition of what the generic offense\\n\\n is? And if so, did you just say it?</p><p> It's really like a freshman  in college going out with a junior in college.</p><p> -- and saying whatever a\\n\\n State does goes. So I thought that that was sort of the\\n\\n antithesis of the generic offense approach.</p><p> Yes. But you're carving out\\n\\n one element, which is the age element --</p><p> In other words, you're just  saying, well, it's whatever the States consider illegal,  when the whole idea of a generic crime is that it's not\\n \\n\\n just anything that's illegal, it's the prototypical\\n\\n\\n\\n case, even though that differs from what some States do.</p><p> I don't really understand  that -- that canon, because that canon would suggest  that we never give the BIA deference as to its  interpretation of this statute. And, in fact, when it  comes to noncriminal things, we give the BIA very  substantial deference.</p><p> The lenity purposes really  demands grievous ambiguity, and but there's some sense  in which there's -- there's a of lack clarity, a lack of  clear meaning that allows the Court to decide what the  best interpretation of the language is.</p><p> It works -- it works, if you  think that ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean the same  thing for Chevron purposes and for lenity purposes.</p><p> Well, Mr. Kedem, you don't  disagree, do you, with the premise that the first thing  that we should do is to define the generic crime; is  that right?</p><p> Are you suggesting,  Mr. Fisher, that if we turn Chevron off, we have to turn  lenity on? Couldn't there be a middle ground between  the two; in other words, some space where you say,  because of this -- the -- the criminal application of  this statute, we don't apply ordinary Chevron deference,  but at the same time, we don't go straight into the kind  of grievous ambiguity that -- that triggers lenity?  There's some middle area where the Court gets to decide  just what is -- it thinks is the best construction of  the statute?</p><p> Okay. So you say that's  step one. And then you say, well, you define  the generic -- in this case you say the generic crime is  whatever is illegal under State law. That's one of  your -</p><p> Yeah. So that seems to be  like just not what generic crimes are.</p><p> I'm asking for ordinary -</p><p> The term -</p><p> So the -- the dictionary  definition that you pull out is illegal sex acts\\n \\n\\n performed against a minor by a parent, guardian,\\n\\n47\\n\\n relative, or acquaintance. Is that the one?</p><p> Yeah. But you're not using\\n\\n by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance; is\\n\\n that right?</p><p> Okay. So the answer is no.  So what -- what do you rely on? What are  the sources that you rely on to generate this  definition? Because you're not relying on the Federal  statute. You're not relying on the most common State  statutes. You're not relying on the other Federal  statute that the BIA relied on. What are you relying on  to generate this definition?</p><p> So, Mr. Kedem, Mr. Fisher  said and I just want to make sure that this is right,  that you no longer rely on the statute that the BIA  relied on; is that correct?</p><p> No, no, no, no, no. But\\n\\n this -- this limits it to those relationships.</p><p> That's what this does --</p><p> Okay. Anything else?\\n\\n Dictionary definition.

It's all right to allow them\\n\\n \\n\\n to intervene as a party? Because there is a case or\\n\\n31\\n\\n controversy. They don't -- you know, they wouldn't\\n\\n satisfy Article III standing, but they don't have to,\\n\\n according to you. So their views are valuable, their\\n\\n participation in, you know, depositions, discovery, all\\n\\n might help the Court, so why not?</p><p> Well, no. No. No.  I know that, but that's -- that's -- those cases are  distinct, in that the Court is saying they need not  inquire further because those are separate parties, but  they're all seeking the same relief. It may be  necessary at some point for the Court to inquire further  if it determines that the party is seeking to exercise  authority beyond Article III.  Sure, you don't have to decide cases that  might never come up or issues that might never come up,  but I don't see how that helps you.</p><p> Well, I -- I may  not. What -- what is the -- the legal case you have  where the Court has granted judgment in favor of a party\\n \\n47  without standing? Other than treble pitch or putting  that aside.</p><p> No. With respect to\\n\\n a particular party, you don't -- you don't just ask is\\n\\n there an injury.

Plaintiff  intervenors.</p><p> And would they lack\\n\\n Article III standing?</p><p> No, but that's not an - that's not an Article III question. That's a merits  question. That's the scope of the claim.</p><p> Right, right.</p><p> Could I come back to Justice  Kennedy's question?  Can you give me a real case, where there  is -- where -- where you believe that the requirements  of (a)() are met, but there is not -- there was not  Article III standing?</p><p> Mr. Katyal, I was trying to\\n\\n understand the -- the universe of cases in which a\\n\\n party -- someone seeking intervention would be able to\\n\\n come in under (a)() by claiming an interest relating\\n\\n to the property or transaction, but would not be able to\\n\\n claim injury in fact. And I -- I found it difficult to\\n\\n identify that universe of cases. And then I said, well,\\n\\n this is one of them; this case must be one of them. But\\n\\n \\n  actually, it doesn't seem -- it seems to me that Laroe  has Article III standing.  Now Laroe may not be the -- may -- may not  be entitled to recover under the Takings Clause, but why  is there not Article III standing here? If -- if it - in fact, Laroe has a mortgage where an -- is an  equitable owner of the property, isn't that enough for  injury in fact?</p><p> Why not?</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>We don't have to go into  that here.</p><p> Oh, sure.</p><p> I see your point.</p><p> -- take position to  issue -- ask for subpoenas and so forth.</p><p> Okay. That brings me back\\n\\n to my original question. Fine. A defendant can go and\\n\\n get subpoenas and so forth, but if he has a\\n\\n counterclaim, that's different, then he has to show\\n\\n standing.\\n\\n So why don't we apply the same standard to\\n\\n the intervenors? The intervenors have to be like\\n\\n defendants in respect to intervening on the -- on either\\n\\n side. They can get subpoenas, et cetera, but if they\\n\\n want something that somebody else doesn't want in this\\n\\n case, then they have to have standing.</p><p> That gives the defendant  standing to -</p><p> What about when they ask\\n\\n for a subpoena to be enforced? I can't go in and -- you\\n\\n can't -- people can't just go in randomly and say I'd\\n\\n like to have a subpoena enforced against so and so.</p><p> No, not the difficulty of\\n\\n writing an opinion. I want to know is there such a\\n\\n think as defendants having or not having standing, and\\n\\n if there is such a thing, why and how. And if you don't\\n\\n know the answer right away, have you ever read anything\\n\\n on the topic, and what would you recommend?</p><p> Can we write an opinion and\\n\\n say the only people that have to have stand -- I mean, I\\n\\n don't know how to write this opinion unless you're\\n\\n talking about standing in general. Yes or no on that.\\n\\n And why can a defendant invoke the court's power on\\n\\n appeal -- for example, subpoenas, discovery -- where\\n\\n defendants all the time invoke the court's power, and\\n\\n how can they do that if they don't have -- I don't even\\n\\n know how to phrase the question but you see what I'm\\n\\n \\n\\n driving at.\\n\\n40</p><p> I mean, I don't see any\\n\\n more with the defendant, how you can find a defendant\\n\\n without standing on that basis? I mean, the reason I\\n\\n find it relevant is because I think the other side is\\n\\n arguing that an intervenor has to have standing in the\\n\\n sense that a defendant has to have standing, at least\\n\\n when you intervene on the side of the defendant, as most\\n\\n do.</p><p> How does a defendant have\\n\\n standing? How does that work? What the government says\\n\\n is a defendant has standing because the judgment in the\\n\\n case may affect an interest of the defendant, a\\n\\n significant interest. Is that right?</p><p> What kind of rule - probably not -- I -- I don't know. Where I draw - begin to get a kind of blank is defendant's standing. I\\n \\n  can see defendant's standing on appeal, et cetera, but  forget it. What about on the initial -- when does - are there any cases? Are there -- is there a good  article? When does a defendant have or lack standing?</p><p> On the defendant's side --\\n\\n I mean, on the -- why can't we just say simple? It's --\\n\\n defendants are there because the court might affect\\n\\n their -- their behavior, do something they don't want to\\n\\n do or -- or affect their property in a way they don't\\n\\n want. And an intervenor on the defendant's side, why\\n\\n not just interpret the rule that way? That's what the\\n\\n government says. It has to show the same.\\n\\n An intervenor on the plaintiff's side\\n\\n doesn't have to show anything, unless they want\\n\\n something -- other than the rule, I mean, you have --\\n\\n unless they want something that the plaintiff doesn't\\n\\n want. That's where I started. The government is saying\\n\\n interpret the rule this way and you object to that\\n\\n because?</p><p> They may disagree -</p><p> -- wrong with doing this.\\n\\n Say -- think if a -- a party wants a court to do\\n\\n something. Now, you can't invoke a court's power to do\\n\\n something, including an appellate court, unless you have\\n\\n standing. To say an intervenor, who wants the court to\\n\\n do no more than what the plaintiff, or in an appropriate\\n\\n case, the defendant, wants them to do does not need\\n\\n standing.\\n\\n But where an intervener wants a court to do\\n\\n something different, then -- then he does need standing.\\n\\n In which case, it would save the court lots of trouble.\\n\\n If there are many interveners, you wouldn't have to look\\n\\n into the standing -- or you would, if, and only if, they\\n\\n want the court to do something different.</p><p> -- perhaps with the  argument. The lawyer, amazingly, thinks he's a better  lawyer than the one who's already there, and so he  thinks he can make a better argument.</p><p> This very case. This very  case, he may want nothing different. All he may want is  that the town gives the plaintiff the money, and then he  will make his own case to say, I'm equitably entitled.</p><p> This case -</p><p> But if he doesn't want  anything different than what they've already asked for,  why does Article III insist that he have standing?</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>Did your -- I think we  were just told that we think we have -- in fact, these  courts have limited .</p><p> Are there cases in which  courts have controlled (a)() intervenors?</p><p> Which are stringent.</p><p> You would have to meet  the (a) requirements, of course.</p><p> Suppose somebody was a  plaintiff and was dismissed for lack of standing. That  same person could come back into the case as an  intervenor on -- on -- that's your position.</p><p> Could Congress -- could  Congress enact a statute that provides for intervention  of right for someone who doesn't satisfy Article III?  There are -- there are several statutes that do provide  for intervention of right.</p><p> Can I ask you the same  question that I asked Mr. Katyal? Could Congress pass a  statute that said give someone a right to intervene,  someone who would not have Article III standing?</p><p> There are -- there are\\n \\n\\n several statutes.</p><p> It sets up a difference  between intervening on the defendant's side and the  plaintiff's side. Intervening on the defendant's side  under your scheme, that's easy, but not on the  plaintiff's side. And why should there be that  disuniformity?</p><p> How about permissive\\n\\n intervenors?</p><p> You're saying the\\n\\n intervenor must have the same standing as a plaintiff\\n\\n would have. And that hasn't been the understanding in\\n\\n the courts or the commentators.\\n\\n You're probably familiar with the\\n\\n intervention commentary by David Shapiro in which he\\n\\n said, it should go without saying, it must be understood\\n\\n that there is a difference between the -- the question\\n\\n whether one is a proper plaintiff in the -- or defendant\\n\\n in an initial action, and the question whether one is\\n\\n entitled to intervene.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': \"<p>The question is whether a  plaintiff can seek a judgment against a defendant in  someone else's name. Generally not, right? That - that's not a trick question.</p><p> I -</p><p> I'm sorry for  interrupting, counselor. If you would just answer my  question, I would be grateful.  If a plaintiff seeks a judgment in its own  name, can't seek it for an intervenor, agree?</p><p> Or just a judgment in its  favor.</p><p> I appreciate the candor of  that concession.</p><p> I'll let you go.</p><p> Okay. So if an intervenor  then seeks a judgment in its name, generally speaking,  that's asking for relief beyond that which the plaintiff  has standing itself to provide, right?</p><p> Would you agree though  that if an intervenor did seek relief in its own name,  that that would be relief beyond that which the  plaintiff would be entitled to provide?  I mean, after all, plaintiff normally  doesn't have standing to seek a judgment in someone  else's name. So would you agree in the normal case that  we'd have a problem here?</p><p> Counsel, on -- on that\\n\\n score, why isn't that exactly the case we have here?\\n\\n The Plaintiff in this case, by way of relief, seeks a\\n\\n money damages for the taking. All right. That's his\\n\\n complaint, page 122 of the Joint Appendix. Your client,\\n\\n page 162, wants damages for itself. That's something\\n\\n that the Plaintiff could not have had standing to obtain\\n\\n for your client.\\n\\n Why isn't that a form of additional relief\\n\\n where an intervenor wishes a judgment against the\\n\\n defendant directly in its favor that would be\\n\\n enforceable through all the mechanisms of post-judgment,\\n\\n garnishment, liens, et cetera, and would offer your\\n\\n client claim preclusion effect, not just nonmutual issue\\n\\n preclusion, for example? Seems to me like that is a\\n\\n different form of relief, isn't it?</p><p> Is there any relief you're\\n\\n seeking at this stage?</p><p> So you're disclaiming the\\n\\n relief sought in your complaint.</p><p> Well, except for the\\n\\n complaint expressly says that.</p><p> To the extent he's seeking  relief only in his own name, an as-applied challenge.</p><p> So as I understand it,  you're saying, well, all right, Rule  is old and Lujan  is new, but let's match them up, and any ambiguity we  ought to just ignore or construe in your favor because  of the Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance. But the  upshot of applying the doctrine here to avoid the  question whether intervenors have to have Article III  standing would be that we would have to ask the  Article III question effectively through the guise,  admittedly, of Rule  in every single case.  So to avoid the constitutional question  once, we have to ask it every single time hereafter.</p><p> Let's use a hypothetical.</p><p> Is there -- is there a  precedent -</p><p> -- for applying that  doctrine in quite that way?</p><p> A -- a number of federal  prisoners are similarly situated with respect to a claim  that they're not being provided food consistent with  their religious beliefs. One -- one brings a claim. He  wants relief as to him, because that's what he can seek  relief for, right?</p><p> Okay. Then we have 80  join him. Can they join him, so long as they simply  say, we want him to get his meal, or if -- if they seek  meals in their own name, a judgment running as to them,  do they have to show standing at that stage?</p><p> Ms. Harrington, I really  get confused when you invoke the Doctrine of  Constitutional Avoidance.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>But why is there -</p><p> -- do you think there is a  real difference, Mr. Katyal, between claims in relief on  the one hand, in which case, yes, you need standing too,  and everything else on the other hand, in which case,  there's somebody with standing who has those claims, who  seeks that relief. So the court is doing exactly what  the court has authority to do, but this intervenor can  contribute to the way the court is thinking about the\\n \\n\\n case.</p><p> But why -</p><p> Well, that's great. I mean,\\n\\n \\n  given that that's true, do you think -- are you saying  that Congress had it in mind to track the requirements  of standing, whatever they turned out to be? Because,  of course, the Standing Doctrine in 1966 was nothing  like what it is now.</p><p> I think it is very odd that  you can be an actual party. And presumably, you can do  all of these things, you can do -- do your own  discovery, you can do -- and -- and that's fine with  you, but if you're named as an intervenor, then it  becomes not fine.</p><p> So putting -- putting  intervenors aside, suppose ten plaintiffs got together  and brought a suit, so they were all joined in the same  suit. And the district court satisfied itself that one  of those plaintiffs had standing, that there was a  proper case in controversy before the court, that nobody\\n \\n  else was asking for anything else or making any other  claims.

Maybe outside of the context  of this suit? I think there may be Article III  standing. What -- is there a practical illustration you  can give us for why it's very important to allow this  intervenor under -- under the rules, even though there's  no standing?</p><p> Well, I -- I -- it's\\n \\n\\n almost as if -- I had the same trouble with -- as\\n\\n\\n\\n Justice Alito did. I don't know why this party doesn't\\n\\n have standing, because at the end of the day, if there's\\n\\n a regulatory taking, he can say, and incidentally, that\\n\\n taking award is mostly mine.\\n\\n Now, do we just take this case on the\\n\\n assumption that there's no standing?</p><p> On Justice Alito's point,\\n\\n if, as a practical matter, you have an interest to\\n\\n protect, that almost sounds like a shorthand for\\n\\n standing.</p><p> Well, it's got to be  conditioned on there being a party with standing  remaining in the suit.</p><p> That will solve that  problem.</p><p> But -- but we're talking  about mandatory intervention. The district - intervention must -- the -- the court must permit anyone  to intervene. And then there's this requirement of - of there be a practical interest and so forth.  It seems to me you're going to have to -- in  order just to protect the courts against parties coming  in, you're going to have to make an inquiry that looks  very much like standing, anyway.</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>Let's assume, for the  sake of argument, that -- because I think, as I read the  district court's opinion here, they assumed you were  asking for judgment in your name, because they were  treating you as a contract vendor or vendee, and they  were saying, you don't have the right to have a judgment  in your name.  Would that holding have been wrong, absent  your current concession that -- that you are not seeking  money in your own name, but just a payment of money?</p><p> I have asked a different  hypothetical. I don't know that the court below  understood your claim that way. So when it ruled, it  ruled understanding that you were following your  complaint and seeking a -- money in your name. You  disavow that in the Second Circuit. They accepted that  disavowal, and they've ruled a slightly different way.  I'm saying, if you hadn't, would this be the same case?</p><p> And what would happen if  it were a different case?</p><p> So your rule is always  on a motion to intervene, there is a standing inquiry.  The standing inquiry is whether or not you're asking for  relief different from someone with a case or  controversy.</p><p> Yes.</p><p> We've said it with\\n\\n respect to union members who we've permitted to\\n\\n intervene, even though the union has all of the claimed\\n\\n contract rights.</p><p> Mr Katyal, I am totally\\n\\n confused with the permissive and -- or automatic. If\\n\\n it's okay to do all of this with permissive intervenors\\n\\n and all of the discovery and other burdens that you're\\n\\n talking about, why isn't it okay to do it with automatic\\n\\n intervenors who are limited to only the claims of relief\\n\\n that the plaintiff has asked for?</p><p> Why -- why is there some\\n\\n sort of added burden with respect to automatic that\\n\\n doesn't exist with respect to permissive?</p><p> But there's -</p><p> -- that step that you  keep referring to which doesn't make any sense under  Article III, which is the one about whether the existing\\n \\n\\n party is adequately protecting your interests.</p><p> I -- let's assume\\n\\n they've hired the best lawyer in the world, and they've\\n\\n made every conceivable argument, but you're still a\\n\\n contract vendor or -- with the kind of potential injury\\n\\n that the others assume would give you standing. Why is\\n\\n it that we then read Article III into Rule ?</p><p> Why did they bother?</p><p> I -- if -- if the only\\n\\n issue is standing, totally different language was used\\n\\n by the rule drafters. And I don't think they track very\\n\\n well, because to require standing, you need immediacy of\\n\\n effect. And in a lot of these intervenor cases, it's\\n\\n very clear that part of the interest in the property is\\n\\n a contingent one. If the person loses the property, my\\n\\n interest will be destroyed. That's very contingent and\\n\\n not likely to permit standing in a lot of situations.</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Well, I mean, are  you saying it would have been hard to formulate? Are  you suggesting that someone facing this sentence that  Mr. Davila is facing would say, well, let's not do that,  let's not raise an ineffective assistance of appellate  counsel or somewhere and said, because it's just too  hard to formulate that claim?  These are situations where the defendant is  facing capital punishment where they are going to raise\\n \\n  every possible claim they can, and I don't know why it  would be terribly different for defendants facing life  in prison or further sentences.</p><p> One -- one\\n\\n significant distinction, of course, is that these claims\\n\\n of appellate assistance -- ineffective appellate\\n\\n assistance of counsel, under the logic can be raised in\\n\\n every State. Martinez, Trevino, it's only where the\\n\\n State has funneled the decisions to collateral review.\\n\\n Appellate claims like this, you know,\\n\\n obviously can't be brought on appeal in every State, and\\n\\n so this would arise, in terms of evaluating the\\n\\n statistics, it would be many, many times the numbers of\\n\\n Martinez claims that you see, and we see -- and -- and\\n\\n there are now an awful lot of Martinez claims anyway.</p><p> I -- I've got - I've got to -- do -- for them to raise the appellate -</p><p> I'm sorry to cut you  off, but I -- I understand that, but that's going to be  true in every State, right? It's going to be -- you're  going to have the same difficulty of raising  ineffectiveness of appellate counsel on direct review in  every -- every State.</p><p> Yeah. Martinez, one  of the important considerations at least for some in  Martinez is that it is narrow. It's only where the  State has funneled the ineffective assistance at trial  claims to collateral review.</p><p> Are there hearings  in those cases -</p><p> -- cranting the  necessity for the court to evaluate the claims before  they decide not to grant the -- the allegation -</p><p> The court presumably  has to read the -- the filings in the case to decide  that the claim is not substantial, correct?</p><p> So -- so the number  that are granted really isn't the consideration we're\\n \\n  looking to, is it?

The case is submitted.  (Whereupon, at :01 p.m., the case in the\\n \\n above-entitled matter was submitted.)</p><p> We'll hear argument  next in Case -6219, Davila v. Davis.  Mr. Kretzer.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH KRETZER  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</p><p> If it's going to be  raised in 50 States rather than two?</p><p> And wouldn't that be  pertinent in assessing the significance of the number of  times this issue is going to be raised?</p><p> One -- one thing a\\n\\n \\n\\n good appellate lawyer will do is pare down the issues\\n\\n\\n\\n that are presented on appeal, even if they think that\\n\\n some of those issues have merit. I mean, if you have\\n\\n six issues that you think you can argue credibly before\\n\\n the -- before the appellate court, you may decide it\\n\\n would be much better to focus that court on the two or\\n\\n three strongest issues, that adding the others will, in\\n\\n fact, dilute from the value of that.\\n\\n So when you have these -- I'm not talking\\n\\n about this particular case. But in general, when you\\n\\n have the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate\\n\\n counsel, it's sometimes easy in retrospect to say, well,\\n\\n here's an issue that, you know, maybe -- the appellate\\n\\n counsel, in the exercise of discretion, thought it was\\n\\n like number  in the order of -- of strength. And you\\n\\n look back and in hindsight you say, well, he should have\\n\\n made more of that, and it's not even mentioned at all in\\n\\n the appellate brief.\\n\\n I mean, I know there's also issues of trial\\n\\n strategy, but it seems it's more typical in an appellate\\n\\n case that you have -- you know, you leave things off the\\n\\n table. Is -- is that going to present a problem, in\\n\\n your view, in evaluating the effectiveness of appellate\\n\\n counsel?</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>Yeah. But the ineffective\\n\\n assistance of appellate counsel would be based on any\\n\\n type of error that occurred at trial.\\n\\n So here you have a jury instruction error.\\n\\n But if we agree with you, it would apply to the\\n\\n \\n\\n erroneous introduction of evidence, to the -- to\\n\\n\\n\\n improper statements made in closing, to any type of\\n\\n trial error, any type of constitutional trial error you\\n\\n can dream of. So whatever the statistics are on\\n\\n Martinez, this goes way, way, way beyond Martinez. And\\n\\n Trevino.</p><p> But Martinez concerned\\n\\n ineffective assistance of counsel in a limited number of\\n\\n States, and Trevino arguably extended it to a few\\n\\n additional States. But if we accept your argument, it\\n\\n applies everywhere, and it's not limited to ineffective\\n\\n assistance of counsel. It is -- it applies to every\\n\\n single -- every single type of error that could occur at\\n\\n trial.</p><p> Right. And the Federal\\n\\n habeas court is going to have to analyze that, which\\n\\n means the Federal habeas court is going to have to\\n\\n analyze all of these alleged trial errors that were\\n\\n never previously raised in the State court.</p><p> Well, they'd have to find\\n\\n something that they can argue in the Federal habeas was\\n\\n an error, but procedural default would be out the\\n\\n window.</p><p> What concerns me about your  position is that it seems to blast an enormous hole in  the doctrine of procedural default. Unlike Martinez and  unlike Trevino, which were cabined, it -- it seems to  me, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, that if we agree  with your position, then anything that -- that an  attorney in Federal habeas can examine the trial record,  and if that attorney finds anything that seems to be an  error, it can be raised in Federal habeas, even if there  was no objection at the time of trial, it wasn't raised  on direct appeal, it wasn't raised in a State collateral\\n \\n\\n proceeding. That's where this is going.\\n\\n\\n\\n And if it's an -- if the underlying error is\\n\\n ineffective assistance of counsel, well, whatever it is,\\n\\n all of that will be evaluated by the Federal habeas\\n\\n court outside of AEDPA. That's where this is going.\\n\\n So this is an enormous hole.\\n\\n Am I not -- isn't that where this -- isn't\\n\\n that what this means? Because the -- the argument in\\n\\n Federal habeas would be there was cause because counsel\\n\\n was ineffective at the collateral -- State collateral\\n\\n proceeding, and this counsel was ineffective at the\\n\\n State collateral proceeding because there was\\n\\n ineffective assistance on direct appeal. And then\\n\\n counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because there\\n\\n was an error at trial.\\n\\n So the Federal habeas court has to make all\\n\\n of those determinations, and if the court -- the --\\n\\n which means the court is going to have to look at\\n\\n whether or not there was an error at trial and, in doing\\n\\n that, it is not going to be asking whether a -- whether\\n\\n a State court reasonably rejected the claim because it\\n\\n was never presented to the State court. So it's going\\n\\n to be de novo review.</p><p> Why will it be a small\\n\\n thing? If you can identify looking back that there was\\n\\n \\n46  an objection that should have been granted, and it might  have -- might have led to a different result at trial  but it wasn't raised on direct appeal, then there's  going to be ineffective assistance of -- of appellate  counsel.</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>Say, so what -- you started  to say this, but I guess Martinez itself, one of the  concerns was that any mistake that the trial -- that the  trial attorney makes -- and normally, by the way, you - you don't make ineffective assistance counsel claims on  direct appeal, I don't think. It's usually the same  lawyer. You have to make it in State habeas.  Okay. What would happen would be that the  defendant with a new lawyer in Federal habeas would go  through every mistake that the trial court made, that  the -- that the trial lawyer made, and say it was  ineffective assistance of counsel. And so the judge  would have to do just what Justice Alito said, though  perhaps a few fewer States.  So, you started to say this. What's the  answer? It's five years. To what extent has the\\n \\n\\n Martinez claim proved a burden on Federal court? Is\\n\\n\\n\\n there any empirical information?</p><p> Well, you'd have to show,  wouldn't you, that -- that the -- any reasonable lawyer  would have raised this -- would have won this claim and  made a difference -- raised it, won it, and it would  have made a difference.</p><p> Yeah, but that's not that  easy to show, just as it's not that easy to show in a - in the -- in the same situation in the trial.</p><p> No -</p><p> Well, yes, that's true, but  how many are in the other? How many -- what's the  number in the other? What is the -- what is the number?  I mean, the norm, I thought, was that you raise an  ineffective-assistance-counsel claim in the collateral\\n \\n\\n proceeding.\\n\\n38\\n\\n So how many States, actually, does Martinez\\n\\n not apply to? Do you know that? I -- I doubt that\\n\\n it's, you know, a small number, but I'm pretty certain\\n\\n it isn't every State.\\n\\n Do we have any idea here?</p><p> What I -- I asked you\\n\\n really, is there any empirical information? Because, of\\n\\n course, I think you probably think no. But the other\\n\\n side may think yes. And so that's what I would like to\\n\\n know, is there any -- anyplace I could look to find out\\n\\n whether it has proved to be a burden or not, where there\\n\\n have been a lot of claims or not?</p><p> I don't think that's -- I\\n\\n think, as I'm gathering Justice Alito's point -- and I\\n\\n think it's an -- you know, it's an interesting point and\\n\\n important, what is ineffective assistance of appellate\\n\\n counsel? I mean, I understand somewhat ineffective\\n\\n assistance of trial counsel, but it can't just be an\\n\\n ordinary mistake. It has to be something rather\\n\\n special.</p><p> Now, is ineffective\\n\\n assistance of appellate counsel the same, or is an\\n\\n \\n\\n appellate counsel ineffective whenever the appellate\\n\\n\\n\\n counsel fails to present a claim that the trial judge\\n\\n made a mistake in the trial?</p><p> So it's very hard to see\\n\\n when it would be ineffective assistance when there\\n\\n wasn't also ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\\n\\n What is such a case? I mean, I'm just probably missing\\n\\n it, but what -- what is a case where -- where there's\\n\\n ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but not\\n\\n ineffective assistance of trial counsel? What is that\\n\\n case?</p><p> So then why didn't the\\n\\n trial counsel -- this -- I can see that this was a very\\n\\n important matter for this particular defendant, but then\\n\\n why wasn't the trial counsel ineffective?</p><p> Well, what about saying  this: Suppose we said, yes, there is -- it's the same  situation, you know, you have ineffective assistance - you have ineffective appellate counsel. Well,  obviously, you can't raise it because he was  ineffective. So you never had a shot at it. It's  catch-. Same with the trial counsel.  But those things, it's very unlikely that  you're going to have ineffective assistant of appellate  counsel where there wasn't also the ineffective  assistance of trial counsel. It's very hard to think of  such an instance. And just the bringing of an ordinary  mistake is failure to bring an ordinary mistake will  unlikely to be qualified.  Suppose we wrote that into the opinion or  the equivalent. What would you think of that?</p><p> The same question that I  had before. I -- I mean, every -- every instance in  which a trial counsel might have objected but didn't, in  principle, could be the subject of Martinez. I suppose  that's quite a few. I don't know there are any more or  any less. So what's actually happened? Is there any  information anywhere about whether -- any empirical  information about whether habeas courts, Federal habeas  courts, have been deluged, or have -- do we know?</p><p> Where?</p><p> Is it fair to say several  hundred a year have come up under Martinez out of -- out  of, roughly, how many habeas petitions? Out of fifty  thousand? I don't know. Hundred thousand? Forty  thousand?</p><p> All right. But several\\n\\n hundred a year. Now, is there a reason to think there\\n\\n would be more? I mean, after all, you know, I grant you\\n\\n it's slightly different, you're complaining here about a\\n\\n trial error that was raised and the judge wrongly\\n\\n decided it. And the counsel on appeal should have\\n\\n pointed that out, but he didn't. Just like you point\\n\\n out with the trial judge -- the trial lawyer should have\\n\\n raised, but he didn't. Very, very few are granted, very\\n\\n few. And here, I guess, very, very few would be\\n\\n granted. But the burden would be to read all those.\\n\\n Now, is it -- is it more, do you think? Why\\n\\n would it be more? I don't see why it would be more. It\\n\\n might be. I'm -- that's why I'm asking, though.</p><p> Yeah -</p><p> I -- I accept that, and  people raise all kinds of things in habeas. You know,  they're -- they're -- this is a -- district judges are  kept busy with these habeas petitions, I accept that.  That's why I'm -- I'll read the empirical -- I -- I'm  curious to know just what the situation is empirically.</p><p> The other side has been  brought out. I mean, there is the occasional claim  where let's suppose the appellate lawyer just really  didn't even bring an appeal. He had a two-page brief  and the trial was rife with errors and a serious  penalty. It was attached and -- and no relief  whatsoever. He can't bring that to any court. Do you  see that? That's the other side of it. Even if there  are only a few.</p><p> Yeah.</p><p> Actual innocence means he  was actually innocent.</p><p> Where -- where does it  exist?</p><p> He wasn't for it.\\n  (Laughter.)</p><p> He has to have -- he has to  have failed to do that, and -- or at least the State\\n \\n49  collateral review has to also have been inadequate. And  so we have to have a couple of situations where they are  both inadequate or you don't even get into the Federal  court. So the standard for winning, which you concede  is quite -- is very tough and -- but suppose it's met,  that's -- that's, of course, what's annoying on the  other side. Here is a person in jail forever or worse,  and the trial filled with errors and didn't have decent  counsel anywhere and what a mess. I mean, shouldn't  there be some remedy? And there is none. And that's  why Justice Scalia wrote that there's no way to stop  this extension.</p>\", 'JUSTICE GINSBURG': \"<p>But one thing that's the\\n\\n same is that the State habeas would be the first\\n\\n opportunity to raise this. You can't raise ineffective\\n\\n assistance of appellate counsel on the appeal. That's\\n\\n obvious. So your -- the -- the State habeas is the\\n\\n first time you could raise it.\\n\\n And in considering this question, I'm sure\\n\\n you anticipated this, Justice Scalia, in Martinez, said\\n\\n there's not a dime's worth of difference between an\\n\\n ineffective assistance of trial counsel -- the issue in\\n\\n Martinez -- and those where Petitioner claims his direct\\n\\n appeal counsel was ineffective.\\n\\n Was he wrong in thinking there's not a\\n\\n dime's worth of difference?</p><p> Why a new trial? Why\\n\\n isn't the consequence of ineffective assistance of\\n\\n appellate counsel not a new trial of the case, but just\\n\\n a new State court appeal?</p><p> If I may ask one question\\n\\n about your -- your bottom line. I think you said that\\n\\n if counsel had taken up -- challenged the instruction on\\n\\n direct appeal, it would have led to a new trial.</p><p> But in this actual case,\\n\\n didn't the district court hold that the ineffective\\n\\n assistance of appellate counsel argument, on the merits,\\n\\n it was insubstantial? And if -- if it was\\n\\n insubstantial, then we didn't -- we don't even have to\\n\\n get to the question you would like to present to us.\\n\\n Wasn't it an alternative holding that, in\\n\\n any case, this objection to the instruction was\\n\\n \\n\\n insubstantial?</p><p> You're not in Missouri --</p>\", 'JUSTICE GORSUCH': \"<p>But, counsel -</p><p> Sorry, counsel.  Just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's  point, I think you argued at page 228 of the Joint  Appendix that trial counsel's objection was not  sufficient to cover the charging error, and I think that  the Federal district court on habeas found the same  thing on page 366.  And so that raises, to my mind, a question  whether Martinez applies here. Couldn't -- couldn't  your client have brought a Martinez claim? And isn't  the Martinez rule premised on the idea you get one clear\\n \\n\\n shot at bringing the issue? And -- and maybe the\\n\\n\\n\\n absence of one clear shot here would bring you within\\n\\n the rule of Martinez, and that would take care of this\\n\\n case.\\n\\n What am I missing there?</p><p> And Coleman sets out the  general rule that ineffective assistance by counsel in  collateral review does not suffice to establish cause  for purposes of Federal habeas. That's the general  rule. And Martinez carves out a small exception for  when there wouldn't be any chance to raise an issue in  State court at all. And that doesn't apply here because  trial court counsel could have raised this issue. We  all admit that.\\n \\n  So when we -- when we overrule a precedent,  or part of a precedent, as I think you're effectively  asking us to do with Coleman, we normally don't just ask  about the merits. We also ask about the reliance  interest, the workability, whether the question is  statutory rather than constitutional. And I didn't see  you address any of those factors in your brief. And I'm  wondering what I'm supposed to make of that. Help me  out.</p><p> Counsel -</p><p> -- I don't know whether  we'd create a couple of strange incentives if -- if we  went down your road.  If procedural default by State habeas  counsel, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is  cause, I can see a world in which State habeas counsel  might have an incentive not to raise it, you know, might  actually be ineffective assistance of State habeas  counsel to raise the issue, because Federal habeas may  be more forgiving. So what do we about that problem,  number one?  And, number two, do we also create an  incentive for States to stop using collateral review to  test IAC claims? They don't have to do that. It's  generally thought to be favorable to defense that they  do do that, because it gives defense a chance to present  evidence and prepare and do things like that. Some\\n \\n55  States don't permit it. Oklahoma, my old jurisdiction,  it was very hard for defense counsel. And don't we  create an incentive to go back to that, the bad old  days? And -- and so by adding more procedure and  perfecting this, do we actually wind up hurting the  defense interests in this case?</p><p> Why? Why? If it's -- if  it's -- if it's the effective best strategy for your  client, I would think that's exactly what you'd do.</p><p> Counsel, we spent a lot of  time talking about Martinez, but one case we haven't  discussed is Coleman.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': \"<p>General, could I just -- I\\n\\n guess I got a little bit confused in your exchange with\\n\\n Justice Alito, because you had been pressing this is\\n\\n just going to be an infinitesimally small --\\n\\n infinitesimally small, I think that that was your\\n\\n phrase. And Justice Alito said he thought it would\\n\\n happen all the time, and then you said yes, and then you\\n\\n went back to infinitesimally small.\\n\\n So, which is it?</p><p> Right. Okay. I thought\\n\\n that his point was different, that it was actually not\\n\\n going to be infinitesimally small. But let's say that\\n\\n it is going to be pretty rare, as you say. You know,\\n\\n then I think it really is Justice Breyer's question.\\n\\n It's like, okay, it will be rare. But the alternative\\n\\n is that those rare, good claims, where there really has\\n\\n been a defective appellate process and a violation of\\n\\n the constitutional right to a fair appellate process has\\n\\n \\n52  been violated, and there's no way to correct for that in  the same way that there was no way to correct for the - the trial -- the ineffective trial counsel that we  talked about in Martinez and Trevino.</p><p> It did reaffirm the general  rule of Coleman except to the extent that this was your  only shot. And this is your only shot to raise a claim  of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, which is  a violation of a constitutional right.</p><p> That's all we're dealing  with here.</p><p> Yeah. Yeah. And then,\\n\\n General, I think that your brief did the right thing in\\n\\n terms of thinking about Martinez to say why did Martinez\\n\\n make the exception that it did and ask whether those\\n\\n same factors suggest an analogous exception here. I\\n\\n think that that's the right way to go about thinking\\n\\n about this question.\\n\\n So, I mean, it seems to me that your main\\n\\n theme here is this idea that you did get one shot; is --\\n\\n \\n\\n is that -- is that correct?\\n\\n39</p><p> Yeah --</p><p> Okay.</p><p> Okay. So the unique right,\\n\\n I mean, I think we've talked about. It's -- trial\\n\\n counsel, for sure, is the most, most, most important,\\n\\n but appellate counsel is pretty important too.\\n\\n But just let's think about this you -- you\\n\\n got one shot already. I guess I'm just not sure I\\n\\n understand it, because it seems to me what Martinez said\\n\\n is, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't get a shot to make your\\n\\n trial -- ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim,\\n\\n your IATC claim, and only if we made the exception that\\n\\n we did would you get a shot to make that trial counsel\\n\\n claim.\\n\\n And here, similarly, only if we do the same\\n\\n thing will you ever get a shot to make a claim that your\\n\\n appellate counsel was deficient. And people do have an\\n\\n independent, freestanding constitutional right to\\n\\n effective appellate counsel.\\n\\n \\n40</p><p> Because -- because there  is -- there's no right -- there's no need to have an  appellate process, but once the State has given an  appellate process, there is a right to have effective  assistance of counsel on appeal. So that seems an\\n \\n\\n important right.\\n\\n32</p><p> Could you respond to that  first? Is that okay, Justice Sotomayor?</p><p> -- just on a different  level.</p><p> I think if you read -</p><p> -- Martinez, Martinez  basically does not talk at all about the underlying  error. It talks about the ineffective assistance claim.  Now, of course, ineffective assistance is important  because, you know, it's not just the lawyers there for  show, it's -- it's to remedy or prevent some underlying  claim.  But the same is true here. If Martinez was  trying to figure out how to ensure the fairness of the  trial process, this would be trying to figure out how to  ensure, through effective counsel, the fairness of the  appellate process. And it seems to me quite analogous,  indeed identical -</p><p> But in -- in most States it\\n\\n does apply; isn't that right?</p><p> But this claim --</p><p> -- is not about the\\n\\n underlying trial error. This claim is about effective\\n\\n assistance of appellate counsel. And -- and -- and\\n\\n that's about ensuring that the appellate process has\\n\\n integrity and fairness attached to it.</p><p> But, General, that assumes\\n\\n that a -- that some court is going to say, if there was\\n\\n a trial error that we can see out there, then there was\\n\\n ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. But that's\\n\\n not correct for many of the reasons that people on -- I\\n\\n mean, that everybody acknowledges. To have ineffective\\n\\n assistance of appellate counsel, it's not because you\\n\\n failed to make an argument about any old trial error;\\n\\n it's going to be a special and rare thing.</p><p> It -- it ends, I think - you're exactly right. And I think it ends where the\\n \\n\\n Constitution gives out. Because we've said that\\n\\n43\\n\\n although the State does not have to set up an appeals\\n\\n process, once it sets up an appeals process, you are\\n\\n entitled to effective counsel in it. And so that's\\n\\n where it ends.</p><p> But, again -</p><p> -- General, you're sort  of -</p><p> -- redefining it so that it  fits your position. But Martinez was about having some  court evaluate the ineffective assistance of trial  claim, and this is about having some court evaluate the  ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.  And is there an underlying thing that we're  trying to get at? Sure. In Martinez, it was  ineffective assistance of trial counsel to ensure that  the trial process was fair. Here, it's -- it's -- it's  having some court litigate the ineffective assistance of  appellate counsel claim in order to ensure that the  appellate counsel is fair. So the two are quite  analogous.</p><p> Yes. And then there was\\n\\n Martinez. And as you said, in Martinez and in Trevino,\\n\\n we really went through the three factors that you talk\\n\\n about in your brief: How important is this? Is this\\n\\n the only shot? And, you know, does the State have\\n\\n something to do with this, or something. Is that the\\n\\n third one?\\n\\n And, you know, I'm -- I'm suggesting it's\\n\\n pretty important, and this is your only shot.</p><p> But here -- but here it's an\\n\\n appellate error.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>Or you could bring it on  State collateral.</p><p> Well, on the -- on the\\n\\n issue of whether or not Martinez should be extended to\\n\\n alleged inadequate assistance of counsel on appeal, what\\n\\n is the test that I'm supposed to apply? The -- the\\n\\n practicality of this? The consequences? The private\\n\\n interests of the prisoners and the public interest\\n\\n in finality -- is that what I'm supposed -- is there\\n\\n some test you want me to apply?</p><p> And when this test is\\n\\n applied, I -- I have -- have to say, it was somewhat\\n\\n \\n  stunning to me to read at page  of your brief that one  study indicates that although 81 percent of habeas  petitions in capital cases raise a claim of ineffective  assistance of counsel, only 31 percent alleged  ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, that's a  third of the cases. This is a tremendous burden.</p><p> No, but my question was,  was the systemic one, is -- is what are the systemic  standards I look to, to see whether or not we should  extend Martinez to this kind of case?</p><p> And then what guidance do  I have? It looked like Mathews v. Eldridge. I'm the\\n \\n\\n one that -- or this Court's the one that balances?</p><p> Yes. And just -- just to\\n\\n fortify your point, I take it there are any number of\\n\\n defense counsel objections that are overruled. So\\n\\n defense counsel has been adequate, but then if -- but\\n\\n then the appellate counsel may very well overlook some\\n\\n of those. And that -- and so -- so the idea that\\n\\n there's not going to be IAC at the appellate level if\\n\\n there was not IAC at the trial level, it seems to me,\\n\\n not -- not sound.\\n\\n \\n30</p><p> Could you address my  question to the Petitioner's counsel? What is the  standard of -- we're supposed to follow in deciding this  case? Our view of the systemic consequences? And - and what is -- what -- what is the case authority that  gives us instruction in that regard?</p>\", 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR': \"<p>Counsel, you're not  dealing with the question asked.</p><p> All right? The question  asked has to do with the burden on the courts. Both  Justice Kennedy and Justice Roberts are saying, if we  recognize this right, the courts are going to be  inundated with these kinds of claims because in every  State, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel  isn't -- can't be, by definition, raised in direct  review. It all has to be channelled to collateral  review. So in every State, every defendant will be able  to raise this claim and it will inundate the -- the  system.</p><p> There's -- the appellate  review is on the basis of the record as it exists, not  on one that should have existed.</p><p> I'm sorry. That's not  the test -- that's not the test. The test is, would it  have resulted in a -- a difference on appellate review,  not at trial.</p><p> And you haven't  articulated the reasons you don't think so.</p><p> I could start with how\\n \\n  many post-conviction ineffective assistance of appellate  counsel cases, the 31 percent that Justice Kennedy was  pointing to, in how many of those is relief granted?</p><p> Infinitesimally small.</p><p> You mean the substantial\\n\\n claim of IAC? This is -- no one is going to be looking\\n\\n at an ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim,\\n\\n assuming one is viable, unless there's a substantial\\n\\n claim, and no one will otherwise look at it.</p><p> So let's go through the  three pillars here. No one is reviewing whether  appellate counsel has been adequate. Do you -- although  you're not entitled constitutionally to appellate  counsel on direct appeal, I don't know that we haven't,  repeatedly, and so has every other court recognized the  importance of counsel at the appellate level. I think  virtually every State, if not every State, gives you a  lawyer. So that prong is, in my mind, equal.  The second prong is the -</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Ah, but does that - does that mean that we don't remedy that? Assuming - because, I agree -- Justice Breyer pointed out, and  others have, the number of cases are going to be tiny.  And as with all cases, there's an initial uptick of  claims until people settle down and realize that it's a  small number that are viable, and that happens pretty  quickly. Do we ignore that simply because there might\\n \\n\\n be that small uptick at the beginning?</p><p> I'm sorry. I -- I --\\n\\n they're only -- they're not asking the question on the\\n\\n trial court whether appellate counsel has erred. They\\n\\n are asking a different question.</p><p> Not just error, but\\n\\n error likely to result in a different outcome.</p><p> But we already know that\\n\\n even under plain-error review, because we've done it\\n\\n in -- in a number of different cases, that trial courts\\n\\n err.</p><p> The question is, did\\n\\n appellate counsel err in failing to raise something that\\n\\n might ultimately go to the Supreme Court, as has\\n\\n happened.</p><p> They have ruled on --\\n\\n they've ruled on a question of error below, but not a\\n\\n question of appellate counsel error.</p><p> How many were granted?</p><p> Well, that's an  interesting open question.</p><p> But I have -</p><p> May I ask you, when do  you believe that counsel below objected? And your brief  seems to assume he did, but as I read the transcript, I  can't find where he objected clearly.\\n \\n  Assuming he didn't object clearly, can you  say under any circumstance that appellate counsel was  ineffective for choosing the route he did?</p><p> Given plain error  review, if there was no objection, wasn't the  sufficiency of the evidence the best way to approach a  forfeited error?</p><p> He objected to the  sequence of what the judge was saying. He didn't argue  any transferred intent in the way that the Court later  found in Roberts. I think it's Roberts, if I'm -</p><p> -- if my memory is  correct.</p><p> He didn't -- I don't see  any discussion of the Roberts transferred intent. All  he argued was, give the original instruction over again,  and then give this new one.</p>\"}, {'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': \"<p>Thank you, counsel.  Case is submitted.

BLATT  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS</p>\", 'JUSTICE ALITO': \"<p>But you say -- where - where do I look to find that? And where do I look to  find the provision that says what you say, which is that  the entity that establishes the plan is financially  responsible?</p><p> But where is the provision  of ERISA that supports what you said, which is -- it  seems to me to be a significant point, that the entity  that establishes the plan is financially responsible for  the plan. What is the provision of ERISA -</p><p> -- that says that?</p><p> Well, in the situation where\\n\\n the church establishes the plan and then turns over the\\n\\n maintenance of the plan to a principal-purpose\\n\\n organization, the audits would be the books of the\\n\\n principal-purpose organization. There wouldn't be very\\n\\n much to look for in the records of the church.\\n\\n \\n47  So if that's the -- if that was the purpose  of it, I don't see what the establishment requirement -</p><p> It's -- it's responsible - it's responsible to the extent the plan makes it  responsible?

But, I\\n\\n mean, you said that this is primarily -- oh, don't worry\\n\\n about the penalties; this is primarily about\\n\\n forward-looking things. And yet the complaints asked\\n\\n for the penalties. Are you willing on behalf of your\\n\\n clients to disavow any requests for penalties?</p><p> Then how can you say that\\n\\n it's primarily about forward-looking.</p><p> -- remedies.</p><p> Well, they had to --</p><p> -- whatever -- whatever\\n\\n \\n\\n reliance was reasonable based on these hundreds of\\n\\n37\\n\\n letters, that's one thing. How about relying on the\\n\\n literal meaning of the central statutory provision?</p><p> Well, I'm talking about --</p><p> And it's as simple as that,\\n\\n that read literally, it is not required that it be\\n\\n established --</p><p> -- by a church. Now, you\\n\\n have other arguments, but --</p><p> -- the literal language of\\n\\n (C)(i), and you're now talking about everything else.\\n\\n The literal language of (C)(i) says: A plan established\\n\\n and maintained by a church includes a plan that is\\n\\n \\n\\n maintained by a principal-purpose organization.\\n\\n38</p>\", 'JUSTICE BREYER': \"<p>I'm assuming they are a  principal-purpose organization.</p><p> Fine.

And it's pretty clear that you\\n\\n would read, you know, the one about disabled veterans\\n\\n and the one about the two presidential criteria, and\\n\\n it's pretty clear that you would read those sentences\\n\\n their way rather than your way; in other words, as just\\n\\n going to one of the criteria. And I'm wondering why you\\n\\n think that's true, that they can come up with these\\n\\n hypotheticals that so clearly should be interpreted\\n\\n their way rather than your way.</p><p> I mean, that would seem\\n\\n ridiculous, right?</p><p> See, I -- I would think that\\n\\n the way that hypothetical works, it's sort of -- we're\\n\\n setting these two criteria, you have to be a veteran and\\n\\n you have to be disabled, and then we're going to say\\n\\n there's a special case of veterans. We also mean to\\n\\n include National Guard folks, and that's not\\n\\n disqualifying, the fact that it's a National Guard\\n\\n folks. But the two criteria are still the two criteria.\\n\\n All we're suggesting is that it's not disqualifying that\\n\\n you are a National Guard. And you could read this\\n\\n language similarly. It's not disqualifying that it's\\n\\n maintained by a different kind of organization.</p><p> Well, but I guess that's the\\n\\n question, right?</p><p> And the structure is the\\n\\n same.</p><p> Well, still, Ms. Blatt,  there is a -- you know, there would be a simple way of  accomplishing what you think this provision  accomplishes. You know, something along the lines of  just saying any plan maintained by a church-affiliated  organization is a church plan or something like that.  It's -- it's very odd language, this  statutory language, and I'm wondering why you think that  Congress chose to do what you think it chose to do in\\n \\n\\n this perplexing way rather than in a straightforward\\n\\n\\n\\n way?</p><p> Well, why would you -</p><p> Why would you repeat the  requirement of the A? In other words, Congress could  have just said a plan maintained by a church includes a  plan maintained by one of these organizations.</p><p> But I would have thought  that the -- the one thing that seems most clear from a  pretty murky legislative history is the church pension  boards were supposed to be included in this. And the  church pension boards, some of them were established --\\n \\n44  their plans were established by the church, some of them  not. So you would be taking out some of these church  pension boards that I thought are the sort of  quintessential group that this was designed to include.</p>\", 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"<p>But it -- but it led to - but it led to hundreds of letters from the IRS.

I mean,  these hospitals, some of them, like Dignity, the  Catholic church has disavowed any formal affiliation  with it.</p><p> The pension plans.</p><p> Let's go to that 1982.  Tell me how your reading of the statute includes the  organizations that were clamoring and for whom the IRS  had said were covered by this provision: The pension  boards that were separate from the church, and Ms. Blatt  pointed to the sisters, the nuns, who were also seeking  coverage. How does your reading take care of those two  situations facing Congress?</p><p> Mr. Feldman --\\n \\n43</p><p> Mr. Feldman, I have a  starting question, which is I'm torn. This could be  read either way in my mind. If I believe that, what do  I go to, to break the tie?</p><p> Why? There was a  provision that was proposed that would have done very  clearly what you think this provision does now. And  Congress didn't pass it. So an earlier version did  exactly what you wanted. It said you can -- a plan that  establishes and/or maintained by a church.</p><p> Mr. Feldman, why do you  think -- I mean, I've -- I have read all your arguments  about why the IRS letters are not entitled to deference.  But I come at it from a different point, which is it was  in part these private organizations, religious  organizations, but the IRS, too, who was lobbying\\n \\n58  Congress to express itself on this issue and take care  of what the IRS knew was a problem for all these people.  And then all of a sudden, almost immediately after the  legislation is passed, the IRS is believing and stating  that it's done more than you claim.  Isn't that, in itself, evidence -- not the  Skidmore deference -- but evidence that the agency  believed that the answer was different than you're  promoting right now?</p><p> They thought or they  assumed -</p><p> Rightly or wrongly, they  assumed that this language fixed it and fixed it how  they were describing it in these letters.</p><p> Except they knew there  was a problem.</p>\"}]\n"
