# SupremeCourtCasesVisualization

This is a simple mapping project during my study at Columbia Journalism School. It attempts to map Supreme Court's cases during the 2016 term (argument session: April 17, 2017 - April 26, 2017) per justices and location. Based on data from the Oyez Project, an online multimedia archive from the Illinois Institute of Technology's Chicago-Kent College of Law, my map lists basic information about Supreme Court cases and analysis of their oral arguments.

This project counts how many times each justice speak in each case. In the drop-down menu, users can select individual justice and check what exactly he or she spoke during the oral argument per case. Hope it can be a useful tool for people who are interested in analyzing ideological leaning of Supreme Court justices.
